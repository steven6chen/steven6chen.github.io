Antepartum assessment and neonatal management of these pregnancies, and monoamniotic twin pregnancy, are discussed separately.

In the absence of a spontaneous or medically indicated preterm delivery, the optimum time to deliver ongoing twin pregnancies depends on chorionicity and amnionicity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dichorionic twin pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For normal uncomplicated <span class=\"nowrap\">dichorionic/diamniotic</span> twin pregnancies, we suggest planned delivery at 38+0<sup> </sup>to 38+6 weeks of gestation, in agreement with recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Twin pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction are delivered earlier than 38 weeks, with the timing dependent on the clinical scenario.</p><p>There are no high-quality data from randomized trials on which to base a recommendation for the optimum timing of delivery of <span class=\"nowrap\">dichorionic/diamniotic</span> twins. The optimal length of gestation appears to be shorter in twin than in singleton pregnancies. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the lowest rate of perinatal mortality (PNM) occurs at 37 to 39 weeks in twin pregnancies versus 39 to 41 weeks in singleton pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Within this 37 to 39 week range, neonatal morbidity can be minimized by intervention at 38 to 39 weeks versus 37 to 38 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although the authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials on the timing of delivery in uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies recommended delivery at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks, we do not believe their data warrant a firm conclusion. The authors found that in dichorionic twins, the prospective risk of stillbirth was equivalent to the rate of neonatal death between 37+0 and 37+6 weeks, and the risk of stillbirth significantly exceeded the risk of neonatal death at 38+0 to 38+6 weeks and later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rates of neonatal morbidity, including respiratory distress syndrome, septicemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were all lower at later gestational ages. These data, however, are limited by the absence of data about quality of ultrasound examination, antepartum fetal monitoring, mode of delivery, and level of neonatal care. Without such data, it is difficult to assess the impact of a policy of delivering all dichorionic twins prior to 38 weeks of gestation. Therefore, we continue to recommend planned delivery of uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies at 38+0 to 38+6 weeks, although planned delivery at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks is a reasonable alternative based on the limited data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of pulmonary maturity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACOG has opined that invasive fetal pulmonary maturity testing by amniocentesis &quot;generally should not be used for determination of timing of delivery&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If amniocentesis to determine fetal lung maturity before 37 weeks is performed, some authors, including ourselves, feel that amniocentesis of only one twin is adequate if the gestation is &ge;36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], but others test both twins in all cases because pulmonary maturity can be asynchronous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When only one sac is sampled, it would be reasonable to sample the sac of the fetus less likely to be mature. As an example, a larger, nonpresenting male fetus would be less likely to have achieved lung maturity than a smaller, presenting female fetus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of fetal lung maturity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are some data that fetuses of twin gestations may experience more rapid pulmonary maturation than singleton fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; however, this assertion has been challenged by conflicting data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The potential for neonatal respiratory problems is particularly important when considering the optimal timing of delivery of twins since many of these pregnancies are delivered by cesarean birth prior to the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>As with singletons, there appears to be a significant risk of respiratory problems in preterm and early term twins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated the prevalence of neonatal respiratory disorders in the infants of 126 women with twins who underwent planned cesarean delivery before labor (at 36 to 40 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The majority (65 percent) of cesarean deliveries were performed due to malpresentation in one or both fetuses; there were no maternal or fetal complications (eg, severe preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction) requiring medically indicated delivery. Neonatal respiratory disorders occurred frequently, and more often among infants born at 36 to 37 compared to 38 or more weeks of gestation (13 versus 2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of twins delivered by the vaginal or abdominal route, the prevalence of respiratory morbidity at 36 to 37 weeks was 23 percent, compared to 7 percent at 37 to 38 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Monochorionic twin pregnancy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31721736\"><span class=\"h3\">Diamniotic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the optimum time for delivery of <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twin gestations. While it is not clear that planned delivery prior to 37 weeks of gestation is warranted in every apparently uncomplicated <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], it is our practice, and that of other experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/7,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22-27</a>], to discuss the increased risk of intrauterine demise and offer early delivery of <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twins. It is our practice to suggest delivery at 36+0<sup> </sup>weeks of gestation or soon thereafter (before 36+6 weeks). Delivery at this time provides a reasonable trade-off between the morbidity of preterm birth, which falls with advancing gestational age, and the risk of unanticipated subsequent fetal demise. Although some society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>] suggest delaying delivery to gestational ages up to 37+6 weeks is appropriate, the potential for stillbirth even in apparently uncomplicated <span class=\"nowrap\">monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twin pregnancies and the low rates of neonatal morbidity at 36+0 to 36+6 weeks in our hospital lead us to suggest late preterm rather than early term delivery. We do not perform amniocentesis to document lung maturity prior to delivery. </p><p>A 2016 systematic review of timing of delivery in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies recommended delivery at 36+0 to 36+6 weeks because of a trend toward higher risks of stillbirths than neonatal deaths beyond this gestational age; however, the analysis was limited by the absence of data about quality of ultrasound examination, antepartum fetal monitoring, mode of delivery, and level of neonatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>ACOG suggests delivery of monochorionic twins at 34+0 to 37+6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the North American Fetal Therapy Network suggests delivery at 36+0 to 37+6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some authorities have argued for delivery as early as 32 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/22,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-31</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Monochorionic/diamniotic</span> twin pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome are delivered earlier.

Delivery earlier in the third trimester may be indicated because of the high rate of perinatal mortality described in these pregnancies despite intensive fetal surveillance, (30 to 70 percent, which is likely due to cord entanglement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The presentation and, in some situations, the gestational age of twins can influence the selection of vaginal versus cesarean delivery. However, in most cases, women with twin pregnancies with the presenting twin in cephalic presentation should be counseled to attempt vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Should routine cesarean delivery be offered?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cesarean delivery is common in twin pregnancies: over 60 percent of twin births are by cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Some investigators have proposed that neonatal outcome could be improved by a policy of planned cesarean delivery for all twin pregnancies. The basis for this proposal is concern that the relative risk of anoxic death of the second twin is increased as a result of mechanical problems (eg, compound presentation, cord prolapse, abruptio placentae) after vaginal birth of the first twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; this is most significant in gestations &ge;36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, others have pointed out that even though the relative risk of neonatal mortality may be increased, the absolute risk remains low and, therefore, a large number of cesareans would have to be done to prevent one death of a second twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Cesarean delivery also poses short-term and long-term risks to the mother, although maternal outcomes are similar at three months postpartum for both planned cesarean and planned vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Long-term risks'</a>.)</p><p>We do not favor a policy of planned cesarean delivery of all twin pregnancies. With appropriate intrapartum monitoring and management (see below), the second twin is not at high risk of neonatal mortality or morbidity with trial of labor, even when remote from term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Should VLBW fetuses be delivered by cesarean?'</a> below.)</p><p>We choose a delivery route based upon presentation and amnionicity (see below), as well as the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of standard obstetrical indications for cesarean delivery (eg, placenta previa). We favor a trial of labor for concordant diamniotic twins with the first twin in cephalic presentation. </p><p>The following evidence supports this approach: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Twin Birth Study randomly assigned 1398 women between 32+0 and 38+6 weeks of gestation with twin pregnancy with the first twin in cephalic presentation to planned cesarean or planned vaginal delivery (cesarean only if indicated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Delivery was planned between 37+5 and 38+6 weeks of gestation. The rate of cesarean delivery was 90.7 percent in the planned cesarean delivery group and 43.8 percent in the planned vaginal delivery group, illustrating the high frequency of cesarean even when vaginal delivery is planned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The study found no significant difference in the composite outcome (fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity) between the planned cesarean and the planned vaginal delivery groups (2.2 versus 1.9 percent, respectively; odds ratio 1.16; 95% CI 0.77-1.74). At two years of age, both groups had similar rates of death or neurodevelopmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This trial represents the best available evidence that planned cesarean delivery does not significantly improve neonatal or early childhood outcome as compared with planned vaginal delivery for twins with the first twin in a cephalic presentation, including those with a noncephalic-presenting second twin.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2011 systematic review (18 studies, over 39,000 twin sets), for twins with <span class=\"nowrap\">cephalic/cephalic</span> presentation, vaginal delivery was safer than cesarean for the first twin, and was as safe as cesarean for the second twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In pregnancies with <span class=\"nowrap\">cephalic/noncephalic</span> presentation, a trial of labor was a safe option in the absence of risk factors that increased the risk of a cesarean delivery of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin, although predicting combined delivery was essentially impossible antepartum. Neonatal morbidity rates for planned vaginal and planned cesarean delivery were 15.1 and 7.4 percent, respectively (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.65-1.88); mortality rates were 0.7 and 0.1 percent, respectively (OR 3.04; 95% CI 0.37-25.2).

Smaller series have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/78-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-84</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is our practice to offer a trial of labor to women with twin pregnancies and one prior cesarean delivery, provided they go into spontaneous labor. Because the most common initial sign of uterine rupture is fetal heart rate changes, we continually monitor both fetuses.

Intermittent auscultation is not practical and may not reliably distinguish one twin from the other.</p><p>The fetal heart rate of each twin can be monitored using a single machine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68893\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68893 \">waveform 1</a>). These rates are often synchronous, thus requiring frequent careful review of the tracing to make sure each fetus' heart rate is being monitored. Ultrasound can assist in ensuring that both fetal heart rates are traced. If separate monitors are used, internal clocks must be synchronized, paper speeds must be identical, and contractions must be displayed on both tracings.</p><p>Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is particularly useful for assessing the well-being of the second twin during the high risk period after delivery of the first twin (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Interval between delivery of the two twins'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia and anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural <span class=\"nowrap\">analgesia/anesthesia</span> is generally recommended because it provides good pain relief, does not cause neonatal depression, and is a suitable anesthetic if uterine manipulation (eg, version) or operative delivery (eg, forceps, cesarean) becomes necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">First twin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a variety of reasons, morbidity and mortality tend to be lower in first born than second born twins, regardless of route of delivery. A systematic review of observational studies reported the overall neonatal morbidity of first and second twins was 3.0 and 4.6 percent, respectively (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.70), and overall neonatal mortality was 0.3 and 0.6 percent, respectively (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>When vaginal birth is attempted, the capacity for immediate cesarean delivery is important in the event that complications necessitating urgent delivery arise (eg, prolapsed umbilical cord, nonreassuring fetal heart rate, or failed breech <span class=\"nowrap\">extraction/cephalic</span> version). Emergency cesarean delivery has been reported in 10 to 30 percent of pregnancies in which vaginal births of twins had been planned, and may be necessary for delivery of the second twin after vaginal birth of the first twin (see below). It is our practice to deliver all twin pregnancies in an operating room where cesarean delivery can be performed. In our hospital, patients are moved to the operating room in the second stage of labor. However, if a patient can be transported to an operating room rapidly, delivery of cephalic-cephalic twins in a labor room is not unreasonable.</p><p>Delivery of the first twin of a diamniotic pair is similar to delivery of a singleton except the umbilical cords should be marked with progressive numbers of clamps (eg, one for the first twin birth, two for the second twin birth). If surgical clamps are used initially, they should be replaced with a like number of plastic umbilical cord clamps prior to sending the placenta for formal examination. Recall that 'twin A' on ultrasound may not be first born at delivery (especially if the delivery is by cesarean), and this infant is typically called 'baby A' by delivery room and nursery personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-100</a>].</p><p>In monochorionic twins, signs of acute peripartum twin-twin transfusion syndrome include bradycardia or a sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern, and may necessitate urgent delivery.</p><p>In all monochorionic twins, it is important to promptly clamp the umbilical cord after delivery of the first twin as the in utero co-twin could develop hypovolemic shock from exsanguinating into the placenta and out the unclamped cord of the first twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Monochorionic twins are not good candidates for delayed cord clamping. For dichorionic twins, we concur with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation for a delay in umbilical cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth in vigorous term and preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Second twin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second born twins have been reported to have a higher incidence of adverse outcome (morbidity and mortality) due to lower birth weight; higher frequency of malpresentation, cord prolapse, and abruptio placentae; and more deliveries involving internal podalic version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/36,102-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,102-105</a>].</p><p>After delivery of the first twin, the heart rate and position of the second twin should be evaluated using ultrasound and electronic fetal monitoring. Among cephalic presenting twins undergoing a trial of labor, 12 percent of second twins were found to be in a noncephalic presentation after delivery of the first twin, in one large study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. If the second twin is in a noncephalic presentation, ultrasound can be used to assist external cephalic version, breech extraction, or internal podalic version of the second twin, if necessary. </p><p>As discussed above, our preference is breech extraction if the second twin is not in a cephalic presentation and there are no contraindications to breech extraction (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Cephalic-noncephalic twins'</a> above). Intrauterine manipulation is aided by ultrasonographic visualization of the orientation between the physician's hands and fetal parts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58961%7EOBGYN%2F71779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58961 graphicRef71779 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>] and can be facilitated by administering intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or inhalational anesthesia, which relax uterine muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Effective maternal analgesia is also crucial. When the fetus is in the desired presentation for delivery, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> is given if labor has not resumed. Amniotomy is avoided until after the presenting part is engaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/42,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,109</a>].</p><p>Others have taken a somewhat different approach. One historic cohort study of 130 planned vaginal twin deliveries reported no patient who had a vaginal delivery of the first twin required cesarean delivery of the second twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In this group's practice, all patients who were undelivered at 38 weeks of gestation underwent induction if they met strict criteria (estimated weight of the second twin &ge;1500 grams and no more than 20 percent greater than the weight of the presenting twin, absence of usual contraindications to vaginal delivery). After vaginal birth of the first twin, the second twin was delivered as a cephalic presentation if the head was engaged immediately after delivery of the first twin, by breech extraction if in breech presentation after delivery of the first twin, and by breech extraction after internal podalic version if in cephalic presentation but unengaged after delivery of the first twin. The authors attributed their success to active management of the second stage of labor by obstetricians experienced in breech delivery and internal podalic version, and to their criteria for selecting candidates for vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Interval between delivery of the two twins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, a prolonged interval between delivery of the first and second twins was thought to be associated with poorer outcomes. Intervals of less than 25 to 30 minutes have been advocated, and maneuvers such as internal podalic version or breech extraction of the second twin were often recommended to hasten delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-112</a>].</p><p>Subsequent studies undertaken after the universal routine use of electronic fetal monitoring during labor suggest that there does not have to be a finite interval between delivery of the first and second twin, as long as the fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/113-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-115</a>]. Electronic fetal monitoring and the availability of real-time ultrasound have enabled obstetricians to identify those second twins who would benefit from expedited delivery, while allowing most cases to be managed expectantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

As an example, a population based cohort study of twin deliveries in the United States reported 9.5 percent of second twins were delivered by cesarean after vaginal birth of the first twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

It is of importance to parents and twins to know whether same sex twins are monozygotic (in lay terms, &quot;identical&quot;). Based upon a genotype and placental study of 668 consecutive twin pairs in Birmingham, England, parents of naturally-conceived twins can be informed in the delivery room that 37 percent of all same sex twins are &quot;identical&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].
