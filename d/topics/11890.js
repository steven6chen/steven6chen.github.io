It is usually asymptomatic and most often diagnosed during cardiac monitoring (eg, continuous ambulatory electrocardiography or inpatient telemetry) or on an exercise test performed for other reasons.</p><p>The presence of NSVT has long been recognized as a potential marker for the development of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. However, while NSVT predicts overall mortality, it doesn&rsquo;t specifically predict sudden cardiac death (SCD). Unfortunately, our understanding of which patients with NSVT are at greatest risk for lethal arrhythmias or how the NSVT relates to the lethal arrhythmias is still quite rudimentary. One clearly established premise is that NSVT in the presence of structural heart disease carries a more serious prognosis than NSVT in the absence of a cardiac abnormality. Since NSVT doesn&rsquo;t specifically predict SCD, the nature of the underlying structural heart disease is the primary determinant of mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsustained-vt-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsustained VT in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two general goals in the management of NSVT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of patients at risk for malignant, sustained arrhythmias and SCD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment to suppress symptoms caused by NSVT, when present and clinically significant</p><p/><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and management of NSVT.

Most patients with NSVT will have a history of underlying structural heart disease (eg, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, etc), although NSVT can also be seen in patients without known structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsustained-vt-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsustained VT in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The type and intensity of symptoms, if present, will vary depending upon the rate and duration of the NSVT along with the presence or absence of significant comorbid conditions. Patients with NSVT who notice symptoms typically present with one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or presyncope</p><p/><p>Most commonly, symptomatic patients will report palpitations that may or may not be associated with chest pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shortness of breath. If the duration of the episode approaches 20 to 30 seconds with an associated rate of NSVT that is rapid enough to result in hemodynamic compromise, patients may experience presyncope or even syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801201708\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few physical examination findings in patients with NSVT are unique and specific. By definition, patients will have a pulse exceeding 100 beats per minute during the episode. In addition, if the physical examination coincides with an episode of NSVT, this can reveal evidence of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, which is present in up to 75 percent of patients with VT, although it is not always easy to detect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. During AV dissociation, the normal coordination of atrial and ventricular contraction is lost, which may produce characteristic physical examination findings including (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'AV dissociation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked fluctuations in the blood pressure because of the variability in the degree of left atrial contribution to left ventricular filling, stroke volume, and cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability in the occurrence and intensity of heart sounds (especially S1) (&quot;cacophony of heart sounds&quot;), which is heard more frequently when the rate of the tachycardia is slower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannon &quot;A&quot; waves &ndash; Cannon A waves are intermittent and irregular jugular venous pulsations of greater amplitude than normal waves. They reflect simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation, resulting in contraction of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve. Prominent A waves can also be seen during some SVTs. Such prominent waves result from simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction occurring with every beat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2448414553\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected NSVT should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram, although NSVT is frequently identified on continuous telemetric monitoring, in which case only one or two leads may be available for review. As with the interpretation of any ECG, the standard initial approach to diagnosis of NSVT includes an assessment of rate, regularity, axis, QRS duration, and QRS morphology. NSVT typically generates a wide QRS complex, usually with a QRS width &gt;0.12 seconds. A full discussion of the ECG features of VT is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1917592205\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) has been identified, reversible causes of arrhythmia should be sought, including electrolyte imbalances, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, adverse drug effects, anemia, hypotension, and heart failure. For patients who have only a single asymptomatic episode of NSVT, often no further investigation is required. However, for patients with multiple episodes or for those with symptoms felt to be related to NSVT, a thorough diagnostic evaluation to exclude structural heart disease is warranted, including cardiac imaging and ambulatory ECG monitoring for most patients and invasive electrophysiology studies (EPS) only on rare occasions. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent episodes or those who are highly symptomatic, even young, otherwise healthy patients need a thorough cardiac imaging evaluation to exclude entities such as undiagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Typically, the evaluation for structural heart disease includes an imaging study of the heart, most commonly echocardiography, although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is also reasonable (if locally available) as it provides the most detailed structural information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring is indicated in many patients with NSVT with vague symptoms to establish a correlation between symptoms and arrhythmia and to quantify the frequency of the arrhythmia. Ambulatory monitoring is also useful to exclude the presence of sustained VT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise treadmill testing is indicated in patients with exercise-related symptoms or NSVT and in patients with suspected coronary ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a signal-averaged ECG can be useful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive EPS are rarely required in the initial evaluation of NSVT. In patients with syncope, near-syncope, or sustained palpitations, EPS should be considered to evaluate for the presence of sustained VT. In addition, in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 35 to 40 percent, and NSVT, invasive EPS may be used to risk stratify patients for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p>An in-depth discussion of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with VT is presented separately.

Differentiating VT from other causes of WCT may be difficult, particularly if a high-quality 12-lead ECG is not available during the time of the arrhythmia. In general, however, a WCT, particularly when poorly tolerated, should be considered to be VT until proven otherwise. </p><p>The approach to the differential diagnosis of VT from other causes of WCT is discussed separately.

Many patients with NSVT will have coexisting cardiac conditions in which beta blockers are also indicated (eg, coronary heart disease, heart failure), in which case the patient may derive multiple benefits from the use of beta blockers. For patients with NSVT who remain symptomatic in spite of beta blockers, or who are unable to tolerate beta blockers due to side effects, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) can be added to the medical regimen, although these agents should not be used in patients with uncontrolled heart failure. Antiarrhythmic medications are generally reserved for patients with severely symptomatic NSVT despite therapy with beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers who are not candidates for catheter ablation of the VT.</p><p>NSVT is most often asymptomatic, but some patients experience palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, presyncope, or syncope. Because many of the symptoms that may be attributed to NSVT are vague and nonspecific, it is important to try to correlate symptoms to episodes of NSVT before initiating therapy specifically to treat NSVT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2143679402\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic NSVT, we suggest beta blockers. This preference is based on significant indirect evidence of the efficacy of beta blockers for reducing ventricular ectopy and tachyarrhythmias in other cardiac conditions, as well as coadministration of beta blockers for other cardiac conditions and the fact that beta blockers are generally safe and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoprolol</a> (usual effective dose 50 to 200 mg daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> (usual effective dose 12.5 to 50 mg daily) are the most commonly prescribed beta blockers for the suppression of NSVT.

For most patients, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are better tolerated and associated with less toxicity than antiarrhythmic drugs. However, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with structural heart disease or uncontrolled heart failure.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT trial), which was not primarily designed as a randomized ICD clinical trial but rather to study the management of high-risk patients using the results of electrophysiology study (EPS), enrolled 704 patients with a prior MI (less than one month to more than three years previously), asymptomatic NSVT, an LVEF &le;40 percent, and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to no therapy or EP-guided antiarrhythmic therapy, which included either an antiarrhythmic agent (class IA with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>) or an ICD if at least one antiarrhythmic agent was ineffective; the primary end point was arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest, with a secondary endpoint of total mortality. The reduction in the primary and secondary end points in the electrophysiologically guided group was largely attributable to ICD therapy; at five years the primary end point occurred in 9 percent of those receiving an ICD, compared with 37 percent of those receiving an antiarrhythmic drug, and the secondary end point occurred in 24 and 55 percent, respectively. There was no difference in outcome between patients receiving no therapy and those treated with an antiarrhythmic drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68247\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68247 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsustained-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients with asymptomatic NSVT may also be considered for an ICD in the presence of structural heart disease with LVEF &lt;40 percent. Many patients will meet other criteria for primary prevention with an ICD. For post-MI patients with moderate LV dysfunction (ie, LVEF 35 to 40 percent), who do not otherwise meet current criteria for ICD implantation, NSVT remains an indication for EPS and possible ICD implantation.

(See <a href=\"#H9005219\" class=\"local\">'Definition of NSVT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with NSVT are usually asymptomatic, although some patients may notice symptoms associated with episodes of NSVT. The type and intensity of symptoms, which may include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or presyncope, will vary depending upon the rate and duration of the NSVT along with the presence or absence of significant comorbid conditions. (See <a href=\"#H3530271991\" class=\"local\">'History and associated symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few physical examination findings in patients with NSVT are unique and specific. By definition, patients will have a pulse exceeding 100 beats per minute during the episode. In addition, if the physical examination coincides with an episode of NSVT, this can reveal evidence of atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, including marked fluctuations in blood pressure, variability in the occurrence and intensity of heart sounds (especially S1), and cannon A waves. (See <a href=\"#H801201708\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with suspected NSVT should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), although NSVT is frequently identified on continuous telemetric monitoring, in which case only one or two leads may be available for review. (See <a href=\"#H2448414553\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) has been identified, reversible causes of arrhythmia should be sought, including electrolyte imbalances, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, adverse drug effects, anemia, hypotension, and heart failure. For patients who have only a single asymptomatic episode of NSVT, often no further investigation is required. However, for patients with multiple episodes or for those with symptoms felt to be related to NSVT, a thorough diagnostic evaluation to exclude structural heart disease is warranted, including cardiac imaging and ambulatory ECG monitoring for most patients and invasive electrophysiology studies (EPS) only on rare occasions. (See <a href=\"#H1917592205\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of patients with NSVT is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with NSVT and no identified symptoms do not require any specific therapy directed toward the NSVT. However, some patients with NSVT who are found to have a cardiomyopathy with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function may be evaluated for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death related to sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H1005947740\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic NSVT, we suggest beta blockers rather than calcium channel blockers or antiarrhythmic medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2143679402\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with NSVT who remain symptomatic in spite of beta blockers, or who are unable to tolerate beta blockers due to side effects, we suggest adding a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) rather than an antiarrhythmic medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1117263086\" class=\"local\">'Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For some patients who have frequent, highly symptomatic NSVT not adequately suppressed by beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, the addition of antiarrhythmic medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) may be helpful. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> as the initial choice, rather than other antiarrhythmic drugs, based on its efficacy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
