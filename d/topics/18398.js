In order to make this decision, both clinicians and patients typically desire individualized information about (1) the chance of VBAC and (2) the balance between the risks of maternal or fetal morbidity with TOLAC compared with ERCD.</p><p>This information is also important on a population level, especially in the setting of a rising cesarean delivery rate, as selection of candidates who are most likely to deliver vaginally after a previous cesarean can minimize the costs of ERCD and failed TOLAC. The cost-effectiveness of TOLAC is dependent on the likelihood of VBAC. In a decision analytic model with a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 women undergoing TOLAC versus ERCD, TOLAC was cost-effective when the likelihood of VBAC was &gt;47.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In another study, if all women who were calculated to be good candidates for VBAC underwent TOLAC, the cesarean rate would have been reduced from 70.4 to 25.5 percent (assuming a VBAC rate of 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the use of calculators for counseling women about TOLAC. All other issues related to TOLAC are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27829340\"><span class=\"h1\">GOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of TOLAC calculators and models is to predict a woman's chance of VBAC based on her demographic and clinical risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. The chance of VBAC is not only important as a direct measure of outcome but also as an indirect measure of maternal morbidity: Major maternal morbidity is lowest in women who have VBAC (morbidity 0.2 percent), higher in women who undergo ERCD (morbidity 0.8 percent), and highest in women who have a repeat cesarean delivery after a failed TOLAC (morbidity 3.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although a TOLAC calculator or model can predict the probability of vaginal birth, which is a key concern of women contemplating TOLAC versus ERCD, a variety of other factors also influence a woman's decision regarding route of delivery. These factors are not addressed by calculators and are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth#H4152237431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;, section on 'Shared decision-making'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592050486\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF TOLAC SUCCESS AND FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2010 meta-analysis, the two risk factors that increased the odds of VBAC by at least threefold were history of VBAC and history of vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The most important factor associated with failed TOLAC (ie, cesarean delivery) was a prior cesarean delivery for a recurring indication, such as failure to progress. Other factors that played a role, but were not as strongly associated with failed TOLAC, were non-white <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> increasing body mass index, and older maternal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108701 \">table 1</a>). Although induction of labor significantly reduced the odds of VBAC compared with entering labor spontaneously, a better control group would have been women who were managed expectantly. However, no randomized trials have compared women with a prior cesarean delivery who were induced with those managed expectantly at any given gestational age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554852\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCULATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several calculators are available for predicting the chance of VBAC.

The calculator includes fields for maternal age, height, weight, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> options for the following fields: African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, prior vaginal delivery, prior VBAC, and prior cesarean for arrest of dilation or descent. It has been validated in women with one or two prior cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The MFMU Network entry to prenatal care calculator was created using a multivariable logistic regression model in a prospective cohort of women undergoing a trial of labor with a term singleton fetus in cephalic presentation after one prior low transverse cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of the study population of 11,856 women, 73 percent delivered vaginally. The overall predictive capability of the model was fair to good, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.77) (a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve plots true positives against false positives; a test with AUC 0.5 is equivalent to a coin toss whereas AUC 1.0 accurately discriminates between true positives and false positives). The best performance was in women with a predicted probability of vaginal delivery greater than 35 percent. Imprecision below 50 percent is unlikely to be clinically important because many clinicians and patients consider an estimate below <span class=\"nowrap\">50/50</span> a disincentive to attempt TOLAC. The nomogram was internally validated with a subset of the initial study population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and several independent retrospective cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>Although the MFMU Network prenatal care prediction nomogram is useful for identifying women who are either excellent or very poor candidates for TOLAC, it does not incorporate factors that arise later in gestation that are known to influence the probability of VBAC. While the addition of midtrimester cervical length at 18 to 24 weeks to the prenatal care prediction nomogram improved the overall predictive capability of the model based on the AUC, it did not significantly improve the clinical utility of the model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Incorporating cervical length did not significantly lower the prediction for successful TOLAC in women who went on to have an intrapartum cesarean and did not significantly raise the prediction for successful TOLAC in women who went on to have a VBAC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27829507\"><span class=\"h2\">MFMU Network calculator for use at admission for delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MFMU Network website also provides a <a href=\"https://mfmunetwork.bsc.gwu.edu/PublicBSC/MFMU/VGBirthCalc/vagbrth2.html&amp;token=URAYlIYHqEvwhQcwTE0YDFMrRX3vhx5AIrkPEuxIfeBa1klrBxRyccFcyyBpgqWdn69brtbpKw6fU7skEToxU2AaVq5VKipmU7fGtHNhmT8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=91292\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">VBAC calculator</a> at no cost that predicts the chance of VBAC based on information available at the time of admission for delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This model was developed using the same MFMU Network data described above (see <a href=\"#H27829364\" class=\"local\">'MFMU Network calculator for use at entry to prenatal care'</a> above) but replaced the prenatal weight and BMI with weight and BMI at delivery and included other factors determined at admission for delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Inclusion of these additional factors slightly improved the performance of the calculator. The overall AUC for this model was 0.77 (95% CI 0.76-0.78).

In a pilot study, a shared decision-making tool was used for counseling 25 women with a history of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The tool incorporated many of the standard risks and benefits of trial of labor versus repeat cesarean delivery, including risk of uterine rupture, other maternal morbidity, number of desired pregnancies, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The tool also incorporated an individual predicted chance of VBAC based on a Western European VBAC model established by the same group; this VBAC model has not been validated in other populations.

In the initial pilot, only 3 of the 16 women were able to define a percent chance below which they would be unwilling to consider a VBAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125519503\"><span class=\"h2\">VBAC score at admission for delivery model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author and colleagues have published a VBAC score at admission model for prediction of VBAC at the time of admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This model was developed using multivariable logistic regression in a retrospective cohort of 1170 women. Points based on weighting of the coefficients in the regression equation were used to create a VBAC score, which was based primarily on the cervical examination (Bishop score) at the time of admission, but with additional points for the presence of other variables:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VBAC score = Bishop score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65320 \">table 2</a>) + history of vaginal delivery (4 points) + prepregnancy body mass index &lt;30 (2 points) + past cesarean delivery for a nonrecurring indication (3 points) + maternal age at delivery &lt;35 years (2 points)</p><p/><p>The VBAC score is then correlated with the probability of VBAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108708 \">table 3</a>). This model was validated internally using bootstrapping and was also externally validated in a different patient cohort. The VBAC score correlated with an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.74) in the development population and 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) in the external validation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4052173763\"><span class=\"h2\">Smith model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Smith model used data from 23,286 women with one prior cesarean delivery who attempted to give birth vaginally between 1985 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-calculators-and-models-for-predicting-vaginal-birth-after-a-previous-cesarean-delivery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This population was randomly split into model development and validation groups. In the validation group, 36 percent of the women had a low predicted risk of cesarean delivery (&lt;20 percent) and 17 percent had a high predicted risk (&gt;40 percent); approximately 11 and 48 percent of these women, respectively, delivered by cesarean. The final logistic regression model was expressed as adjusted log likelihood ratios (ALLRs) to facilitate use at the bedside. The clinician can calculate the probability of cesarean for a specific patient by multiplying the odds of cesarean (background cesarean <span class=\"nowrap\">rate/1</span> - background cesarean rate) by the patient's ALLR values for height, age, previous vaginal birth <span class=\"nowrap\">(yes/no),</span> weeks of gestation (40, 41, or 42), method of induction (none, non-prostaglandin, prostaglandin), and fetal sex <span class=\"nowrap\">(male/female)</span> using a table of ALLR values for these variables provided by the authors.</p><p>In addition, the authors provided an estimate of uterine rupture: The observed incidence of uterine rupture was 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/1000</span> among women at low risk (&lt;20 percent) of cesarean delivery and 9.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> among those at high risk (&gt;40 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H487060369\"><span class=\"h2\">Model for preterm pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only one model predicts the likelihood of VBAC in women who are delivering preterm.

Factors associated with increased likelihood of VBAC were diabetes, greater cervical dilation, history of vaginal birth, and history of VBAC. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of VBAC were induction of labor, recurring indication for prior cesarean, and hypertensive disease. The overall predictive capability of the model was very good with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83).

(See <a href=\"#H27829364\" class=\"local\">'MFMU Network calculator for use at entry to prenatal care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27829507\" class=\"local\">'MFMU Network calculator for use at admission for delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the author's practice, women with a history of vaginal birth (either prior vaginal delivery or VBAC) are encouraged to undertake a TOLAC, given data that the VBAC rate has been reported to be as high as 83 percent for women with a previous vaginal delivery and 94 percent for women with a previous VBAC. (See <a href=\"#H27829536\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A VBAC calculator is useful to inform women of their individual chance of achieving a vaginal birth. This can be enlightening for women unaware that they have a good chance of safely achieving a vaginal delivery after their previous cesarean. Some observational data suggest that the morbidity of TOLAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery are equivalent when the predicted chance of vaginal delivery is &gt;60 to 70 percent. However, VBAC models have not been tested for efficacy in reducing morbidity in randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H27829536\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women are encouraged to keep an open mind regarding TOLAC, as factors only available at the time of admission improve the predictive capability of existing VBAC models to predict their likelihood of VBAC. (See <a href=\"#H27829536\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of appropriate candidates for TOLAC may allow for more cost-effective management of women with a history of cesarean delivery.
