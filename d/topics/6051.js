This topic review will discuss infectious agents that can potentially be transmitted during gastrointestinal endoscopy and outline the recommendations from various societies for the cleaning and disinfection of gastrointestinal endoscopes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71945044\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B virus has been transmitted to a single person following endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A woman, who had an endoscopy one day after a patient with known chronic hepatitis B, developed hepatitis B infection 96 days following the procedure and recovered uneventfully. Other patients who underwent endoscopy with the same endoscope three, four, and five days after the initial endoscopy did not develop hepatitis B. At the time (1980), endoscopes could not be totally immersed in fluid, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">air/water</span> channel was not specifically treated with glutaraldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Scopes have been engineered to be less complicated and are easier to clean since the 1980s. Several reports before and after 1980 suggest that with proper cleaning and disinfection, hepatitis B is adequately removed from endoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of hepatitis C, an RNA virus, during endoscopy has been demonstrated in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Transmission occurred following colonoscopy in two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and after ERCP in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The endoscope responsible for transmitting infection in the two patients infected following colonoscopy had not undergone the recommended duration of disinfection, and the biopsy forceps, the likely source of the infection, had been cleaned but not sterilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An increased prevalence of hepatitis C transmission in patients who had undergone endoscopic biopsies has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Proper disinfection of endoscopes contaminated with hepatitis C virus can effectively eliminate the risk of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In one report, there were no cases of proven transmission of hepatitis C when endoscopes were processed using current American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission by endoscopy has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Exposure to 2 percent solution of glutaraldehyde for two minutes completely inactivates the HIV virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Other approved agents also kill the HIV virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hierarchy of relative resistance to cleaning and disinfection, vegetative bacteria such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp and <em>Salmonella</em> spp are the most susceptible to disinfectants, while the mycobacteria are less susceptible and bacterial spores (from <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Clostridium difficile</em>) are the most difficult to eliminate. Although <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> are ubiquitous and have been associated most frequently with endoscopic transmission, they are both sensitive to multiple agents, including glutaraldehyde, phenols, and iodophors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Carbepenam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have been shown to be transmitted by incompletely cleaned duodenoscopes, related to the elevator region <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycobacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While mycobacteria transmission has been associated with bronchoscopy, there are no reports of mycobacteria infection following gastrointestinal endoscopy. Peracetic acid eliminates mycobacteria from bronchoscopes, colonoscopes, and endoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Simulated-use testing showed that a 6-log reduction of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> eradication is achieved from all specimens after 10 minutes of glutaraldehyde exposure at room temperature followed by an alcohol rinse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The same group demonstrated that commercially available high-level disinfectants such as Cidex (2 percent glutaraldehyde) for 20 minutes at 20&deg;C, Sporox (7.5 percent hydrogen peroxide) for 30 minutes at 20&deg;C, and Steris 20 (0.2 percent peracetic acid) for 12 minutes at 50 to 56&deg; are equally effective when used in simulated-use testing in conjunction with cleaning and in accordance with recommended guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, <em>Mycobacterium</em> <em>avium-intracellulare</em> is particularly resistant and requires extra exposure times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Helicobacter pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One study found that <em>H. pylori</em> was extremely sensitive to the usual chemicals used in high-level disinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The risk of transmission by endoscopy appears to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562522656\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In January 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that since January 2013, 69 cases of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE; including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>) had been identified in the United States, 44 of which were from northeastern Illinois [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Further investigation revealed 39 cases from one hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The source of infection was subsequently traced to the elevator channel of a single duodenoscope (the endoscopes used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]). The procedure for cleaning the duodenoscopes was carefully reviewed, and no lapses in protocol were identified. It is theorized that the complex design of the elevator mechanism makes it more difficult to clean than other parts of endoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. After changing duodenoscope reprocessing from high-level disinfection to gas sterilization with ethylene oxide, no new cases have been identified.&nbsp;Additional cases of CRE infection related to ERCP have been reported since the initial CDC report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1103614363\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations for reprocessing of duodenoscopes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization classifies saliva, gingival tissue, intestinal tissue, feces, and blood as having no detectable infectivity for prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a draft statement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that current guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting instruments were adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although prions are incredibly resistant to most methods of sterilization, no reported case of prion-related disease has been transmitted by endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study found that exposure to a temperature of 134&deg;C for 3.5 minutes was necessary for <span class=\"nowrap\">decontamination/sterilization</span> of prion-contaminated materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A properly functioning moist-heat sterilizer with adequate active air removal is required, and aldehyde use is contraindicated since it does not reliably kill prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Guanidine</a> thiocyanate solutions are highly effective against prions and may be useful in the proper settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other treatments recommended by the World Health Organization include soaking in 1N NaOH (one hour at 20&deg;C), soaking in 12.5 percent bleach (one hour at 20&deg;C), and steam sterilization in an autoclave (134 to 138&deg;C for 18 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Some endoscopy units dedicate a set of endoscopes for patients with known prion disease, although the cost of this practice is likely prohibitive and alternative diagnostic modalities (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow, use of a sheathed endoscope) should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPE REPROCESSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1968 Spaulding proposed classifying medical devices into three groups according to the risk of infection related to their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Critical devices are those that enter sterile tissue or vascular spaces (eg, biopsy forceps, papillotomy devices). These devices should be sterilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semi-critical devices are those that contact the mucous membranes (eg, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes). These devices require high-level disinfection designed to destroy all microorganisms except some bacterial spores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncritical devices only contact skin (eg, blood pressure cuffs) and need not be sterilized or subjected to high-level disinfection procedures. These items do require cleaning with low-level disinfection.</p><p/><p>Gastrointestinal endoscopes meet the definition of semi-critical devices. Thus, most organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), recommend high-level disinfection (HLD) as appropriate for these instruments. A multi-society position statement for endoscope reprocessing has been published, and the contents of this position statement are reflected in the subsequent discussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A <a href=\"http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/assets/export/userfiles/endoscope_disinfection.pdf&amp;token=8PoOYN69zZ4SisoL3AZ4w6BwZ8e2isKQmj/aCRW092BjzIj38j8vYWNAR9y1wVxZI2xhdrw67SdsLLrjb0tFrMnLXoDIXJHxsZIb9Ay7Z7yvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=2672\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> has also been issued by the World Gastroenterology Organization.</p><p>Thorough training of endoscopy unit personnel is the first critical step in endoscope cleaning and HLD or sterilization. Staff must be properly trained and must fully understand the handling of all pieces of equipment. Training manuals and competency testing are key components to staff training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/19,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,38</a>].</p><p>Endoscope reprocessing can be divided into six separate stages: precleaning, leak testing, cleaning, high-level disinfection, rinsing, and drying.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Precleaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important part of endoscope preparation is proper cleaning, which must be started promptly after procedure completion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/19,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,39,40</a>]. The most important part of this preparation is <strong>immediate</strong> washing of the exterior of the insertion tube with enzymatic detergent solution and suctioning of this solution alternating with air through the <span class=\"nowrap\">biopsy/suction</span> channel until the fluid is clear of all debris. The <span class=\"nowrap\">air/water</span> channel should be purged to clear debris from the channel. This action prevents the debris from drying on surfaces and removes large numbers of microorganisms. After these steps have been completed, the instrument is ready to be transferred to the processing area in an enclosed container [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Leak testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leak testing should be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions before submerging the scope into reprocessing solution to minimize damage to scope parts. The manufacturer's instructions should include guidelines on what to do if a leak is detected or if the scope appears to be damaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cleaning is a critical step that must be done properly prior to disinfection, whether disinfection is performed manually or by machine. When properly performed, it reduces the endoscope's mycobacterial load by &gt;4 log10 (99.99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A fresh detergent solution should be used for each endoscope to prevent cross-contamination. The detergent should be low sudsing and diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>The scope should be immersed and all debris washed from its exterior by wiping and brushing. The scope should remain immersed during the cleaning process. The suction and <span class=\"nowrap\">air/water</span> valves, the biopsy channel cover, the distal end hood (if present), and all other removable parts should be detached, while parts not intended for reuse should be discarded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Brushing should continue until there is no debris visible on the brush or the instrument. For duodenoscopes, it is important to ensure that the elevator mechanism located at the distal tip of the duodenoscope is thoroughly cleaned and free of all visible debris. The visible inspection should be done with the elevator in the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;open/raised&quot;</span> position as well as with the elevator in the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;closed/lowered&quot;</span> position to ensure there is no visible debris above or below the elevator mechanism. Consideration should be given to use of a magnifying glass (eg, 10x) to improve detection of residual debris around the elevator mechanism. &#160;</p><p>Cleaning adapters should be attached (note that elevator channels have small lumens that require manual reprocessing using a 2.5 mL syringe). Ultrasonic cleaning of reusable accessories and endoscope components can be used to remove soil and organic material from areas that are difficult to clean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Reusable brushes should be cleaned using high-level disinfectant between cases. The reusable brushes should be inspected between uses and replaced when worn, frayed, bent, or otherwise damaged. Worn bristles are ineffective for cleaning, while damaged brushes can damage endoscope channels. Some have suggested sterilizing the brushes.</p><p>All channels should be filled with detergent solution. Prolonged soaking of the channels in the cleaning solution may be beneficial if there has been a delay in initiation of the cleaning process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The scope and all reusable parts should be rinsed with clean water to remove debris and detergent. The ASGE recommends &quot;water filtered through 0.2 micron filter or otherwise treated by a method documented to improve the microbiological quality of the water&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Enzymatic detergents should be discarded after each use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The water bottle (used for cleaning the lens and for irrigation) and its connecting tube should undergo high-level disinfection or sterilization at least daily. In addition, it should be filled with sterile water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Automatic washer-disinfector</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When using an automatic washer-disinfector (AEWD), it is important to be sure that the endoscope and its components can be effectively reprocessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some parts (the elevator wire channel of duodenoscopes, for example) are not effectively disinfected by most models and require manual disinfection. The endoscope and its components must be placed into the AEWD according to the manufacturer's instructions. High-level disinfection or sterilization cannot be assured if the cycle is interrupted. Advisories from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be reviewed regularly for reports of specific AEWD deficiencies. The ASGE has published a summary of chemical germicides and automatic endoscopic reprocessors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In 2009, the FDA announced that because STERIS Corporation (STERIS) has significantly modified its SS1 processor, it no longer had FDA approval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The FDA has not approved or cleared the modified product and has not determined whether the SS1 is safe or effective for its labeled claims, including claims that it sterilizes medical devices.</p><p>The announcement from the FDA pertains to all SS1 systems, regardless of when they were manufactured or the model.</p><p>The FDA has asked healthcare facilities to take voluntary action to transition these products to legally marketed products and does not recommend that procedures be interrupted during this transition period.</p><p>The FDA made the following recommendations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an acceptable alternative to the SS1 to meet your sterilization and disinfection needs, you should transition to that alternative as soon as possible to ensure continued patient safety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you do not have an acceptable alternative to the SS1, you should promptly assess your facility's patient-care needs and sterilization and disinfection requirements and take steps to obtain legally marketed substitutes for the SS1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FDA does not recommend that facilities immediately stop using the device but that they take voluntary steps to transition to legally marketed alternatives promptly. The FDA initially expected that facilities should be able to make this transition over a three- to six-month time period, but on February 2, 2010, extended that time period to 18 months.</p><p/><p>In April 2010, the FDA cleared the STERIS System 1E (SS1E) Liquid Chemical Sterilant Processing System, which is an alternative to the SS1 processor. The FDA notes that this processor should only be used with instruments that are compatible with the S40 sterilant and the SS1E processing system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>In August 2016, the FDA ordered Custom Ultrasonics to recall all of its automated endoscope reprocessors because of an inability to validate that the machines can adequately wash and disinfect duodenoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, they can continue to be used for the reprocessing endoscopes other than duodenoscopes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">High-level disinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many chemicals approved by the FDA for use as high-level disinfectants in endoscope reprocessing, including glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/hydrogen</span> peroxide, and orthophthaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Peracetic acid is the only chemical approved for single use. The others may be reused; their strength should be tested by test strips to ensure the strengths remain above the minimum effective concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] &#160; The endoscope manufacturer's recommendations should be considered when choosing a disinfection solution since non-approved disinfection methods may void the manufacturer's warranty. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Glutaraldehyde</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two percent glutaraldehyde is the most widely used liquid chemical disinfectant. The ACG, ASGE, AGA, Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. recommend that 20 minutes at 20&deg;C is adequate to reduce bacterial levels by 6 logs if proper cleaning occurred prior to exposure to glutaraldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Peracetic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peracetic acid was introduced in the 1980s and is available in two concentrations: 0.2 and 0.35 percent. The 0.2 percent peracetic acid is designed for single use only and is used only in a dedicated processor (Steris I processor). Adequate sterilization can be achieved in 12 minutes at 50 to 55&deg;C, although the manufacturer recommends 30 minutes at 50&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. As of September 2006, the 0.2 percent acetic acid did not have an indication for high-level disinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The 0.35 percent product is not available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrogen peroxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrogen peroxide (7.5 percent) can provide the same high-level disinfection in 10 minutes at 20&deg;C as 2 percent glutaraldehyde does at 20 minutes after manual disinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the manufacturer's recommended contact time for high-level disinfection is 30 minutes at 20&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Hydrogen peroxide is not compatible with flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes manufactured by Olympus, Pentax, or Fujinon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscope-disinfection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of three chemicals listed by some endoscope manufacturers as compatible with their instruments is a combination of 0.08 percent peracetic acid with 1 percent hydrogen peroxide. High-level disinfection is achieved after 25 minutes at 20&deg;C.

Ensure that the elevator mechanism located at the distal tip of the duodenoscope is thoroughly cleaned and free of all visible debris. The visible inspection is to be done with the elevator in the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;open/raised&quot;</span> position as well as with the elevator in the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;closed/lowered&quot;</span> position to ensure there is no visible debris above or below the elevator mechanism.

This should include an alcohol flush followed by forced air drying if these procedures are compatible with the duodenoscope per the manufacturer's instructions. If channels and the elevator mechanism are not completely dry, bacterial growth can occur, forming a biofilm that is difficult to remove and could result in persistent contamination.</p><p/><p>A summary of the CDC recommendations can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/cre-duodenoscope-surveillance-protocol.html?zbrandid=439&zidType=CH&zid=9357704&zsubscriberId=93262298&zbdom=http://www.informz.net&amp;token=O/kB+TJ0T5P2ZOP3LFrsgbNILR4a6h+HQLL1a7URW6PVCSrlUa3Ny+haAaoU07J6CP+UNHu+eH7RA35/j9Ugkgu1S5ms5B92LjlufelfQMLahTIhxGQBPDJjOqLphgUq5tvGYWQcf4mI0pvGwKLtM3mI8MVbdo0XCiTDeRGQ7GZMz39S8tPvXOGfA22EbLIXbY3D1tiU1kukyOidE2oK0g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2672\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>.
