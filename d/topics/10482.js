It can be difficult to determine the exact nature of a fluid collection, and some lesions may evolve over time. The presence of a cyst or fluid collection prior to the episode of pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma suggests that the fluid collection may represent a cystic neoplasm and not a pseudocyst or WOPN. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65526084\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis of WOPN or pancreatic pseudocyst is uncertain, either because the clinical setting is unclear or when imaging findings are atypical, EUS can be performed along with sampling of the fluid collection and cyst wall. Although fine needle aspiration under CT-guidance is an alternative, the preferred route is EUS because it can assess for features that are suggestive of a cystic neoplasm (ie, mural nodules or wall thickening). </p><p>Endoscopic findings that suggest a cystic neoplasm include the presence of internal septations within the cyst cavity, echogenic mucin, or a mass lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H253464047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'EUS-FNA findings associated with specific cysts'</a>.) </p><p>The amylase level in the cyst fluid will be elevated if there is communication with the pancreatic ductal system. Thus, a high amylase concentration in the cyst fluid suggests a pseudocyst or a retention cyst, although there are case reports of an elevated amylase in patients with cystic neoplasms such as side-branch intrapapillary mucinous neoplasm. Retention cysts are small, dilated pancreatic duct side branches arising due to obstruction. Thus, an elevated amylase level alone is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis.

If such fluid collections are present, evaluation of the fluid may also help establish a diagnosis if the imaging findings (in conjunction with the clinical setting) are not diagnostic. A high amylase concentration (typically above 1000 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L)</span> in pleural fluid or ascites suggests that the fluid is pancreatic in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Cystic neoplasms treated as pseudocysts or WOPN can lead to serious complications, and substantially compromise subsequent surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Imaging with MRI can often confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasm. If the diagnosis is still in doubt despite advanced imaging, the fluid collection should be evaluated with diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H65526084\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopic ultrasound is frequently used to evaluate cystic lesions of the pancreas because it can delineate complex wall structures and internal cyst contents. Combined with fine-needle aspiration, EUS can help differentiate cystic neoplasms from pseudocyst and walled-off pancreatic necrosis. The presence of well-defined septations, echogenic mucin, or a mass lesion suggests a cystic tumor requiring resection rather than drainage alone. An elevated amylase concentration in the cystic fluid suggests a pancreatic pseudocyst but does not absolutely rule out a cystic neoplasm.

Two of the 19 patients developed infected pseudocysts that required radiologic intervention for one patient and endoscopic management with radiologic intervention for the other patient.</p><p>We obtain follow-up abdominal imaging with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging every three to six months. In patients with a definitive diagnosis of a pancreatic collection, we obtain no further imaging provided that the fluid collection either resolves or decreases in size in the absence of symptoms.

Complex collections are more likely in patients with a history of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Detection and characterization of these complex lesions is better with MRI compared with CT. (See <a href=\"#H65526010\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p>The decision to proceed with an endoscopic transmural drainage approach depends on how well-organized and defined the necrosis appears.
