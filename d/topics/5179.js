When vasculitis affects the vasa nervorum, the results are often critical ischemia to peripheral nerves and potentially profound clinical sequelae.</p><p>Vasculitic neuropathy is usually only one feature of a systemic condition that can involve the skin, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. As an example, the group of vasculitic disorders commonly associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (ie, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's], microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg-Strauss]) often cause vasculitic neuropathy. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and mixed cryoglobulinemia are also prone to involve the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>In a minority of patients with vasculitic neuropathy, the peripheral nervous system vasculitis occurs in isolation. In this setting, the disorder is referred to as nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy or isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Even in the absence of frank systemic vasculitis, nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy can be a devastating illness, leading to severe functional disabilities from which some patients never recover fully. Because the regeneration of peripheral nerves may require months or years, the goals of therapy are to control the inflammation within the vasa nervorum as quickly as possible to prevent or minimize nerve damage.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic peripheral neuropathy. The clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic evaluation of the patient with suspected vasculitic neuropathy includes a thorough medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and neurophysiologic testing with nerve conduction studies and electromyography. The gold standard for the diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy is nerve biopsy, often performed in conjunction with muscle biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough review of systems should include questions related to the other organs commonly involved by systemic vasculitis, particularly the eyes (redness, pain, visual loss); ears (hearing dysfunction, otalgia); nose (congestion, crusts, epistaxis); mouth (oral ulcers, gum inflammation); lungs (cough, hemoptysis); and skin (rash, livedo reticularis, ulcers). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough physical examination may detect findings compatible with a systemic vasculitis. Patients with vasculitic neuropathies may be unaware of focal nerve dysfunction, particularly if other organ manifestations such as arthritis, sinusitis, or skin ulcers dominate the clinical picture. Objective evidence of motor weakness, such as foot-drop, wrist-drop, or loss of deep tendon reflexes, should be sought. In the absence of diabetes, a mononeuritis multiplex is highly suggestive of vasculitis.

Patients with cryoglobulinemia and ANCA-associated vasculitides may also be ANA-positive. If the ANA titer is high (eg, &gt;1:160), further investigation is indicated to define more precisely the specific antibody responsible.

The presence of antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antigens can be seen in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome or in those with SLE.

By contrast, patients with classic polyarteritis nodosa are ANCA-negative. However, ANCA positivity alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis, particularly if directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryoglobulins and RF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In mixed cryoglobulinemia, in which the precipitate is generally comprised of monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) and polyclonal IgG components, the IgM invariably demonstrates RF activity (ie, reactivity to the Fc portion of IgG). As a result, all patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia are RF positive, often strikingly so. RF positivity is also consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrodiagnostic testing in vasculitic neuropathy is characterized by axonal damage involving multiple individual nerves in an asymmetric fashion.

Biopsy may be necessary in patients lacking these features.</p><p>Vasculitic neuropathy can be demonstrated on nerve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscle biopsy. Because the simultaneous performance of these two biopsies increases the overall yield of the procedure, adjacent nerves and muscles are usually biopsied together. Common <span class=\"nowrap\">nerve/muscle</span> biopsy combinations are the sural nerve and gastrocnemius muscle, and the peroneal nerve and peroneus brevis muscle.</p><p>In a study of 48 patients with nonsystemic (ie, isolated) vasculitic neuropathy, combined peroneal nerve and peroneus brevis muscle biopsy had a modestly higher sensitivity than nerve biopsy alone (58 versus 47 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a minority of cases, nerve biopsy is followed by chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mononeuritis multiplex has a limited differential diagnosis, which includes diabetes mellitus, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple nerve entrapments, infection (eg, Lyme disease, leprosy), and nerve infiltration (eg, sarcoid, lymphoma, leukemia).</p><p>By contrast, the differential diagnosis of symmetrical, small-fiber polyneuropathies is extensive and includes both common entities (eg, diabetic or alcoholic polyneuropathy) and rare disorders (eg, toxins). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF NONSYSTEMIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When vasculitic neuropathy is associated with an identifiable systemic vasculitis or connective tissue disease, immunosuppressive therapy is directed at the underlying disease as described elsewhere in the appropriate topic reviews. In such patients, only issues such as rehabilitation and analgesia are specific for the neuropathy. The following discussion will focus on the treatment of nonsystemic (ie, isolated) vasculitic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>A 2007 review from the Cochrane database concluded that there are no adequate randomized or quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials on which to base treatment for nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, therapeutic decisions are based primarily on clinical experience, observational data, and extrapolation from trials of immunosuppressive agents in systemic vasculitis and connective tissue diseases.</p><p>For patients with mild vasculitic neuropathy, high-dose glucocorticoids may suffice to control the disease. However, because vasculitic neuropathy signals the presence of a severe inflammatory syndrome that has major potential for both short- and long-term morbidity and death, we suggest the combined use of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> in most patients, particularly those in whom there is motor nerve dysfunction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> may be considered a reasonable alternative to cyclophosphamide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High doses of glucocorticoids are required. The choice of agent, dose, frequency, route of administration, and duration are generally selected on an empiric basis, determined in part by both the type of vasculitis and the severity of nerve dysfunction.</p><p>A widely used regimen begins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, up to a maximum daily dose of 80 mg). This regimen is continued for four weeks with ongoing assessment of the clinical response. The initial prednisone dose should not be continued beyond four weeks because of the potential for glucocorticoid-related morbidity, including muscle weakness, which may interfere with interpretation of the clinical response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Tapering regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard tapering regimen for vasculitic neuropathy, but regimens similar to the one outlined below are often used. Assuming that a patient begins <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and remains on this dose for four weeks, the following taper will require a total of 24 weeks to reach a daily dose of 5 mg:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose is tapered by 10 mg each week until a dose of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose is tapered by 5 mg each week until the dose reaches 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose is tapered by 2.5 mg each week until the dose reaches 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one week on 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose is tapered by 1 mg every two weeks until the dose reaches 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p>The patient should be monitored carefully during the tapering period by watching for signs of recurrent nerve dysfunction or the development of inflammatory disease in other organ systems.</p><p>Another important point is that new nerve infarctions can occur in distributions of extensive vascular compromise up to several weeks after the institution of effective therapy (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>). Thus, the development of a new nerve infarction shortly after starting immunosuppression does not necessarily signal the need to intensify treatment, particularly if other indicators of disease activity suggest disease control.</p><p>Continuation of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper can be considered if the patient has achieved and maintained good disease control. Tapering off prednisone completely should not proceed faster than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> decreases every two weeks. Deviations from this regimen are often necessary if patients develop glucocorticoid myopathy or experience disease flares. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe systemic vasculitis or connective tissue disease that poses an immediate threat to the patient's life, pulse glucocorticoid therapy may be indicated. No controlled clinical trials of this approach have been performed, but, in extrapolation from other clinical experience in the treatment of other inflammatory disorders, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> intravenously for three days. Following the completion of the glucocorticoid pulse, treatment with daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> may begin as outlined above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclophosphamide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> as well as glucocorticoids, particularly those with motor nerve dysfunction. The general approach is to establish disease control as quickly as possible through combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and then to discontinue cyclophosphamide after three to six months. Cyclophosphamide is replaced by a medication with a lower risk of toxicity, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.</p><p>We suggest initiating oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy at a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, with dose adjustments for patients with decreased renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The principal advantage of oral dosing of cyclophosphamide is that the daily dose can be titrated according to the white blood cell count so as to avoid neutropenia. However, the induction of remission appears equally likely regardless of whether oral (daily) or intravenous (intermittent) cyclophosphamide is used. The choice of oral versus intravenous cyclophosphamide is dictated primarily by practice style.

Patients with biopsy-proven vasculitis in other organs and presentations of nerve dysfunction typical of vasculitis do not require nerve biopsies.
