Diseases that alter the structure of the chest wall affect the function of the pump and may result in respiratory compromise or failure. The components of the chest wall include the bony structures (ribs, spine), respiratory muscles, and nerves connecting the central nervous system with the respiratory muscles. The various forces acting upon the mechanical structure of the chest wall play a major role in determining lung volume, and chest wall abnormalities can have a significant impact on lung function; in particular, chest wall pathology may be a significant contributor to restrictive physiology of the respiratory system. </p><p>Chest wall structure and physiology and diseases that affect the respiratory function of the chest wall will be reviewed here.

Clues to the effects of the chest wall on dyspnea (such as the presence of kyphoscoliosis, abdominal pathology, prior rib cage surgery, etc) are often present on physical examination but might not be elicited unless sought out and considered in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H388309349\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal structure and function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rib cage and vertebral column form the boundaries of the chest wall superiorly and laterally, while the diaphragm constitutes the inferior component. The external boundary of the lower chest wall is the lower border of the rib cage, but internally, this boundary overlaps with the diaphragm, which lies adjacent to as much as one-half of the rib cage at residual volume (RV). By virtue of this &quot;zone of apposition&quot; between the diaphragm and the ribs, the rib cage is exposed both to abdominal and pleural pressures, such that the normal function of the chest wall depends on the intricate interaction of the two spaces. The mechanics of the chest wall and its interaction with the lung are described by a pressure-volume curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81887 \">figure 1</a>). Changes in the intra-abdominal contents or compliance of the abdominal wall alter the mechanical properties of the chest wall through their effects on the motion of the diaphragm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effect of position</strong> &ndash; In the upright position, the resting volume of the chest wall is approximately 75 percent of vital capacity (VC). The rib cage recoils outward when the volume is smaller and recoils inward when the volume is larger. In contrast, the resting volume of the respiratory system as a whole, the functional residual capacity (FRC), is approximately 35 percent of VC. This measure takes into account the mechanical properties of the chest wall plus the inward recoil of the lung. Moving the chest wall from its resting position (either to make it larger or smaller) requires energy to overcome its elastic properties. The FRC, or relaxation volume of the respiratory system, represents the balance of forces of the chest wall (recoiling outward toward its resting position) and the lungs (recoiling inward toward their resting position).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The position of the chest wall curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81887 \">figure 1</a>) differs in the upright and supine positions because the abdominal contents are displaced into the thoracic cavity in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the supine position, gravity pulls the abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity (the &quot;expiratory effect&quot;), and the resting volumes are less than when erect by 15 percent of the VC. In the lateral position, the &quot;expiratory effect&quot; applies to the dependent side, such that the vital capacities may differ by 20 percent between the two lungs. As a general rule, reductions in lung volume due to upward displacement or stretch of the diaphragm resulting from increased intra-abdominal pressure lead to improved tension generation when the muscle is activated by a neurological impulse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interactions between chest wall components</strong> &ndash; The excursion of the chest wall depends upon complex interactions between its components. The motion of the ribs depends upon their attachments to the sternum and vertebral column and is influenced by the adjoining muscle groups. The parasternal and scalene muscles insert on ribs 1 through 6; the costal portion of the diaphragm inserts on the sternum and ribs 7 through 12. Flexion and extension of the spine can result in displacement of the rib cage and abdominal wall to account for as much as 50 percent of VC. The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, traverses an average of 9.5 centimeters during generation of the VC, and affects the rib cage through changes in abdominal and pleural pressures as well as through direct effects upon the ribs on which it inserts. The muscles of the abdominal wall are important muscles of expiration, and contraction of these muscles can also have a significant effect on lung volume.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4099035347\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most abnormalities of the chest wall are associated with decreased compliance (ie, increased stiffness) of the respiratory system. This results in a decrease in total lung capacity (TLC). It is difficult to generalize, however, about the effect on FRC and RV. Rather, one must consider the balance of forces described above and the new resting position of the chest wall. </p><p>Since the resting position of the chest wall for a particular condition is usually above FRC, the FRC will be increased since it is more difficult to move the chest wall from its resting position if compliance of the chest wall is also reduced. On occasion when the resting position of the chest wall is below a &quot;normal&quot; FRC, the FRC may also be reduced either because of the associated downward shift in the balance of forces or because regions of the underlying lung have become atelectatic, as in obesity and severe scoliosis. </p><p>RV will generally be elevated when the chest wall compliance is decreased (more difficult to compress the rib cage from its resting position), although the RV is preserved in very obese patients due to dynamic considerations (ie, the weight of the chest wall leads to airway compression, increased expiratory resistance, prolonged expiration, and air trapping).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717325646\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are able to perform them, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) help to determine the degree of respiratory impairment caused by a chest wall abnormality and whether other respiratory diseases are contributing to the patient's symptoms. </p><p>Testing typically includes upright spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). If respiratory muscle dysfunction is suspected, supine spirometry and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures are also obtained.</p><p>In individuals with chest wall abnormalities, PFTs usually reveal a restrictive ventilatory defect defined as a reduced TLC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59123 \">figure 2</a>). In contrast to patients with interstitial lung disease, the RV is often preserved or may be elevated. Respiratory muscle strength is preserved or mildly decreased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise capacity may be reduced, but desaturation with exercise is uncommon, contrary to what is frequently observed in patients with interstitial lung disease. However, in some conditions (eg, scoliosis, obesity), atelectasis may be present and associated with hypoxemia. </p><p>Patients with more severe restrictive ventilatory defects are at risk for hypoventilation and hypercapnia. The point at which hypercapnia develops varies among patients depending on the type of chest wall abnormality and other factors that affect chest wall compliance and respiratory muscle strength. When the VC decreases to less than 40 percent of predicted, monitoring for hypercapnia is appropriate. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3778743497\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional chest and anteroposterior spine radiographs can help identify and characterize many thoracic cage abnormalities. </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) is useful for determining the severity of pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, and selected patients with scoliosis. CT imaging is also helpful for identifying additional thoracic injuries in patients with rib fractures (flail chest), such as pulmonary contusions and associated pleural effusion. While rare, thoracoplasty can have long-term consequences on chest wall function, and CT can help determine the extent of abnormalities.</p><p>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is very sensitive for most forms of interstitial lung disease and can be used to exclude that diagnosis if the differentiation between chest wall and interstitial lung disease remains uncertain after the history, physical exam, and PFTs are complete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL AND CHILDHOOD ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several congenital abnormalities can impair chest wall function; of these, pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, and Poland syndrome are the most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pectus excavatum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pectus excavatum (also called funnel chest) is the most frequent congenital anterior chest wall deformity <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/300</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/400</span> births) and is characterized by a concave depression that may be a broad shallow defect or a narrow central pocket (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69804 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89411\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89411 \">image 1</a>). The condition affects boys more frequently than girls (3:1) and usually is discovered within the first year of life. Infants and young children generally have no symptoms, but older patients may complain of mild dyspnea on exertion and pain in the area of rib deformity after exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abnormalities on pulmonary function testing are two to three times less common than subjective pulmonary complaints, and the correlation between the two is poor.

In contrast to pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum often is not discovered until the pubertal growth spurt, such that patients often present in adolescence. As with pectus excavatum, the cause is unknown, boys are more frequently affected, and associated conditions include scoliosis and congenital heart disease. The cosmetic appearance is usually the primary concern, although some patients have exertional dyspnea, frequent respiratory infections, or asthma. Results of PFTs are typically normal, except for rare patients with associated scoliosis.

Lung compliance, which is initially normal, decreases in more severe scoliosis due to progressive atelectasis and air trapping, a consequence of breathing at low lung volumes. This reduced compliance of the entire respiratory system (chest wall and lung) increases the work of breathing. Interestingly, children with spinal deformities have normal chest wall compliance, perhaps due to their more pliant chest walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>Among patients with severe scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is decreased, approximately one-half normal in eucapnic patients and one-quarter normal in hypercapnic patients, either due to intrinsic muscle weakness or mechanical disadvantage due to the rib cage distortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>].</p><p>Despite a frequent complaint of exercise limitation among patients with scoliosis, the indices of ventilatory performance during exercise are essentially normal with the exception of reduced tidal volumes.

The decrease in FRC correlates with a reduction in expiratory reserve volume (ERV). In contrast, residual volume (RV) is relatively preserved in obese individuals older than 40 years because it is largely determined by dynamic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56,57</a>]. Specifically, elastic recoil of the lung decreases, airways increasingly narrow at low lung volumes, and airway resistance becomes a determining factor for RV.</p><p>Some authors have reported a normal vital capacity (VC) until the extremes of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], while others have proposed a decrement across a range of weights, with some suggesting a more specific correlation, such as a loss of 26 cc of VC for each kg gain in weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Airway resistance is increased in obese patients, presumably due to the increase in pleural pressure that results from the weight of the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. When airway resistance is corrected for lung volume, the difference between control and obese subjects is mitigated. Obese individuals tend to breathe at lower lung volumes than non-obese subjects and the diameter of airways is dependent on the absolute volume of the lungs. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the forced vital capacity (FVC) are reduced in obesity both in absolute terms and as a percentage of predicted values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio is usually preserved.</p><p>Chest wall compliance is mildly reduced, likely from the added pressure from chest wall and intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Lung compliance is reduced by approximately 25 percent, perhaps from increased pulmonary blood volume and early airways closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Respiratory muscle strength is generally preserved, although respiratory muscle efficiency is decreased as a result of increased mechanical work and oxygen cost of breathing. Small decrements in maximal expiratory pressure have been observed and attributed to less effective abdominal muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>An alternative hypothesis for the respiratory physiology observed in obese individuals is that breathing at abnormally low lung volumes reduces lung compliance, which in turn decreases overall respiratory compliance. A study performed in 51 anesthetized obese patients used esophageal balloons to measure pleural pressure and more directly assess lung and chest wall compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. From this study, it appeared that the reduction in lung compliance, associated with the low lung volume at FRC and possibly additional changes in the pulmonary airways and parenchyma, was primarily responsible for the low respiratory system compliance; chest wall compliance appeared normal, although the pressure-volume curve for the chest wall was displaced to the right (ie, greater pressure was required to get the chest to move, but once volume was increasing the slope of the inflation (which is compliance) was normal. &#160;</p><p>The changes in lung function noted above may be more severe when the patient moves from the upright to the supine posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/53,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,62</a>]. Patients with severe obesity can develop significant dyspnea in the supine position and often will sleep in a chair to minimize the effect of the abdomen on the compliance of the chest wall.</p><p>In addition, expiratory flow limitation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (ie, auto-PEEP) may be detected during tidal breathing in severely overweight individuals (mean BMI 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. These findings are worsened in the supine position. The presence of auto-PEEP further increases the work of breathing, which is already elevated due to reduced compliance of the lung and possibly the chest wall and increased airway resistance.</p><p>Together, chest wall and abdominal adipose tissue can decrease the resting lung volume at end-exhalation (FRC), which in turn can lead to microatelectasis. Normoxia or mild hypoxemia is usually present in the upright position, though many obese patients develop further hypoxemia as well as expiratory flow limitation when supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

Enthesitis (inflammation of the muscular or tendinous attachments to bone) of the manubriosternal symphysis and sternoclavicular joints can further reduce chest wall excursion. The degree of restrictive ventilatory defect (reduced forced vital capacity [FVC]) appears to correlate with loss of spinal mobility; functional residual capacity (FRC) and RV are normal or increased due to a higher resting position of the chest wall. (See <a href=\"#H3595191976\" class=\"local\">'Ankylosing spondylitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flail chest (ie, three or more consecutive ribs with fractures in two or more places creating a floating segment in the chest wall) can cause acute respiratory insufficiency and, in a small portion of patients managed without fixation, can be a cause of long-term restricted ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H558520254\" class=\"local\">'Flail chest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity is associated with restrictive physiology due to the increased weight of the chest wall and increased abdominal adipose tissue restricting diaphragmatic motion and causing the system to operate at low lung volumes, with consequent effects on lung tissue. Typically, TLC, FRC, and expiratory reserve volume (ERV) are reduced; RV is relatively preserved. FVC tends to be decreased in more severe obesity. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Estenne M, Yernault JC, De Troyer A.
