These categories account for the source of infertility in approximately 75 percent of couples. Infertility in the remaining 25 percent of couples is due to endometriosis (8 percent) or miscellaneous factors (eg, cervical factor, immunological factor, uterine synechiae) (2 percent) or is unexplained (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Management of couples with unexplained infertility will be reviewed here. Diagnosis and treatment of known causes of infertility are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-male-with-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the male with infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unexplained infertility refers to the absence of a definable cause for a couple's failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of attempting conception despite a thorough evaluation, or after six months in women 35 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Authorities vary in their concept of what constitutes a thorough evaluation, and these opinions have evolved over time. Currently, a thorough evaluation typically includes documentation of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubal patency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal uterine cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal semen analysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate ovarian oocyte reserve</p><p/><p>A detailed description of these tests, and the role of laparoscopy in the diagnostic evaluation, can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several possibilities have been proposed to explain why some couples fail to conceive in the absence of an identifiable cause. Subtle changes in follicle development, ovulation, and the luteal phase have been reported in some of these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In other couples, the male partner's semen analysis shows sperm concentration and motility at the lower end of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Implantation failure, subtle cervical factors, or problems with sperm and egg transport or interaction are other possibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Many cases of unexplained infertility are probably caused by the presence of multiple factors (eg, female partner over 35 years of age with diminished ovarian reserve and male partner with low normal semen parameters), each of which on their own do not significantly reduce fertility, but can reduce the pregnancy rate when combined.</p><p>Couples with unexplained infertility who are treated with IVF demonstrate reduced oocyte fertilization and embryo cleavage rates compared to couples in whom tubal factor is the cause of the infertility, although the rates of live birth per transfer are equivalent for both groups. This was illustrated in a study that showed that the oocyte fertilization and the embryo cleavage rate for unexplained and tubal factor infertility were 52 and 60 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Couples with unexplained infertility also had a higher rate of complete fertilization failure when treated with IVF than couples with tubal factor infertility (6 versus 3 percent). These results suggest that couples with unexplained infertility probably have subtle functional abnormalities in oocyte <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sperm function. In this sense, IVF is also a diagnostic procedure.</p><p>Defective endometrial receptivity is thought to prevent normal attachment, invasion, and implantation of the blastocyst, and may account for some cases of unexplained infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. No biomarkers have been validated for clinical diagnosis of these patients. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Undiagnosed/untreated</span> celiac disease may be more prevalent in women with unexplained infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of couples with unexplained infertility should balance the efficacy, cost, safety, and risks of various treatment alternatives. A common approach is to start with treatments that consume few resources and are patient-directed (eg, lifestyle changes or timed intercourse), and then move sequentially to treatments requiring proportionately greater resources (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate [CC] plus intrauterine insemination [IUI]), and finally to high-resource interventions (gonadotropin injections plus IUI, in vitro fertilization [IVF]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61307 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The approach to treatment should be individualized for each couple. In general, if a specific fertility treatment does not result in pregnancy after three cycles, alternative treatments should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle changes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optimizing natural fertility in couples planning pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Low-resource interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'High-resource interventions'</a> below.)</p><p>Once any lifestyle issues have been addressed, we begin treatment with CC and IUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As women with unexplained infertility are ovulatory, the purpose of CC is to cause mild ovarian hyperstimulation and resultant double-ovulation in normally mono-ovulatory women. CC is combined with IUI based on the hypothesis that placing a large number of sperm high in the reproductive tract enhances the likelihood of conception. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clomiphene plus IUI'</a> below.)</p><p>For women who do not conceive with <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> in three to four cycles of treatment, we proceed with IVF. IVF is the intervention that results in the highest per-cycle pregnancy rate in the shortest time interval, with up to 40 percent of cycles resulting in a live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, IVF is also the most expensive treatment option. </p><p>In women for whom IVF is <strong>not</strong> an option because of insurance, financial, religious, or personal reasons, we offer either ovulation induction with injectable gonadotropins or laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'In vitro fertilization'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin injections with or without IUI'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Section Editor and one author (MH) perform laparoscopy on women with pelvic symptoms suggestive of disease, such as endometriosis, and proceed with injectable gonadotropins for women without pelvic symptoms. For symptomatic women, treatment following laparoscopy is determined by the intraoperative findings (eg, endometriosis, adhesions). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For asymptomatic women, gonadotropin ovulation induction and IUI is offered because this approach is established in the treatment of unexplained infertility and has higher rates of conception compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> or aromatase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, patients are counseled that <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> also increases the rate of multiple gestations, including triplets and greater, compared with either CC or the aromatase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin injections with or without IUI'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One author (WG) performs laparoscopy, rather than offering <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI,</span> as the next treatment step for women unable to pursue IVF. In the author's experience, a number of these women will have findings of endometriosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesive disease at the time of laparoscopy, regardless of symptomatology, and surgical treatment of endometriosis has been associated with improved fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After laparoscopy, another course of <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> is initiated. In addition, <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> is associated with a high rate of multiple gestation and increases the cost out of proportion to the modest improvement in outcome (live birth rate 32 percent for <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> compared with 23 percent for <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the author's experience, some women who initially decline IVF and then fail other treatments will change their decision and pursue IVF rather than gonadotropin treatment because the live birth rate is higher with IVF compared with gonadotropins (45 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>] and the cost is similar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'In vitro fertilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For women with unexplained infertility who do not conceive with <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI,</span> IVF, <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI,</span> or laparoscopy, alternate treatment options include ovulation induction with the aromatase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, donor-egg pregnancy, gestational surrogacy, adoption, and cessation of treatment. It should be noted that letrozole treatment for ovulation induction is an off-label use of this medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. We believe that there is no single algorithm for women at this point in their treatment; the next steps are determined by the patient after extensive counseling by her fertility team. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Aromatase inhibitors plus IUI'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surrogate-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surrogate pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adoption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adoption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Future treatment options under development include genetic analysis of the endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and DNA micro-array analysis and next generation sequencing of the blastocyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H2087689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Genotyping microarrays'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One to 3 percent of couples with unexplained infertility followed prospectively without active treatment become pregnant each month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, effective fertility treatment for unexplained infertility must demonstrate an increase in the pregnancy rate above this baseline fecundability.</p><p>The age of the female partner influences the pregnancy rate associated with expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Women with unexplained infertility older than 37 years of age have a pregnancy rate of less than 1 percent per cycle with expectant management. In randomized trials, six months of expectant management for couples with a good prognosis for fertility (young age, no bilateral tubal disease, no sperm problems) or an intermediate prognosis (30 to 40 percent probability of pregnancy without treatment) was associated with an ongoing pregnancy rate comparable to that achieved with intrauterine insemination plus gonadotropin injections (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Thus, expectant management may be an option for a couple with unexplained infertility in whom the female partner is less than 32 years of age and there is no immediate concern about oocyte depletion. However, the ovarian oocyte pool declines rapidly for women over 37 years of age, inevitably causing ovarian aging and depletion to become a major component of the fertility problem. Thus, expectant management is not recommended for these women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT-CONTROLLED APPROACHES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological studies indicate cigarette smoking, abnormal body mass index, and excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption reduce fertility in the female partner, and possibly the male partner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optimizing natural fertility in couples planning pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Couples with unexplained infertility should be informed of a possible relationship between cigarette smoking and their infertility and advised to stop smoking for this reason, as well as for benefits in overall health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The female partner should be counseled to try to achieve a body mass index between 20 and 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2,</span> reduce caffeine intake to no more than about 250 mg daily (two cups of coffee), and reduce alcohol intake to no more than four standardized drinks per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These changes may be useful for enhancing both natural and assisted conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>This is also an appropriate time to mention lifestyle changes for health promotion to the male partner for his general health benefits, and because the couple's coordinated efforts to modify their lifestyle may provide support and reinforcement for each other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-RESOURCE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples of all ages often become frustrated with their inability to conceive. Active treatment is recommended for these couples when lifestyle interventions fail to result in pregnancy. The following interventions increase the number of gametes available in a given cycle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facilitate the ability of the gametes to interact. These interventions have less risk and cost compared with in vitro fertilization procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrauterine insemination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure consists of washing an ejaculated semen specimen to remove prostaglandins and semen proteins that would promote an allergic reaction if injected into the uterus, concentrating the sperm in a small volume of culture media, and injecting the sperm suspension directly into the upper uterine cavity using a small catheter threaded through the cervix. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedure-for-intrauterine-insemination-iui-using-processed-sperm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedure for intrauterine insemination (IUI) using processed sperm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of IUI for couples with unexplained infertility was demonstrated in a large clinical trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Over 900 infertile couples with unexplained infertility were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracervical insemination of sperm (ICI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine insemination of sperm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSH injections plus ICI</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSH injections plus IUI</p><p/><p>The purpose of the ICI was to act as a control treatment mimicking natural intercourse; the purpose of IUI was to place a large number of sperm high in the reproductive tract; and the purpose of FSH injections was to stimulate multiple follicular development and ovulation, thereby increasing the number of oocytes available for fertilization in a single cycle. Most of the women in this study had either unexplained infertility or early stage endometriosis.</p><p>The investigators observed a 2 percent per cycle pregnancy rate in the group that received the control ICI treatment; this pregnancy rate is similar to that achieved with expectant management. IUI treatment was associated with a 5 percent per cycle pregnancy rate; thus, in the randomized trial, IUI alone was effective, but only marginally for the treatment of unexplained infertility.</p><p>The pregnancy rates in the FSH-ICI and FSH-IUI groups were higher, and are described below (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin injections with or without IUI'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clomiphene citrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clomiphene</a> alone has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of infertility due to oligoanovulation or anovulation. A benefit is more difficult to demonstrate in unexplained infertility, except when the drug is paired with IUI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a 2010 meta-analysis of randomized trials of unexplained subfertility treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> versus placebo or no treatment, use of clomiphene alone (no IUI) did not increase the pregnancy rate per woman randomized (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64-1.66; 2 trials, 458 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution as there was significant heterogeneity between trials. In one trial, clomiphene citrate was associated with significantly more pregnancies over the course of four months, with a pregnancy rate of 19 percent versus no pregnancies with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A 1998 retrospective analysis of 45 published reports of treatment of unexplained infertility reported pregnancy rates of 5.6 percent with clomiphene alone versus rates of 1.3 to 4.1 percent with no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Based on these data, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) concluded that empiric use of clomiphene citrate with intercourse for unexplained infertility should be discouraged, but further studies are needed to provide better data on the effectiveness of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The ASRM Practice Committee placed significant weight on a study comparing clomiphene with expectant management and with IUI alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this study, when multifollicular development was observed with clomiphene 50 mg, the cycle was cancelled and the subject was administered 25 mg of clomiphene for 5 days or 25 mg every other day, which is a marked variance to the standard use of clomiphene. Thus, it appears that clomiphene citrate use is best paired with IUI in patients with unexplained infertility (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clomiphene plus IUI'</a> below)</p><p>The main complication of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> is an increase in the incidence of multiple gestation. This risk was illustrated in a study of 2369 clomiphene induced pregnancies that reported the incidence of twins, triplets, quadruplets, and quintuplets was 7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.13 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risk of high-order multiple pregnancies with clomiphene treatment is low, but the high volume of clomiphene cycles makes this intervention an important contributor to the total number of high-order multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In comparative treatment trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> was not as effective as gonadotropin injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin injections with or without IUI'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clomiphene plus IUI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate (CC) (to increase the rate of double ovulation) plus IUI (to place a large number of motile sperm high in the female reproductive tract) may simultaneously treat mild abnormalities of ovulation, oocyte function, and sperm function. <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> is generally the first line treatment for unexplained infertility because of its good clinical pregnancy rate, relatively low rate of multiple gestations, oral route of intake, lack of need for monitoring, and low cost. In trial of 900 women with unexplained infertility randomly assigned to treatment with CC, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, or gonadotropin (all combined with IUI), the clinical pregnancy rates were 28 (CC), 22 (letrozole), and 36 (gonadotropin) percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the rates of multiple gestation were lowest for the women treated with <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> (9 percent) compared with letrozole (13 percent) or gonadotropin (32 percent). </p><p>The optimal method for timing IUI is to use a commercial kit to determine daily urinary LH levels starting on day 10 of the cycle. IUI is performed when urinary LH is detected. This method is as effective, but less expensive, than timing based upon ultrasound monitoring of folliculogenesis with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection upon development of an appropriately sized dominant follicle, followed by IUI. This approach was supported by a systematic review showing that women who underwent hCG administration before IUI had lower clinical pregnancy rates than women who underwent IUI based upon detection of urinary LH (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. No cost analysis was performed. The authors concluded that the available data did not demonstrate a consistent, clinically important benefit of hCG-induced ovulation compared with spontaneous ovulation for IUI timing.</p><p>The question of whether two IUIs per cycle is superior to a single IUI is controversial. Some clinicians perform a single IUI the day after detection of a urinary LH surge (or 36 hours following hCG injection); others prefer two IUIs: one on the day of, and the other on the day after the LH surge, 12 to 18 hours and 36 hours after hCG injection. Several meta-analyses concluded that there is no improvement in pregnancy rate when a second IUI is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>], but two of the largest randomized clinical trials evaluating this issue in patients who received gonadotropin stimulation and IUI reached the opposite conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In the largest available trial, couples in the following subcategories had higher pregnancy rates with double IUI: ovulatory dysfunction, male factor, and use of gonadotropins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>A retrospective multicentre cohort study of couples who underwent over 15,000 IUI cycles reported acceptable pregnancy rates after one to nine cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In this series, 70 percent of the patients underwent both IUI and controlled ovarian stimulation (51 percent clomiphene-citrate, 19 percent gonadotropins). The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after three, six, and nine cycles was 18, 30, and 41 percent, respectively. Thus, this study suggests that up to nine IUI cycles is an appropriate treatment course. By comparison, older literature showed that the vast majority of pregnancies occurred by the sixth treatment cycle and relatively few occurred beyond six cycles. We typically administer three to five treatment cycles before moving on to another modality.</p><p>However, age should be taken into account; multiple treatment cycles are not beneficial in older women. One study showed that on a per patient treated basis, cumulative pregnancy rates by age were 24.2 percent under age 35, 18.5 percent ages 35 to 37, 15.1 percent ages 38 to 40, 7.4 percent ages 41 to 42, and 1.8 percent age above 42 (one pregnancy in 55 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this study, there were no pregnancies beyond the fourth cycle in women age 41 and older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Aromatase inhibitors plus IUI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian stimulation with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) plus IUI may result in pregnancy for women with unexplained infertility who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate (CC) plus IUI and who cannot or choose not to use in vitro fertilization (IVF) or gonadotropin therapy. AIs have similar clinical pregnancy, multiple gestation, and live birth rates compared with CC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,44</a>], and they are easier to use (oral dosing, no monitoring required) and less expensive compared with injectable gonadotropin therapy. Although AIs are associated with a lower clinical pregnancy rate compared with gonadotropin treatment, AIs are also associated with a lower rate of multiple gestations, including a much lower rate of triplet pregnancy. Therefore, when other treatment options do not result in pregnancy, AI treatment is a reasonable option. It should be noted that AI therapy for ovulation induction is an off-label use of this medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-letrozole\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with letrozole&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Support for this approach comes from a trial of 900 women, 18 to 40 years of age with unexplained infertility, who were randomly assigned to receive the AI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, CC, or gonadotropin for ovulation induction in addition to timed intrauterine insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The overall live birth rates were 19 percent for the letrozole group, 23 percent for the CC group, and 32 percent for the gonadotropin group. While the birth rate was highest for women receiving gonadotropin, these women also had the highest rate of multiple births, including triplets. Multiple gestations occurred in 13 percent of the gonadotropin group, 1 percent of the CC group, and 3 percent of the letrozole group. For women receiving gonadotropin treatment, approximately 30 percent of the multiple pregnancies were triplet pregnancies. In contrast, the women receiving letrozole and CC who conceived multiple gestations had only twin pregnancies; no triplet pregnancies occurred.</p><p>Lastly, theoretical concerns that aromatase inhibitors may be teratogenic have not been supported in large trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,45</a>] and a large retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the trial reviewed above, the number of infants born with congenital malformations was similar across the three treatment groups (4 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a>, 4 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a>, and 3 percent for gonadotropin) and similar to the anticipated baseline risk of major congenital malformations, which is 3 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Cumulative pregnancy rates were slightly higher in the accelerated approach group initially (p = 0.03), but were similar to those in the conventional treatment group after 11 months (p = 0.08). The incidence of multiple gestation was also similar for both groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">In vitro fertilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVF is the intervention that results in the highest per cycle pregnancy rate in the shortest time interval.

In a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized trials examining the effectiveness of IVF against other treatment options in couples with unexplained infertility, live birth rates were significantly higher with IVF than with expectant management (45.8 versus 3.7 percent; 1 trial of 51 women), but comparisons with active treatments were either not available or unable to detect moderate differences in live birth rates because the studies were small and heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a subsequent trial that randomized 154 couples with &ge;6 months of unexplained infertility and female partner aged 38 to 42 years to two cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/IUI,</span> two cycles of gonadotropin <span class=\"nowrap\">injections/IUI,</span> or immediate IVF, live birth rates were: 8, 7, and 16 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Overall, 84 percent of all pregnancies resulted from IVF. Thus, in this age group the best outcome is achieved with immediate IVF. However, an IVF cycle is several times more expensive than a <span class=\"nowrap\">clomiphene/IUI</span> or a <span class=\"nowrap\">gonadotropin/IUI</span> cycle.</p><p>The utility of a step-wise protocol was illustrated by a cohort study of couples with unexplained infertility in which the woman was initially treated with gonadotropin injections plus IUI for up to three cycles and then IVF was used to treat those who did not conceive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unexplained-infertility/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The pregnancy rate with gonadotropin injections plus IUI was 15.7 percent per cycle and 29.8 percent per patient and the pregnancy rate in those who went on to IVF was 36.7 percent.

Expectant management is a more appropriate option for couples where the female partner is young (&lt;32 years of age) than for couples with older female partners. For women &gt;37 years of age, the ovarian follicular pool can become depleted during expectant management, resulting in untreatable infertility. Women &ge;37 years old should be offered empiric treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Low-resource interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of women with unexplained infertility, we suggest three to four cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate (CC) plus intrauterine insemination (IUI) for initial therapy rather than gonadotropin injections with IUI or in vitro fertilization (IVF) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">CC/IUI</span> is generally the first-line treatment for unexplained infertility because of its good clinical pregnancy rate, relatively low rate of multiple gestations, oral route of intake, lack of need for monitoring, and low cost.

IVF results in the highest per-cycle pregnancy rate in the shortest time interval. Limitations of IVF include high cost and high rates of multiple gestations, unless single embryo transfer is used.
