Most of these agents work through mechanisms that are markedly different from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, interfering with cellular signaling and angiogenesis pathways that are needed for tumor growth. Many of these agents are associated with distinct adverse effect profiles, several of which affect the eye. Although relatively uncommon, ocular side effects from systemically administered chemotherapy (particularly targeted agents) can be severe, disabling, and irreversible. While some ocular side effects can be managed symptomatically while chemotherapy is continued, others can be vision threatening and warrant immediate discontinuation of the drug. </p><p>The ocular side effects of intraarterial chemotherapy administration (including chemotherapy administered into the ophthalmic artery for retinoblastoma) are beyond the scope of this topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-treatment-and-outcome#H3634122799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Local chemotherapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1413662672\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF THE APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH OCULAR SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient receiving chemotherapy presents with a specific ocular sign or symptom, it is important to delineate whether the complaint is due to the malignancy itself, an associated effect (eg, a paraneoplastic syndrome), or the anticancer treatment.</p><p>In general, paraneoplastic visual syndromes are rare; they include cancer-associated retinopathy, melanoma-associated retinopathy, and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (optic neuritis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-visual-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic visual syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3166578896\"><span class=\"h2\">Differentiating metastasis from drug toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common intraocular malignancy is metastatic disease, which most commonly involves the uveal tract. The uvea consists of the iris and ciliary body anteriorly, and the choroid posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Choroidal metastases typically appear as elevated amelanotic choroidal lesions with an overlying patchy disturbance of the retinal pigment epithelium.&nbsp;They are often accompanied by an overlying serous retinal detachment that appears out of proportion to the lesion itself.&nbsp;Symptoms can depend on the location of the metastasis: a peripherally located tumor with minimal serous fluid can be asymptomatic, while lesions or subretinal fluid involving the macula can result in symptoms that include photopsia (a subjective sensation of flashing lights, sparks, or colors), metamorphopsia (a condition where objects appear distorted), floaters, blurry vision, difficulty focusing, and dyschromatopsia (abnormality in the ability to perceive colors).&nbsp;While some of these symptoms can be shared with the effects of drug toxicity, a dilated fundus exam, often supplemented with ocular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, will usually distinguish choroidal metastases from drug-induced retinopathy.</p><p>There can also be metastases to the orbit or optic nerve, which can cause optic disc swelling. Disc swelling can also be seen secondary to metastases to the brain causing papilledema. Cross-sectional imaging of the head can help with diagnosis in these cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-differential-diagnosis-of-papilledema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and differential diagnosis of papilledema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Metastases to the retina can cause retinal inflammation and intraretinal hemorrhages, while metastases to the vitreous accumulate leucocytes in the vitreous humor. This can appear as vitritis (inflammation in the vitreous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>)). A dilated fundus exam and possible biopsy of the vitreous can help with differentiation between true vitritis and metastases. (See <a href=\"#H27977948\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis and ocular inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3104827064\"><span class=\"h2\">Localizing the compartment affected by ocular toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different compartments of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>) are preferentially affected by different agents. Presenting signs and symptoms can help localize which compartment of the eye (ie, the cornea, uvea [choroid, ciliary body, and iris], periocular and orbital tissue, retina, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optic nerve) is affected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cornea and anterior segment </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Cornea damage from dry eye triggers reflexive tearing; burning; gritty, sandy, or foreign body sensation; sensitivity to light; and blurred vision. The conjunctiva may be injected (diffusely red). Drug-induced conjunctivitis may present with a pinkish hue, chemosis (a collection of serous fluid within the conjunctiva that reflects conjunctival irritation), and a discharge from the eyes. Blepharitis is characterized by inflammation of the base of the eyelashes (anterior blepharitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 1</a>)) or the inner portion of the eyelid at the level of the meibomian glands (posterior blepharitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 2</a>)). Most of these patients can be managed symptomatically while chemotherapy is continued.

Inflammation of the uveal tract can present as anterior uveitis (involving the anterior ocular compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>)), intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis (involving all ocular compartments).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients suspected of having drug-induced uveitis need urgent referral to ophthalmology for examination.

These conditions are generally treated symptomatically with continued drug treatment, but sometimes ophthalmologic referral and drug discontinuation are indicated. (See <a href=\"#H27977954\" class=\"local\">'Orbit and periorbital tissue'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, orbital inflammation is associated with pain with eye movement, orbital congestion (conjunctival injection and chemosis), proptosis of the eye, exposure keratopathy, ophthalmoplegia and diplopia, potential optic neuropathy, and blindness. This is an emergency, and immediate drug discontinuation and prompt evaluation with a specialist are recommended.

The blurred vision associated with dry eyes tends to be variable, but blurriness often improves with blink.</p><p>There is no single definitive test or consensus of criteria to diagnose dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Given the lack of clinically measurable signs and available diagnostic testing, dry eye is diagnosed primarily on the basis of patient symptoms and supporting findings on the physical examination (which may include conjunctival injection, the paradoxical finding of excess tearing, and a reduced blink rate). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Lubrication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> can help symptoms. Artificial tears generally include cellulose to maintain viscosity, a spreading agent, such as polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol, to prevent evaporation, and a preservative to prevent contamination. Available without a prescription, artificial tears come in liquid, gel, and ointment form. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;, section on 'Artificial tears'</a>.). </p><p>Severe cases can sometimes be improved with a short trial of topical corticosteroids or with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (which is available as a 0.05 percent emulsion, Restasis).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes#H1212621937\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;, section on 'Topical lifitegrast'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with excess tearing caused by dry eye, punctal occlusion using temporary or permanent punctal plugs can help diminish tear outflow. These can be placed by a general ophthalmologist or a cornea specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome#H4113383405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of moderate to severe dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Punctal occlusion'</a>.)</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (retinyl palmitate) can also help, especially in cases of vitamin A deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. For severe cases, referral to a cornea specialist can be beneficial. Although dry eye symptoms can be quite uncomfortable, it is generally not vision threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795105869\"><span class=\"h3\">Blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blepharitis is a chronic eye condition characterized by inflammation of the eyelids. Anterior blepharitis is characterized by inflammation at the base of the eyelashes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 1</a>). Posterior blepharitis is characterized by inflammation of the inner portion of the eyelid at the level of the meibomian glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 2</a>) (eg, meibomian gland dysfunction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located within the tarsal plates of the eyelids. These glands are responsible for secretion of the oily layer of the tear film. This oily layer is critical for normal lubrication of the eye; it prevents tear evaporation, reduces the surface tension of the tear layer, and facilitates the spread of tears over the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Meibomian gland dysfunction and blepharitis can cause pruritus, transient blurry vision improved with blinking, a foreign body sensation, and dry eye symptoms. Exam can show crusting of eyelids and eyelid margin inflammation; oily white plugs may be visible at the meibomian gland openings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 2</a>). The two classes of agents most commonly associated with blepharitis are the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and the proteasome inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>. (See <a href=\"#H27978048\" class=\"local\">'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor'</a> below and <a href=\"#H871036471\" class=\"local\">'Bortezomib and eyelid disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Mild cases can be managed conservatively with daily lid scrubs using baby shampoo and warm water, and warm compresses. Antibiotic or combination antibiotic and steroid ointment can be used as a scrub along the lash line as well. Systemic omega-3 fatty acids can also help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Significant eyelid margin inflammation can sometimes improve with systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. Referral to a cornea specialist can help with severe cases. This condition can predispose to formation of a chalazion, a chronic inflammatory lesion that develops when a meibomian tear gland of the eyelid becomes obstructed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80892 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62030 \">picture 5</a>).

Poor healing may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects and erosions. (See <a href=\"#H27978048\" class=\"local\">'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p>The symptoms associated with nonhealing corneal epithelium are similar to those of dry eye but are more severe, especially the blurriness of vision, and burning and stinging pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, nonhealing corneal epithelium can potentially increase the risks of infectious (especially bacterial) keratitis (inflammation of the cornea of the eye). Nonhealing corneal epithelium can also increase the risk of corneal ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75303 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55332 \">picture 7</a>), which are vision threatening and need immediate attention.

We suggest that patients with corneal abrasions receive topical antibiotics to prevent superinfection, rather than no treatment. Coverage with antibiotic eye drops or ointment, a bandage contact lens, and temporary tarsorrhaphy can help to prevent ulcer formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Corneal thinning and melt are other types of epithelial defects that have been reported with EGFR inhibitors; although rare, they are potentially vision threatening, as they may lead to corneal perforation requiring corneal transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27978048\" class=\"local\">'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor'</a> below.) </p><p>Eye pain, change in vision, increased tearing, and light sensitivity are all possible symptoms. Sometimes a <span class=\"nowrap\">white/tan-colored</span> round lesion can be seen on the cornea on gross observation, which can represent an ulcer. Without a slit lamp, it may be difficult to diagnose corneal thinning or melt. It generally does not have an infiltrate, as seen with corneal ulcers. On the other hand, ulcers may not be readily apparent without a slit lamp examination either if they are small. Both conditions are potentially vision threatening and should be referred if suspected. Aggressive lubrication with preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> or ointments can be started in the interim.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2931920966\"><span class=\"h3\">Corneal deposits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal deposits, including verticillata, can be associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, the multikinase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vandetanib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy#H1825690190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Vinca alkaloids'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, a toxic optic neuropathy is seen causing reduced vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/264,265\" class=\"abstract_t\">264,265</a>]. With discontinuation of therapy, vision improvement has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/264\" class=\"abstract_t\">264</a>]. Histology showed loss of ganglion cells of the retina and atrophy of fibers of the optic nerve suggestive of direct toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-side-effects-of-systemically-administered-chemotherapy/abstract/265\" class=\"abstract_t\">265</a>].</p><p>We recommend discontinuation of therapy given the possibility of reversible cranial or optic nerve damage. However, the risks and benefits of stopping or continuing therapy should be made on an individual basis. Temporary monocular patching can relieve diplopia. If cranial nerve palsy is permanent, prism glasses or possibly surgical intervention can be tried. In the case of facial nerve palsy, frequent eye lubrication and possibly temporary tarsorrhaphy are recommended to prevent exposure keratopathy and complications. Referral to a specialist is recommended to follow these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27978392\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although relatively uncommon, ocular side effects from systemically administered chemotherapy (particularly targeted agents) can be severe, disabling, and irreversible. While some can be managed symptomatically while chemotherapy is continued, others can be vision threatening and warrant immediate discontinuation of the drug.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient receiving chemotherapy presents with a specific ocular sign or symptom, it is important to delineate whether the complaint is due to the malignancy itself, an associated effect (eg, paraneoplastic syndrome), or the anticancer treatment. Intraocular metastasis occurs most commonly in the uveal tract and can cause overlying serous retinal detachment. A dilated fundus exam, along with ocular imaging, can help differentiate a metastasis from a drug side effect. (See <a href=\"#H3166578896\" class=\"local\">'Differentiating metastasis from drug toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different compartments of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>) are preferentially affected by different agents.
