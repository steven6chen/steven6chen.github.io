Approximately one third of patients with SSc have diffuse skin involvement. Patients with diffuse skin involvement due to SSc have a greater likelihood of developing interstitial lung disease (ILD; and also cardiac and renal disease), compared with those who have limited cutaneous SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited cutaneous SSc is characterized by skin sclerosis restricted to the hands, distal extremities, and, to a lesser extent, to the face and neck.

ILD may be apparent at the time of or soon after the diagnosis of SSc or, less commonly, may develop many years after the onset of skin disease; rarely does it precede the recognition of SSc. SSc-associated ILD typically presents with the subacute onset of dyspnea on exertion and sometimes nonproductive cough. The radiographic, and pathologic features of SSc-associated ILD are typically those of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or, less commonly, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is due to diseases that localize to the small muscular pulmonary arterioles is classified as group 1 (includes idiopathic and rheumatic disease-associated); PH caused by myocardial dysfunction is group 2; and PH due to hypoxemia from advanced ILD is group 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>). SSc-associated PAH is pathologically indistinguishable from idiopathic PAH. PAH is the most common of the types of PH in SSc.

Patients with long-standing SSc are at greatest risk for developing PAH; limited cutaneous disease has long been thought to be a risk factor for PAH, particularly in association with the CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia). However, PAH also occurs in patients with diffuse cutaneous disease. Anticentromere antibodies are associated with a higher likelihood of PAH.

Patients with advanced PAH may have chest pain due to right ventricular angina, and near-syncope or syncope on exertion due to reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with PH due to ILD typically have profound dyspnea on exertion and a history of ILD. Those with PH due to left heart dysfunction may have other features of myocardial dysfunction such as peripheral edema, palpitations, or syncope.

Among patients with SSc, potential causes of a pleural effusion include pleuritis, heart failure, pericarditis (with tamponade), pneumonia, PCH-PVOD and cancer. Depending on the etiology, the presentation varies from acute onset of pleuritic chest pain (pleuritis) to progressive shortness of breath (heart failure) to an asymptomatic pleural effusion discovered on imaging or at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

As is typical for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the onset of symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain) is acute and the diagnosis is made by a chest radiograph. The management of SSc-associated spontaneous pneumothorax is determined by the size of the pneumothorax, response to initial drainage, and the type and severity of underlying lung disease.

The exact role of recurrent episodes of aspiration in lung disease in SSc is not known, but such episodes may contribute to centrilobular fibrosis and possibly worsening of SSc-associated ILD. One series described six patients with SSc and centrilobular fibrosis (ground glass or consolidative opacities in a patchy centrilobular distribution on high resolution computed tomography [HRCT]) that was associated with intrabronchial basophilic material consistent with aspirated food or medication; coexisting esophageal abnormalities were noted in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Other less common pulmonary complications include pulmonary thromboembolism, pleural effusion, spontaneous pneumothorax, airways disease, aspiration pneumonia, lung cancer, drug-induced pneumonitis, respiratory muscle weakness, and pulmonary veno-occlusive <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/pulmonary</span> capillary hemangiomatosis,. Early pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is often asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of pulmonary involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of cutaneous involvement by SSc may help predict the type of pulmonary complications. Diffuse cutaneous SSc (extensive skin involvement with extension of skin sclerosis proximal to the wrists) is more typically associated with ILD, while limited cutaneous SSc (changes confined to the fingers, distal portion of the extremities, and the face) is more likely associated with PH. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Influence of diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In view of the potentially ominous prognosis of ILD and PH and the availability of treatment, we evaluate virtually all newly diagnosed patients with SSc for ILD and PH. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for lung disease at time of SSc presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation for SSc lung disease includes a medical history (with careful attention to exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and other respiratory symptoms), physical examination, measurement of plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or BNP, pulmonary function testing (including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity [DLCO]), and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for lung disease at time of SSc presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform Doppler echocardiography in patients felt to be at greater risk for PH based on the screening evaluation (eg, low DLCO, elevated NT-pro-BNP), although other experts obtain Doppler echocardiogram as part of the initial evaluation in all patients with SSc. (See <a href=\"#H372975391\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with no evidence of lung involvement at the time of the initial evaluation remain at risk for developing ILD or PH in the future, and thus need periodic re-evaluation. We typically follow patients with SSc at three to six month intervals to assess changes in symptoms (eg, dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance) or physical examination (eg, crackles). In addition, we obtain annual pulmonary function tests (spirometry, DLCO). The timing of plasma NT-pro-BNP measurement, HRCT, and Doppler echocardiogram depends on the results of initial tests and development of clinical or laboratory abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H544415817\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSc-associated ILD is suggested by the presence of respiratory symptoms, crackles on lung examination, reduction in both lung volumes and DLCO, and ground glass or reticular opacities on HRCT. The diagnosis of SSc-associated ILD is based on the presence of the characteristic chest HRCT features of ILD (eg, ground glass or reticular opacities) in a patient with known SSc and exclusion of other causes of pulmonary parenchymal disease (eg, heart failure, recurrent aspiration, drug-induced pneumonitis). Lung biopsy is reserved for atypical cases. (See <a href=\"#H86799120\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial lung disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is suggested by exertional dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, or syncope, especially in patients with long-standing limited cutaneous scleroderma. PAH is typically associated with a reduced DLCO (&lt;60 percent predicted) that is decreased out of proportion to the lung volumes (eg, ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">FVC/DLCO</span> percent predicted &gt;1.6) or a fall in DLCO &ge;20 percent in one year. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Influence of diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, classification, risk factors, screening, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When PH is suspected on the basis of the screening evaluation and elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressures (eg, greater than 35 to 40 mmHg) on Doppler echocardiography, we proceed to right-heart catheterization (RHC). The diagnosis of PH depends on identification of an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure (greater than 25 mmHg at rest) and exclusion of left ventricular dysfunction (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [pcwp] &le;15 mmHg) and pericardial disease (equalization of average intracardiac diastolic pressures). (See <a href=\"#H86799127\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-definition-classification-risk-factors-screening-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, classification, risk factors, screening, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once PH is diagnosed by RHC, the classification of PH is determined by the presence and severity of concomitant ILD.
