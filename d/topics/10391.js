Diabetic foot ulcers are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all nontraumatic amputations performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

These observations illustrate the importance of prompt and appropriate treatment of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes. </p><p>The management of diabetic foot ulcers, including local wound care, use of mechanical offloading, treatment of infection, and indications for revascularization, are reviewed here. The evaluation of the diabetic foot and specific management of the threatened limb are reviewed separately.

Patients with diabetes also have an increased risk for nonhealing related to mechanical and cytogenic factors, as well as a high prevalence of peripheral artery disease.

Classification is based upon clinical evaluation of the extent and depth of the ulcer and the presence of infection or ischemia, which determine the nature and intensity of treatment. To assess for ischemia, all patients with diabetic foot ulcers should have ankle-brachial index and toe pressure measurements.

While similar to Wagner in its first three categories, this later system eliminated grades 4 and 5 and added stages A to D for each of the grades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The UT system was the first diabetic foot ulcer classification to be validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Grade:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0: Pre- or postulcerative (Stages A to D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70998 \">picture 1</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1: Full-thickness ulcer not involving tendon, capsule, or bone (Stages A to D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51991 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2: Tendon or capsular involvement without bone palpable (Stages A to D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87248 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87421 \">picture 4</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3: Probes to bone (Stages A to D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71315 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p/><p>Stage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A: Noninfected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B: Infected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C: Ischemic </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D: Infected and ischemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63780\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63780 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3764359\"><span class=\"h2\">Threatened limb classification: WIfI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To provide a more quantitative assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD) as a predictor and contributor to lower extremity pathology, the Society for Vascular Surgery has proposed the structure of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Wound/Ischemia/Foot</span> Infection (WIfI) system. Scores are assigned on a <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;none/mild/moderate/severe</span> basis <span class=\"nowrap\">(0/1/2/3)&quot;</span> using multiple specified criteria in the same fundamental categories as the University of Texas system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This &quot;threatened limb&quot; system includes, in particular, more detailed measures and criteria for grading vascular status. It has been validated in four separate studies and shows promise as a pragmatic means to assess the likelihood of morbidity in at-risk limbs. The classification can be visualized as three intersecting rings of risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103041\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103041 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The quantitative scores for these individual categories can help identify the relative importance of the various factors underlying risk to a limb at a given point in time. In applying the WIfI system, it is recommended that diabetic and nondiabetic patients be considered in separate categories and the presence or absence of neuropathy be additionally noted in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While the specifics of what constitutes &quot;none, mild, moderate, and severe&quot; may change over time, the basic principles are likely to prove durable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H465130934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'WIfI (Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection)'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3764475\"><span class=\"h2\">Wagner, PEDIS, and others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An early and often still used classification system at hyperbaric-based wound healing centers was originally proposed by Wagner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This classification was based upon clinical evaluation (depth of ulcer and presence of necrosis) alone and did not account for variability in the vascular status of the foot. The Wagner system is predictive of poor outcome, but only up to grade 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It has fallen out of widespread use because of the lack of specificity to describe coexistent depth, infection, and ischemia.

The PEDIS system is primarily used for research purposes. Other ulcer classification systems have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245375590\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our management approach is consistent with multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of the diabetic foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Most patients with diabetes over age 40 should be offered measures to reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Reducing the risk of macrovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3765716\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of diabetic foot ulcers begins with a comprehensive assessment of the ulcer and the patient's overall medical condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103017\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103017 \">algorithm 1</a>). Evidence of infection, underlying neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, edema, malnutrition, and any bony deformities should be actively sought and addressed systematically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The incidence of neuropathic (Charcot) arthropathy may be as high as 13 percent in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For patients with evidence of arterial insufficiency, we suggest referral to a vascular specialist.</p><p>While it stands to reason that effective glucose control and adequate nutrition are important in healing diabetic foot wounds, there are few data to support either assumption. There are no randomized trials data to support that glucose control affects healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A trial evaluating the effectiveness of liquid oral protein supplementation failed to show a difference in healing between main groups but reported a significantly greater likelihood of healing in a subset of patients with low albumin or ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Local ulcer care includes sharp debridement and proper wound coverage. When debridement is needed, we suggest surgical (sharp) debridement. Dressings are selected based upon ulcer appearance and other wound characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60931 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893 \">table 2</a>). For extensive open wounds following debridement for infection and necrosis, or following partial foot amputation, we suggest negative pressure wound therapy, provided there is no residual necrotic tissue or infected bone (osteomyelitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Local care'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dressings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H245376946\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Any ulcer that is subjected to sustained or frequent pressure and stress (ie, pressure-related heel ulcers or <span class=\"nowrap\">medial/lateral</span> foot ulcers) or repetitive moderate pressure (plantar foot ulcers) will benefit from pressure reduction, which is accomplished with mechanical offloading. Several methods are available to achieve mechanical offloading, including total contact casts, cast walkers, wedge shoes, and bedrest. Following surgery, total contact casting and cast walkers are better alternatives to prolonged bed rest for the relief of pressure as they allow for the benefits and convenience of continued ambulation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical offloading'</a> below.)</p><p>For some patients, successful offloading of a diabetic ulcer cannot be adequately achieved by mechanical devices alone. In such cases, surgical correction of the deformity may be required. Interventions include hammertoe corrections, bunion corrections, Achilles tendon or gastrocnemius lengthening, and Charcot foot reconstructions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathic-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic neuropathic arthropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whether such management can be accomplished in an outpatient setting and when admission to hospital is needed depends upon the skill set of the local wound care team, the resources available, and the personality and life circumstances of the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3767049\"><span class=\"h3\">Allowable time course for primary healing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, measurements of a patient's ulcer size should be taken at every visit so that comparisons can be made and progress documented. The surface area of a diabetic foot ulcer should decrease in size at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 percent a day. Thus, appropriate local wound care should achieve a greater than 40 to 50 percent surface area reduction or reduction of ulcer depth by four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If this rate of progress is <strong>not</strong> observed, in our system, the patient's care is transferred from the local team to a wound consultant who works with the patient's primary care physician to address issues such as glycemic control, edema, and other aspects of general health and nutrition. Ulcers that still do not improve should be reevaluated for ongoing soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis, impaired extremity vascular flow, and, most commonly, the need for more effective offloading or surgical debridement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3767080\"><span class=\"h3\">Coordination of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coordination among care providers is important for keeping rates of amputation as low as possible. This was illustrated in a study of 10 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers in which decreased rates of amputation were seen in programs with the highest scores for availability of clinical protocols, educational seminars, discharge planning, and quality of care meetings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At our institution, certified wound consultants are responsible for training and certifying local teams of nurses in each primary care clinic to use and follow a standard protocol (evidence-based where possible) for evaluation and care of diabetic foot ulcers. The ulcer is classified upon initial presentation and with each follow-up visit, and we ensure consistent documentation within the electronic medical record using a standardized approach to measuring the length, width, and depth of each wound at every visit regardless of where the patient is receiving wound care within our system (ie, family practice outpatient clinic, surgical clinic, nursing facility, home nursing services). Patients are seen at least once a week and sometimes more often, initially, to follow the progress of healing and to plan further treatment. For facilities that do not have the resources to implement such a systematic approach to care, referral to a facility with appropriate expertise in the management of diabetic foot problems (medical and surgical) is appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3767100\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up care and ulcer prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a patient has healed an ulcer, he or she remains at a very high risk for reulceration. Once healed, ulcer recurrence is 40 percent at one year, 66 percent at three years, and up to 75 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Therefore, people with healed ulcers should be considered &quot;in remission,&quot; a term that better communicates the lifetime of visits (often bimonthly) needed to reduce the risk for severe recurrence, if not all ulcer recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/1,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,30</a>]. The goals of long-term surveillance and care are to maximize ulcer-free, hospital-free, and activity-rich days. </p><p>Ongoing counseling regarding preventive foot care should be given to any patient whose feet are at risk for further ulcer development, particularly patients with existing neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87587\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87587 \">table 3</a>). Several measures can markedly diminish ulcer formation, such as avoiding poorly fitting shoes, not walking barefoot, and stopping smoking.

When a clinician with expertise in sharp debridement is not available, autolytic hydrogels can be used. For noninfected ulcers that extend to deeper tissues <span class=\"nowrap\">(grade/stage:</span> 2A, 3A), we suggest initial surgical debridement in an operating room setting. For pressure-related ulcers, mechanical offloading should be implemented.

The antibiotics chosen and duration of therapy depend upon the depth and severity of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Consultation with a surgeon is important for any infection that extends beyond the dermis.

In addition to proper local care (debridement, wound coverage, relief of pressure), patients with significant limb ischemia should be referred to a vascular specialist for possible revascularization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103017\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103017 \">algorithm 1</a>). Revascularization (open, endovascular) should be considered in patients with any degree of limb ischemia and foot ulcer that does not improve over an appropriate time course.

The frequency of assessment and proper care may contribute more to wound healing than the type of debridement. In a review that examined chronic wound care among veterans, the chance of diabetic ulcer healing increased 2.5-fold when debridement was performed at 80 percent of visits and doubled when ischemia was assessed at the first visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>There are few data to guide choice of debridement (sharp, enzymatic, autolytic, mechanical, and biological) for diabetic foot ulcer. The types of debridement are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound debridement'</a>.) </p><p>When surgeons with expertise in sharp debridement are available, we prefer this method. Sharp debridement, the most widely used method, involves the use of a scalpel or scissors to remove necrotic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As an alternative, we suggest application of a hydrogel, but data are limited to support its efficacy in promoting ulcer healing. Enzymatic debridement (topical application of proteolytic enzymes such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collagenase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">collagenase</a>) may be more appropriate in certain settings (eg, extensive vascular disease not under team management) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Offloading devices include total contact casts, cast walkers, shoe modifications, and other devices to assist in ambulation. Although nonremovable pressure-relieving treatments improve healing, in clinical practice, the type of offloading that is used depends largely on local resources such as whether there is a surgeon who is skilled at contact casting, or a practitioner (eg, podiatrist) who can fit the patient with customized footwear. In the absence of such expertise, a removable cast walker may be the best option.</p><p>Evidence from randomized trials supports the use of total contact casts and nonremovable cast walkers for relief of pressure to improve healing of diabetic foot ulcers. A 2000 Cochrane review updated in 2013 evaluated 14 trials comparing various forms of pressure-relieving treatments (nonremovable, removable) and dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. In five trials, the likelihood of wound healing was significantly better at 12 weeks for nonremovable, pressure-relieving casts compared with removable devices or dressings (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.36).

Disadvantages of total contact casting include expertise needed in applying the cast, inability to inspect the foot frequently, inconvenience in activities of daily living (eg, bathing), and the risk of developing a secondary ulcer in an ill-fitting cast (particularly in patients with neuropathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Frequent cast changes may be needed to avoid complications. Total contact casts should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with infected ulcers or wounds, osteomyelitis, peripheral ischemia (ankle-brachial index &lt;0.6), bilateral ulceration, lower extremity amputation, or heel ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Based upon randomized trials, total contact casting enhances diabetic ulcer healing and is the standard for relieving pressure from the forefoot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/101,102,104-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102,104-110</a>].

The ankle-brachial index is a measurement of the ratio of blood pressure at the ankle to that in the brachial artery that correlates with the presence and severity of arterial occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. In patients with diabetes, the blood vessels may be incompressible and ankle-brachial index values misleading. Segmental volume plethysmography and toe-brachial index values are more reliable for determining the severity of disease. The noninvasive diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ankle-brachial index'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58549539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Toe-brachial index'</a>.)</p><p>Revascularization plays an important role in the management of diabetic foot ulcers in patients with documented peripheral artery disease (to avoid the need for amputation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When achievable, revascularization is associated with a lower incidence of amputation in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer and severe limb ischemia. As an example, in a longitudinal study of 564 patients, angioplasty or bypass grafting was performed in 75 and 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Neither procedure was possible in the remaining 5 percent. The amputation rates were 8.2, 21.2, and 59.2 percent among patients who underwent angioplasty, bypass, or no revascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3148454879\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

Evidence of underlying neuropathy, bony deformity, and peripheral artery disease should be actively sought. The ulcer is classified upon initial presentation and with each follow-up visit using a standardized system to document the examination and treatment plan, and to follow the progress of healing. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Ulcer classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate debridement, proper local wound care (debridement and dressings), redistribution of pressure on the ulcer by mechanical offloading, and control of infection and ischemia (when present) are important components of treatment for all ulcers, regardless of stage and depth. (See <a href=\"#H245375590\" class=\"local\">'Management overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with diabetic foot ulcers, we suggest surgical (sharp) debridement rather than another method (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If a surgeon with clinical expertise in sharp debridement is not available, we suggest autolytic debridement with hydrogels (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatively, the patient can be referred to a facility with appropriate surgical expertise in the management of diabetic foot problems. Dressings are selected based upon ulcer or postsurgical wound characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Debridement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dressings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For managing extensive open wounds following debridement for infection or necrosis, or partial foot amputation, we suggest negative pressure wound therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). All necrotic tissue or infected bone (osteomyelitis) first must be removed from the wound. (See <a href=\"#H245376946\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several methods are available to achieve mechanical offloading and include total contact casts, cast walkers, wedge shoes, and bedrest. The type of offloading that is used depends largely on local expertise. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical offloading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with a diabetic foot ulcer and severe limb ischemia, we recommend early revascularization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Revascularization should also be performed in patients with a nonhealing ulcer and any degree of limb ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H3767049\" class=\"local\">'Allowable time course for primary healing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1284597\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia and revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a patient has healed an ulcer, he or she remains at a very high risk for reulceration. Therefore, people with healed ulcers should be considered &quot;in remission,&quot; a term that better communicates the lifetime of visits (often bimonthly) needed to reduce the risk of recurrence. The goals of long-term surveillance and care are to maximize ulcer-free, hospital-free, and activity-rich days. (See <a href=\"#H3767100\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care and ulcer prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Boulton AJ, Armstrong DG, Albert SF, et al.
