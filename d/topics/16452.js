It happens when a small gland on the edge of the eyelid gets infected or inflamed. Styes can occur on the upper or lower eyelids. Most styes get better on their own after a few days to a week. Another word for stye is &quot;hordeolum.&quot;</p><p>People sometimes get a stye confused with a different eye problem called a &quot;chalazion.&quot; A chalazion also causes a lump on the eyelid. But a stye is caused by an infection and is painful. A chalazion is not tender or painful, but it often lasts longer than a stye does.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578460\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a stye?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have a stye have a red and painful lump on the edge of their eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81682\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81682 \">picture 1</a>). A stye usually develops over a few days. It can look like a pimple. Styes can cause other symptoms, too, such as tearing and eyelid pain and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578467\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a stye?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a stye by talking with you and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578474\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To ease your symptoms and help your stye get better, you can put a warm, wet compress on the stye. Wet a clean washcloth with warm water and put it over your stye. When the washcloth cools, reheat it with warm water and put it back over the stye. Repeat these steps for 5 to 15 minutes, and try to do this 3 to 4 times a day.</p><p>You should <strong>not</strong> squeeze or pop your stye. Also, you should not wear eye makeup or contact lenses until your stye is all better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578481\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stye doesn't go away after you treat it on your own for 1 week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stye gets very big, bleeds, or affects your vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your whole eye is red, or your whole eyelid is red and swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The redness or swelling spreads to your cheek or other parts of your face</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578488\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments might my doctor use?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your stye doesn't get better or if it leads to other problems, your doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribe a cream or ointment that goes in the eye and on the eyelid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribe antibiotic medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drain the stye</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578495\"><span class=\"h1\">Can styes be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes.
