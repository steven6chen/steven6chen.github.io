There are 2 main types of granuloma annulare:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized &ndash; The rash affects only 1 part of the body. This type of granuloma annulare is much more common.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized &ndash; The rash affects more than 1 part of the body. This type of granuloma annulare is less common.</p><p/><p>This condition can last for a while. Most of the time, the localized type of granuloma annulare goes away by itself within 2 years.</p><p>Granuloma annulare can happen in children and adults. Doctors don't know what causes it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589342614\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of granuloma annulare?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the type of granuloma annulare.</p><p>Localized granuloma annulare most commonly causes 1 or more circle-shaped areas of red, raised skin that are not scaly. The center of the area is usually skin-colored (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87100 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87101\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87101 \">picture 2</a>). Localized granuloma annulare usually affects the wrists, ankles, backs of the hands, and tops of the feet. It is not usually itchy.</p><p>Generalized granuloma annulare can cause different types of rashes and skin symptoms. Most commonly, it causes many red, raised, circle- or arc-shaped areas on different parts of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87099\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87099 \">picture 3</a>). This rash is sometimes itchy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589342629\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not always. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell if you have this condition by doing an exam and looking at your rash.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse is not sure whether you have granuloma annulare, he or she might scrape your skin and look at the scrapings under a microscope. This test helps tell whether you have an infection that can look like granuloma annulare.</p><p>Some people have a test called a skin biopsy. For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of skin from the rash. Then another doctor looks at it under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589342644\"><span class=\"h1\">How is granuloma annulare treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of granuloma annulare you have and how bothersome your symptoms are.</p><p>If your rash is not itchy or bothersome, you probably do not need treatment. Your rash will most likely go away by itself over time.</p><p>If your symptoms bother you, there are different treatments that might help.</p><p>Treatment for localized granuloma annulare can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid ointments or creams that go on the rash &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These medicines help reduce inflammation and itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shots of steroid medicines that go into the rash</p><p/><p>Treatment for generalized granuloma annulare can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid ointments or creams that go on the rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light therapy &ndash; For this treatment, your doctor will use a machine that gives off a special type of light.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589342659\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my rash return?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, the rash returns after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589342674\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
