The organism classically responsible for the enteric fever syndrome is <em>Salmonella</em> <em>enterica</em> serotype Typhi (formerly <em>S</em>. <em>typhi</em>). Other <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes, particularly <em>S. enterica</em> serotypes Paratyphi A, B, or C, can cause a similar syndrome; however, it is usually not clinically useful or possible to reliably predict the causative organism based on clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The term &quot;enteric fever&quot; is a collective term that refers to both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, and &quot;typhoid&quot; and &quot;enteric fever&quot; are often used interchangeably.</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of enteric fever will be reviewed here.

Worldwide, enteric fever is most prevalent in impoverished areas that are overcrowded with poor access to sanitation. Incidence estimates suggest that south-central Asia, Southeast Asia, and southern Africa are regions with high incidence of <em>S</em>. Typhi infection (more than 100 cases per 100,000 person years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Other regions of Asia and Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Oceania have a medium incidence of 10 to 100 cases per 100,000 person years. These estimates, though, are limited by lack of consistent reporting from all areas of the world and are based on extrapolation of data across regions and age groups. More recent population-based studies from Latin America, in particular, are lacking, and surveillance suggests that rates have declined substantially over the past 30 years. Furthermore, subsequent data from Africa have revealed substantial heterogeneity between countries, with some Southern and Northern African countries having very low rates (&lt;5 cases per 100,000 person years) while several countries in Eastern and West Africa have rates &gt;100 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>S. </em>Paratyphi A remains uncommon in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but accounts for a substantial proportion of enteric fever cases in areas of South Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Because humans are the only reservoir for <em>S.</em> Typhi, a history of travel to settings in which sanitation is poor or contact with a known typhoid case or carrier is useful for identifying people at risk of infection outside of endemic areas, although a specific source or contact is identified in a minority of cases. Transmission from an index case to a contact is rarely documented in resource-rich settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 200 to 300 cases of <em>S.</em> Typhi are reported in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. About 80 percent of these cases occur among travelers to countries where enteric fever is endemic, particularly countries in South-Central Asia, but domestic acquisition still occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a study of 428 cases of enteric fever reported among travelers from resource-rich countries through the multinational GeoSentinel Surveillance Network between 2006 and 2011, 67 percent of cases were acquired in south-central Asia (34, 13, 7, and 6 percent of total from India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90927 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Individuals visiting relatives in endemic countries accounted for 28 percent of the typhoid cases.</p><p>Many travelers who subsequently develop enteric fever have not received appropriate vaccination despite guideline recommendations. Among 580 cases of vaccine-preventable diseases among returned international travelers reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network between 1997 and 2007, confirmed or probable enteric fever (due mainly to <em>S</em>. Typhi, but also <em>S</em>. Paratyphi) was the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Only 38 percent of those with enteric fever had a pre-travel clinical encounter. However, the possibility of <em>S</em>. Typhi infection in returning travelers with a history of vaccine receipt should not be discounted, since the vaccine is not completely effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;, section on 'Typhoid vaccine'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who acquire infection abroad are usually older than those who acquire disease in United States outbreaks and are more likely to have drug-resistant infection. <em>S</em>. Typhi outbreaks in the United States are most often foodborne; they are generally limited in size but can cause substantial morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. </p><p>The risk factors for the development of enteric fever due to <em>S. </em>Typhi or <em>S. </em>Paratyphi may differ. In an Indonesian study, transmission of paratyphoid fever was more frequently observed outside the home (eg, via consumption of food purchased from street vendors); transmission of typhoid fever was more frequently observed within the household (eg, via sharing utensils, presence of a patient with typhoid, lack of soap or adequate toilet facilities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some evidence suggests that <em>S. </em>Paratyphi may be more likely to be transmitted by food, while <em>S. </em>Typhi may spread more via contaminated water supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], though this remains to be confirmed. <em>S</em>. Paratyphi also appears to be an increasing cause of enteric fever among vaccinated travelers, as the Vi polysaccharide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=typhoid-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">typhoid vaccine</a> is ineffective against most <em>S</em>. Paratyphi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], which lack the Vi antigen targeted by the vaccine. Vaccines for <em>S</em>. Typhi induce detectable immune responses to <em>S</em>. Paratyphi in vitro, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. There are mixed field data concerning the protection of the oral Ty21a against <em>S. </em>Paratyphi infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Issues related to the epidemiology of drug resistance are discussed separately.

Chronic carriage in the urine is rare and almost always associated with an abnormality in the urinary tract (eg, urolithiasis, prostatic hyperplasia) or concurrent bladder infection with Schistosoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Chronic carriers represent an infectious risk to others, particularly in the setting of food preparation. The story of &quot;Typhoid Mary,&quot; a cook in early 20th century New York who infected approximately 50 people (three fatally), highlights the role of asymptomatic carriers in maintaining the cycle of person-to-person spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Infection therefore implies direct contact with an infected individual or indirect contact via contaminated food or water. </p><p>Infection due to <em>S.</em> Paratyphi species (also called <em>Salmonella</em> <em>enteritidis</em> serotype Paratyphi in older reports) is less common than infection due to <em>S</em>. <em>enterica</em> serotype Typhi. Regional variation in prevalence of <em>S</em>. Paratyphi species has been described; <em>S</em>. Paratyphi A is commonly identified as a cause of enteric fever in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <em>S</em>.

In a study of 809 patients suspected of having enteric fever in Nigeria, for example, nontyphoidal Salmonellae (most commonly <em>S</em>. <em>enteritidis</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> <em>typhimurium</em>) were isolated in 7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In Africa, bacteremia with nontyphoidal Salmonellae is often associated with underlying HIV infection, which should be considered in such patients.

The organisms classically responsible for the enteric fever syndrome are <em>Salmonella</em> <em>enterica</em> serotypes Typhi (formerly <em>S</em>. <em>typhi</em>) and Paratyphi A, B, and C. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic settings, enteric fever is more common in children and young adults than in older patients. Humans are the only reservoir for <em>S</em>. <em>enterica</em> serotype Typhi. In resource-rich settings, most cases of enteric fever occur in patients who have traveled to endemic regions, particularly south-central Asia. A history of travel to settings in which sanitation is poor or history of contact with a known typhoid case or carrier is useful for identifying patients at risk of infection, although a specific contact is identified in a minority of cases.

Rates of chronic carriage after <em>S</em>. Typhi infection range from 1 to 6 percent. Chronic carriage occurs more frequently in women and in patients with cholelithiasis or other biliary tract abnormalities. Chronic carriers represent an infectious risk to others, particularly in the setting of food preparation.

Classic manifestations include relative bradycardia, pulse-temperature dissociation, and &quot;rose spots&quot; (faint salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen). Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation may occur, leading to secondary bacteremia and peritonitis. Laboratory findings may include anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteric fever should be suspected in a febrile patient living in, traveling from, or visiting from an endemic area, particularly if the duration of fever is more than three days or if the patient also has gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of enteric fever is made by culture of the causative microorganism in the setting of a compatible clinical illness.
