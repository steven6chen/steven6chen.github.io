We use high-dose PPIs for a period of up to eight weeks for treatment for acid reflux (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a> 20 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> 30 mg twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In patients whose symptoms resolve, the PPI dose can subsequently be lowered to the lowest effective dose to control recurrent symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H3390834743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Recurrent symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>A response to a trial with PPIs is often used to implicate reflux as the cause of noncardiac chest pain. Two meta-analyses have estimated the accuracy of this approach compared with esophageal pH testing or endoscopy as the reference standard, both concluding that a clinical response to a trial of a PPI performs fairly well as a diagnostic test for identifying pathologic reflux in patients with noncardiac chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. However, a potential problem with these conclusions is the way in which endpoints were defined in the individual trials. A 50 percent decrease in pain is much less specific than complete pain relief; thus, the estimates of specificity may be optimistic. Furthermore, patients included in the primary studies were generally referred to tertiary care centers and had undergone a thorough evaluation for other causes of pain. Whether similar accuracy would be observed in a less selected group of patients with presumed noncardiac chest pain is unclear. An earlier meta-analysis found that a response to a PPI was not an accurate predictor of GERD when GERD was defined by endoscopy or pH studies, but primary studies of patients with noncardiac chest pain were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>The cost-effectiveness of PPI treatment was supported in a decision analysis in which strategies using initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> were associated with an 11 percent improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a 43 percent reduction in the use of invasive diagnostic tests compared with traditional diagnostic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It was estimated that PPI treatment could yield a cost savings of $454 per patient compared with a strategy of beginning with endoscopy and proceeding with pH monitoring and manometry. However, this argument is weakened by the knowledge that endoscopy is not an important component of the initial diagnostic approach to these patients because of its low yield. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115965184\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who fail to respond to a trial with PPIs fall into the following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with continued acid secretion.

Approximately 50 percent of patients with recurrent noncardiac chest pain have abnormal esophageal acid exposure. Other causes of chest pain of esophageal origin include an esophageal motility disorder, non-reflux esophagitis (eg, infectious or medication induced), eosinophilic esophagitis, and functional chest pain of presumed esophageal origin. (See <a href=\"#H375123931\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H375123165\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal chest pain can result from the stimulation of chemoreceptors by acid or hyperosmolar substances, mechanoreceptors by distension or abnormal contractions, and thermoreceptors by hot or cold food. Esophageal chest pain may also result from abnormal perception of otherwise normal stimuli due to a decreased pain threshold (ie, esophageal hypersensitivity) or the abnormal transmission of stimuli in the peripheral and central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H375121955\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial assessment of patients with chest pain should focus on the exclusion of life-threatening conditions and acute coronary syndrome. Although the clinical presentation often does not provide adequate clues to distinguish cardiac from esophageal pain, some symptoms that are suggestive but not specific of an esophageal etiology include the presence of associated esophageal symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia) and relief with antacid or antisecretory agent (eg, histamine 2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) ingestion. A detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory studies are also necessary to narrow the differential diagnosis and to identify patients with alarm features including dysphagia, odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H491857552\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to and extent of diagnostic evaluation in a patient with chest pain of esophageal origin is based on the presence or absence of alarm features:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with alarm features should undergo an early upper endoscopy, preferably within two weeks. Patients with alarm features in whom the early upper endoscopy is negative are subsequently managed similarly to patients without alarm features.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients without alarm features should be treated with an empiric trial of PPIs for eight weeks. Further evaluation with both esophageal impedance and pH monitoring and esophageal manometry should be pursued in these patients if they fail to respond to PPIs. In the absence of alarm features, we reserve upper endoscopy for patients in whom <span class=\"nowrap\">impedance/pH</span> and manometry testing are unrevealing. (See <a href=\"#H24735254\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic strategies and initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with continued symptoms of chest pain or discomfort that is not of burning quality for three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis, and no evidence of GERD or a histopathology-based motility disorder such as achalasia to explain the symptoms, should be diagnosed and treated as functional chest pain.
