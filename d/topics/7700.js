Inherited and acquired processes resulting in excess methemoglobin will be described here. The diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">METHEMOGLOBIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methemoglobin is an altered state of hemoglobin in which the ferrous (Fe<sup>++</sup>) irons of heme are oxidized to the ferric (Fe<sup>+++</sup>) state. The ferric hemes of methemoglobin are <strong>unable</strong> to bind oxygen. In addition, the oxygen affinity of any accompanying ferrous hemes in the hemoglobin tetramer is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; as a result, the oxygen dissociation curve is &quot;left-shifted&quot; and oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Thus, the patient with increased concentrations of methemoglobin has a functional anemia, to the extent that the circulating methemoglobin-containing molecules are unable to carry oxygen, and the remaining hemoglobin, because of its increased oxygen affinity, has a decreased ability to deliver oxygen to the tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the formation of oxyhemoglobin from deoxyhemoglobin and molecular oxygen, one electron is partially transferred from heme iron to the bound oxygen, forming a ferric-superoxide anion complex (Fe3+&mdash;O2-) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During deoxygenation, most of the oxygen leaves the molecule as molecular oxygen, but a small amount leaves as a superoxide (O2-) radical. Under the latter circumstance, the partially transferred electron is not returned to the iron moiety, leaving the heme iron in the ferric state (ie, methemoglobin). This autooxidation of hemoglobin occurs spontaneously at a slow rate in normal individuals, converting 0.5 to 3 percent of the available hemoglobin to methemoglobin per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Methemoglobin is also formed from the oxidation of hemoglobin heme iron via reactions with free radicals and endogenous compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), O2-, and hydroxyl radical (OH&bull;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Exogenous compounds may oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin directly, by means of a metabolic derivative or by generating O2- and H2O2 during their metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once formed, methemoglobin can be reduced back to hemoglobin either enzymatically or nonenzymatically via a number of pathways, only one of which is physiologically important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53599 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytochrome b5 reductase pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only physiologically important pathway for reducing methemoglobin back to hemoglobin is the NADH-dependent reaction catalyzed by cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R). Cytochrome b5R, previously known as diaphorase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and also as methemoglobin reductase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], contains a noncovalently bound prosthetic FAD group that acts as an electron acceptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. NADH generated from glycolysis reduces FAD to FADH2, which then reduces the heme protein cytochrome b5. Electrons from the reduced cytochrome b5 are in turn transferred to methemoglobin, reducing iron back to the ferrous state (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53599 \">figure 2</a>). The genetics, function, and deficiency of this protein are described in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">NADPH-methemoglobin reductase pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative, pathway for reduction of methemoglobin is mediated by NADPH-(flavin) methemoglobin reductase. This pathway uses NADPH generated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the hexose monophosphate (pentose phosphate) shunt as a source of electrons. However, there is normally no electron carrier present in red blood cells to interact with NADPH. As a result, electron acceptors or redox dyes, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, and riboflavin&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53599 \">figure 2</a>) can activate this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Since these electron acceptors are not physiologic, this electron transfer is not significant under normal conditions and NADPH methemoglobin reductase deficiency does not cause methemoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene blue</a> administered in the treatment of methemoglobinemia serves as an exogenous electron acceptor, bypassing congenital blocks in the cytochrome b5 reductase pathway, or correcting an acute toxic methemoglobinemia that overwhelms the reducing power of cytochrome b5 reductase. However, in individuals with G6PD deficiency, the use of methylene blue is potentially dangerous since it is a compound with oxidant potential and may produce hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Antioxidant protein 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A balance to methemoglobin formation is antioxidant protein 2 (AOP2), which is present in high concentrations in human and mouse red cells. This member of the peroxiredoxin protein family binds to hemoglobin and prevents spontaneous, as well as oxidant-induced, methemoglobin formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Other pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methemoglobin can be reduced directly by ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, riboflavin, tetrahydropterin, cysteine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysteamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cysteamine</a>, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and 3-hydroxykynurenine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These reactions occur slowly and play a minor role in methemoglobin reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, the formation and reduction of methemoglobin by the mechanisms described above act to maintain a steady-state level of methemoglobin of about 1 percent of total hemoglobin. Methemoglobinemia occurs when there is an imbalance between these two processes; causes are either acquired or congenital, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOCHROME B5 REDUCTASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytochrome b5 reductase is a housekeeping enzyme and a member of the flavoenzyme family of dehydrogenases-electron transferases. It is involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH generated by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reduction in the glycolytic pathway to cytochrome b5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. An understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of cytochrome b5 reductase is important for appreciating the manifestations of the syndromes associated with cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">The gene and isoforms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytochrome b5 reductase gene is approximately 31 kilobases long [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and has several potential transcripts generating multiple isoforms. Differences at the 5' end of rat liver and reticulocyte cDNAs suggest the use of alternative promoters for the production of all forms of cytochrome b5 reductase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Multiple isoforms of cytochrome b5 reductase are generated from a single gene by a combination of alternative promoters and alternative initiation of translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. One isoform, found in nonerythroid cells and reticulocytes but not in mature erythrocytes, is a membrane-associated isoform located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and the outer mitochondrial membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This membrane-bound enzyme is an amphophilic protein consisting of a 275 amino acid hydrophilic moiety that contains the active site and a hydrophobic domain at the NH2-terminal end that anchors the protein to the membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Two other isoforms are found solely in erythroid cells. The isoform involved in methemoglobin reduction is soluble and consists of the same 275 hydrophilic amino acids found in the ubiquitously expressed membrane-associated isoform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The other erythroid-specific isoform is membrane-associated with an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence that differs from the sequence found in the soluble isoform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although it contributes only 20 to 25 percent of erythrocyte cytochrome b5 reductase activity in adult humans, it represents a greater proportion in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The function of this isoform is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HEREDITARY METHEMOGLOBINEMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first case of congenital methemoglobinemia was probably reported by Francois in 1845 when he described one of his patients with chronic congenital cyanosis without obvious cardiac or pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A familial incidence of &quot;autotoxic cyanosis&quot; and methemoglobinemia was later described by Hitzenberger in 1932 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Historic accounts of early work on this disorder are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>There are three types of hereditary methemoglobinemia. Two are inherited as autosomal recessive traits: cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency and cytochrome b5 deficiency. Most cases of hereditary methemoglobinemia are due to a deficiency of cytochrome b5 reductase, while only a single case of cytochrome b5 deficiency has been reported. The third type is an autosomal dominant disorder, hemoglobin M (Hb M) disease due to a mutation in the globin molecule itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;</a>.) Each of these three types is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency. Though mutant alleles are expressed on cyb5R in all tissues, in type I, the cytochrome b5 reductase (cyb5R) deficiency is limited to erythrocytes only. This is due to the lack of synthetic activity in mature erythroid cells, which are thus incapable of replenishing the easily degraded, heat-labile mutated proteins. In contrast, type II deficiency results from mutations that affect the catalytic function or cause underproduction of the enzyme, resulting in a generalized decrease in functional cytochrome b5R activity in all cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Type I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of cases of enzymopenic congenital methemoglobinemia are type I, in which the functional deficiency of cytochrome b5 reductase is limited to erythrocytes. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] have methemoglobin concentrations of 10 to 35 percent and appear cyanotic but are usually asymptomatic even with levels up to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Some patients have reported nonspecific symptoms of headache and easy fatigability. Life expectancy is not shortened and pregnancies occur normally. Significant compensatory polycythemia (erythrocytosis) is at times observed. The cyanosis is of cosmetic significance only, but can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> or ascorbic acid, both of which facilitate the reduction of methemoglobin through alternate pathways (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'NADPH-methemoglobin reductase pathway'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the asymptomatic, chronically methemoglobinemic homozygotes (or compound heterozygotes), heterozygous individuals are at risk for developing acute, symptomatic methemoglobinemia after exposure to exogenous methemoglobin-inducing agents. The classic description of acute toxic methemoglobinemia in United States military personnel receiving malarial prophylaxis in Vietnam demonstrated for the first time that heterozygotes for an autosomal recessive disease can, under certain conditions, develop a disease state that is more clinically significant than their asymptomatic homozygous peers. In contrast, homozygotes for enzyme deficiency, because of the chronicity of their methemoglobinemia, are fully accommodated to their disease state, in part by an increase of their erythrocyte mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Type I cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency is distributed worldwide but is endemic in the Athabascan Alaskans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], Navajo Indians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and Yakutsk natives of Siberia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The Navajo Indians and the Athabascan Indians of Alaska are known to share a common ancestor; thus, the high frequency of cytochrome b5R deficiency suggests a common origin for all three of these populations. However, it remains to be determined if the molecular defect resulting in cytochrome b5R deficiency is identical in these populations. In other ethnic and racial groups the defect occurs sporadically. Although cyanosis is difficult to detect due to skin pigmentation, type I deficiency has been reported in two unrelated African-American families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Several point mutations in patients with type I cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency have been reported; all are missense mutations, resulting in an amino acid substitution. Three of these mutations are found in the 5' end of the cytochrome b5R gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. A fourth mutation, a G to A transition in exon 8 (E212K) in an African-American family, occurs in the 3' end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>An additional mutation, resulting in the replacement of threonine by serine at codon 116, is found in exon 5 (T116S) in African-Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, this mutation is not responsible for the enzyme deficiency, since this amino acid substitution causes no readily appreciable disruption of the b5R secondary structure. This missense mutation has been shown to be a high frequency polymorphism of cytochrome b5R specific for African-Americans. It is one of the commonest, African-specific polymorphisms known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In type II cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, which represents approximately 10 percent of cases of enzymopenic congenital methemoglobinemia, cytochrome b5R is deficient in all cells. Type II cytochrome b5R deficiency has a sporadic distribution. In addition to methemoglobinemia and cyanosis, patients exhibit mental retardation and developmental delay with failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Other neurologic symptoms are often present, including microcephaly, opisthotonus, athetoid movements, strabismus, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. Life expectancy is significantly shortened; most individuals die in infancy. The mechanism resulting in the neurologic problems is currently unknown but may be due to abnormal lipid elongation and desaturation in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], or perhaps due to impairment of ferri-iron reduction of other cellular globins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Type II mutations have been reported in both the 5' and 3' ends of the cytochrome b5R gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-64</a>]. Type II mutations are heterogeneous, including deletions, point mutations, splicing site mutations, and premature stop codons, whereas all the mutations found in the type I individuals have been missense mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin M disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin M is due to mutations in either the alpha, beta, or gamma globin molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. In most of the mutations, tyrosine has been substituted for either the proximal or distal histidine in the heme pocket, and forms an iron-phenolate complex that resists reduction to the divalent state.

The ferric hemes of methemoglobin are unable to bind oxygen. In addition, the oxygen affinity of any accompanying ferrous hemes in the hemoglobin tetramer is increased and oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Formation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once formed, methemoglobin can be reduced back to hemoglobin via two potential pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53599 \">figure 2</a>): physiological cytochrome B5 reductase and a pathway that can be activated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> administration (ie, NADPH-methemoglobin reductase). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normally, the formation and reduction of methemoglobin by these mechanisms maintain a steady-state level of methemoglobin of about 1 percent of total hemoglobin.
