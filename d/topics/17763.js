When the gastrointestinal eosinophilia is limited to the esophagus and is accompanied by characteristic symptoms, it is termed eosinophilic esophagitis. Eosinophilic esophagitis is an increasingly recognized cause of dysphagia and possibly heartburn that is unresponsive to antireflux measures.</p><p>The management of eosinophilic esophagitis includes dietary, pharmacologic, and endoscopic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The approach to patients with eosinophilic esophagitis is based primarily on clinical experience, case series, and small controlled trials. In addition, it is uncertain whether treatment of symptoms alone is sufficient or if resolution of the eosinophilic inflammation is required. The goal of therapy in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis is symptomatic relief, ideally with histological improvement in esophageal eosinophilia. In addition, for pediatric patients, therapy aims to restore normal growth and development. </p><p>Commonly used treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination and elemental diets to decrease allergen exposure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid suppression to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may mimic or contribute to eosinophilic esophagitis. In addition, a subset of patients respond clinically and histologically to proton pump inhibitors. Such patients have been referred to as having proton pump inhibitor responsive esophageal eosinophilia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical glucocorticoids to decrease esophageal inflammation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal dilation to treat strictures.</p><p/><p>Other treatments that have been studied include systemic glucocorticoids, antihistamines, immunosuppressants, and immunomodulators.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. The approaches outlined are consistent with a 2011 consensus statement and the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and children are discussed separately. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and children are discussed separately.

Dietary therapy is based upon the observation that patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have high rates of food allergies, and that those allergies may contribute to the development of eosinophilic esophagitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-esophagitis-eoe-genetics-and-immunopathogenesis#H20860162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Genetics and immunopathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Role of the immune system and environmental factors'</a>.) </p><p>The appeal of the dietary approach is that it potentially offers an effective non-pharmacologic treatment. On the other hand, allergen avoidance with elimination and elemental diets poses a risk of nutritional deprivation, can be difficult for patients and families (particularly if nasogastric feedings or gastrostomy tubes are required), can lead to psychological problems, and may lead to unnecessary food aversion. Other important factors that may influence the decision include costs (often not borne by insurance providers), convenience, ease of adherence, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preferences. In addition, relapse upon discontinuation of the diet is common. When used, elemental and elimination diets should be administered under the supervision of a registered dietician. </p><p>We refer both adults and children to an allergist with expertise in the evaluation of food allergies to guide dietary therapy, assist in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, and identify and treat extraesophageal atopic conditions. We suggest avoidance of known allergens (both food and environmental) for patients in whom specific allergies can be identified after discussion of the pros and cons of the dietary approach. Dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis is discussed in detail, separately.

GERD may be a mimic of eosinophilic esophagitis, coexist with it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], or contribute to it. Conversely, eosinophilic esophagitis may contribute to GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis should generally include demonstration of persistent esophageal eosinophilia after a two-month course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (or with a normal pH study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. PPIs may benefit patients with esophageal eosinophilia either by reducing acid production in patients with co-existent GERD, or by other yet undefined anti-inflammatory mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The pathophysiology of underlying PPI-responsiveness is unsettled. There are no methods to identify such patients with PPI-responsive EoE (PPIREE) based on clinical or histologic features, although experimental diagnostic approaches are being explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As a result, it is important that patients with suspected EoE undergo a trial of a PPI before proceeding with other therapeutic options.</p><p>The natural history of patients with PPIREE is incompletely understood. Some patients appear to develop more classical EoE, while others maintain a clinical and histologic response. Still others appear to have improvement in symptoms despite having persistent esophageal eosinophilia. It is also possible that patients with PPIREE may respond to dietary interventions, suggesting that the PPIs are in some way mitigating an underlying allergic diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Until further consensus is achieved, PPIs might be considered as a form of treatment for esophageal eosinophilia and should be considered an initial option in patients suspected of having EoE. As a result, patients suspected of having EoE should undergo a trial of a PPI (typically double dose for eight weeks) before proceeding with other therapeutic approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with eosinophilic esophagitis respond to topical glucocorticoids as demonstrated by a decrease in eosinophil counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. No formulation of topical glucocorticoids has been approved specifically for eosinophilic esophagitis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluticasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> have been best studied.

Symptoms often recur when steroids are discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Randomized controlled trials have not consistently demonstrated an improvement in dysphagia with topical glucocorticoids in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. It is unclear if this is due to differences in patient selection, definitions of symptom response, steroid formulations and duration of treatment, or dietary modification that may have resulted in a higher placebo response rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Predictors of response to glucocorticoids are poorly understood. In a retrospective cohort study that included 221 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis who received topical glucocorticoids, endoscopic, symptomatic, and histologic improvement were noted in 71, 79, and 57 percent of patients who underwent a repeat endoscopy approximately eight weeks after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, esophageal narrowing that required dilation at baseline endoscopy was an independent predictor of a lack of response to topical glucocorticoid therapy and abdominal pain was a predictor of response to therapy (OR nonresponse 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.3 and 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8, respectively). Higher baseline levels of tryptase and eotaxin-3, but not major basic protein, were associated with a response to topical glucocorticoids. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluticasone propionate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluticasone</a> is administered using a metered dose inhaler without a spacer.

In patients who respond, we continue treatment for eight weeks. Patients frequently relapse when treatment is stopped, with reported relapse rates of 14 to 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/4,22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,26,27</a>]. For patients who relapse, we treat and discuss maintenance topical glucocorticoids or a trial of a dietary approach. For patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, options include a higher dose of fluticasone, a change to oral viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, or a dietary approach.</p><p>Representative studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> for eosinophilic esophagitis have shown the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series in adults included 21 patients who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate 220 mcg twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All patients had relief of dysphagia that lasted a minimum of four months. Relief often occurred within a few days after beginning treatment. Three patients (14 percent) relapsed and required additional therapy. Histologic outcomes were not assessed. However, in a later series, clinical improvement was associated with a significant decrease in esophageal eosinophil counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Emerging data in adults suggest a six-food elimination diet can improve symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia and help identify causative foods. As a result, some authorities have begun recommending this approach as a primary option for their adult patients. If a dietary approach is taken, it is important to coordinate it with a nutritionist since elimination and elemental diets can result in important restrictions of calories and nutrients.

Optimal strategies after initial treatment are unsettled. Thus, the decision to continue treatment should be individualized. Because symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia almost universally return when treatment is discontinued, we suggest ongoing treatment, whether medical or nutritional (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some authorities treat on an as-needed basis. Such an approach is particularly useful in patients who have identifiable, seasonal triggers. Others use the lowest dose possible of topical glucocorticoids that allow patients to remain asymptomatic.
