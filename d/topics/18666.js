The majority of primary EBV infections throughout the world are subclinical and unapparent. Antibodies to EBV have been demonstrated in all population groups with a worldwide distribution; approximately 90 to 95 percent of adults are EBV-seropositive.</p><p>Like other members of the herpesvirus family, EBV has a latency phase. The host cells for the organism in humans are B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells and myocytes. Unlike herpes simplex (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV is capable of transforming B cells and does not routinely display a cytopathic effect in cell culture.</p><p>EBV is the primary agent of infectious mononucleosis, persists asymptomatically for life in most adults, and is associated with the development of B cell lymphomas, T cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinomas in certain patients. Reactivation disease is not a prominent issue with EBV, in contrast to other prominent herpesviruses, but it has been associated with an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder in transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The virology and biology of EBV will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of EBV infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV is a member of the gamma herpesvirus family and is the prototype for the lymphocryptovirus genus. In vitro, all gamma herpesviruses replicate in lymphoid cells and some are capable of lytic replication in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Infection of primate B lymphocytes typically results in latent infection. This is characterized by persistence of the viral genome along with expression of a restricted set of latent gene products, which contribute to the transformation process and help drive cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Composition of virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membership in the Herpesviridae family is based upon virion architecture. EBV consists of a toroid-shaped protein core wrapped with linear double-stranded DNA, an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing 162 capsomeres, an amorphous protein tegument surrounding the capsid, and an outer envelope containing glycoprotein spikes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Similar to HSV-1, the major EBV capsid proteins range in size from 28 to 160 KDa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, unlike most other herpesviruses, the outer viral envelope of EBV contains only a single predominant glycoprotein known as <span class=\"nowrap\">gp350/220</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type and strain variations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of EBV, referred to as EBV-1 and EBV-2 (formerly EBV-A and EBV-B), have been identified in most human populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This nomenclature parallels the terminology for HSV-1 and HSV-2. However, in contrast to the latter viruses, there is extensive homology and restriction endonuclease site conservation throughout most of the EBV-1 and EBV-2 genomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The major identified differences between the EBV-1 and EBV-2 genomes exist in the latent infection cycle nuclear antigen genes EBNA-2, EBNA-LP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and in the small, nonpolyadenylated RNAs EBERs 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Advances in next-generation whole genome sequencing (NGS) will lead to a greater understanding of strain variation and cellular tropisms. As an example, EBV derived from a case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was subjected to NGS and found to have a polymorphism in the promoter of the lytic transactivator of BZLF 1, resulting in increased lytic replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The differences between EBV-1 and EBV-2 EBNA genes are reflected in type-specific and type-common EBNA epitopes. Similarly, the immune recognition of EBV transformed B lymphoblastoid cells by EBV-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes is dependent upon the infecting EBV strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. EBV-2 has been shown to latently infect T cells and induce T cell cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Seroepidemiologic studies of reactivity to EBNA-2 have been used to determine the prevalence and geographic distribution of the two EBV strains. In the United States and Europe, the EBV genomes are 10 times more likely to be EBV-1 than EBV-2; in contrast the two genomes are equally distributed in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar serologic findings extend to the EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sera from patients infected with EBV-1 preferentially react with type 1 EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C, whereas sera from individuals infected with EBV-2 preferentially react with type-2 EBNA-3 gene products.</p><p>With respect to homology, the various EBNA gene products share between 50 to 85 percent primary amino acid sequence identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Limited genomic divergence between various EBV-1 isolates has also been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EBV genome consists of a linear, 172-kilobase-pair, double-stranded DNA molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and was completely sequenced in the early 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Genetic studies have been particularly important in determining the biology of this virus (see below). The characteristic features of the EBV genome include a single overall format and gene arrangement and variable tandem repeats. These DNA repeat elements are important landmarks on the EBV genome, which allow the EBV strains to be distinguished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Although EBV DNA is linear in the virus particle, the terminal repeats mediate circularization in infected cells; each infected cell contains 1 to 20 copies of the EBV episomes in the nucleus. The characteristic DNA repeat elements serve as important landmarks on the EBV genome, which allow one to distinguish between EBV strains. While various EBV isolates differ in their tandem repeat frequency, individual EBV isolates tend to contain a constant number of repeats even through serial passage. This is exemplified each time EBV establishes latent infection where the virus persists as an episome containing a set number of tandem terminal repeats. This principle is extremely useful in determining whether or not latently infected cells, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, arise from a single progenitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There is general conservation of the genetic organization between herpesvirus saimiri, a primate gamma herpesvirus, and Epstein-Barr virus; however, there are unique EBV DNA segments which function in latent B cell infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Antigenic cross-reactivity between EBV and other herpesviruses is rare, even among the proteins encoded by the more conserved genes. The EBV genes expressed in latent infection, as well as certain lytic cycle genes, have no detectable homology to other herpesvirus genes and may have arisen in part from cellular DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Examples of EBV lytic cycle genes with significant homology to the human genome, but little homology to other herpesviruses, including BHRF1 and BCRF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. BHRF1 is an EBV early gene with significant homology to the human B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (bcl-2) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], thought to be involved in preventing B cells and other cells from undergoing apoptosis. BCRF1 is an EBV late gene with nearly identical primary amino acid sequence homology and biological activity to human IL-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the function of EBV has been determined from genetic studies of the virus. Various components of EBV and the cells that the virus infects contribute to the pathogenesis of infection including the virus receptor, penetration and uncoating, virus expression in latent infection, and cell transformation with the production of latent proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The host range of Epstein-Barr virus is restricted to humans and certain sub-human primates including squirrel monkeys and cotton top marmosets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Related oncogenic herpesviruses have been detected in Old-World primate species and more recently in New-World primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The EBV receptor on human cells is the B cell surface molecule CD21, which is the receptor for the C3d component of complement (also called CR2, complement receptor type 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The following observations have confirmed this association:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purified CD21 binds to EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virus infection is blocked by anti-CD21 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of CD21 on heterologous cells also allows these cells to bind EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Currently, gp350 is believed to bind exclusively to the CD21 molecule.</p><p/><p>Infection is initiated by the interaction of the major EBV outer envelope glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">gp350/220</span> with CD21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">gp350/220</span> is believed to bind exclusively to the CD21 molecule. Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of <span class=\"nowrap\">gp350/220</span> and C3d has revealed a shared nonapeptide, which probably explains their common binding properties with CD21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The majority of primary EBV infections in humans are thought to originate in the oropharynx. Oropharyngeal epithelial cells, unlike B lymphocytes, are permissive for viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. EBV binds much less efficiently to epithelial cells than B cells. Although most anti-CD21 antibodies do not bind to epithelial cells, small amounts of CD21 mRNA indistinguishable in size from that expressed in B cells have been identified by northern blot hybridization in these cells. Cloning and sequencing of epithelial cell derived RNA has shown it to be identical to B cell derived CD21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>CD21 or related structures are also present on cells of the T lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As an example, both thymocytes and peripheral T cells express CD21 or CD21-like molecules; however, their reactivity with anti-CD21 antibodies differs from that of B cells, suggesting there may be structural differences between T cell and B cell CD21 molecules.</p><p>EBV has also been demonstrated to enter and replicate within monocytes in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Once infected, these monocytes displayed decreased phagocytic activity. These cells may serve as another potential early site for viral replication and for a blunted immune response to the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Adsorption, penetration, and uncoating</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, virus binding to CD21 and the initial phase of penetration are mediated through the major viral coat glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">gp350/220</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/31,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,38</a>]. Virus adsorption on the surface of B cell results in capping of CD21, followed by endocytosis of EBV into smooth membrane vesicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A second EBV envelope glycoprotein (gp85) then mediates fusion of the virus with the vesicle membrane, causing release of the nucleocapsid into the B cell cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Depletion of this protein abolishes fusion with EBV receptor-bearing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A third membrane glycoprotein, gp42, also appears to be essential for penetration of B cells by binding to HLA class II on the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Dissolution of the viral nucleocapsid and transport of the genome to the B cell nucleus are less well understood. Once inside the nucleus, the linear EBV genome circularizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This event precedes or at least coincides with the earliest gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], directed by Wp, an important viral promoter. Wp has been shown to be 11- to 190-fold more active in B cells than other cells and to contain three regions which act as transcriptional binding sites; one of these regions appears to be most active in B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>While EBV can also infect epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, the precise role of the epithelium in EBV replication and persistence has been somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Current evidence suggests that the epithelium surrounding Waldeyer's ring provides a source of infectious virus in the saliva following lytic infection with EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. B cell-epithelial cell interactions may facilitate the infection of epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], but the receptor used by EBV to initiate attachment to epithelial cells remains unknown. Currently available data suggest that EBV may use different CD21-independent mechanisms to enter epithelial cells, depending on the membrane domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Fusion of the EBV envelope with the cell membrane appears to be mediated by an interaction between gH-gL and an unidentified cell surface receptor on epithelial cells.</p><p>EBV encodes numerous microRNAs (miRNAs). The function of these miRNAs is poorly understood, but studies have shown they play a role in disrupting antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>The EBV genome is replicated by cellular DNA polymerases during the cell cycle S phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It persists as multiple, extrachromosomal double-stranded EBV episomes, which are organized into nucleosomes similar to chromosomal DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus expression in latent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of B lymphocyte infection with EBV is the establishment of latency. The viral genes and products have been studied in detail, but the triggers for the shift from latency to lytic replication are not clearly defined.</p><p>Latency is characterized by three distinct processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral persistence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restricted virus expression which alters cell growth and proliferation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained potential for reactivation to lytic replication</p><p/><p>Persistent EBV infection likely results from a dynamic interplay between viral evasion strategies and host immune responses. Potent T-cell activation occurs and high levels of EBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses are generated during acute EBV infection. How and why EBV persists despite these broad and vigorous immune responses is unclear, but recent studies have provided insight into potential EBV immune evasion strategies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBV exploits normal pathways of B cell differentiation to allow it to persist in a transcriptionally quiescent state in memory B cells and thus minimize immune recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Two genes (LMP-1 and LMP-2) encoded by the virus allow an EBV-infected B blast to become a resting memory cell, where EBV persists in a transcriptionally quiescent state. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Transformation and latent proteins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBV can infect resting naive B cells that traffic to germinal centers within lymphoid follicles; these cells escape immune surveillance by turning off production of certain viral proteins (EBNA 2).</p><p/><p>Intracellular persistence of the entire viral genome is achieved through circularization of the linear EBV genome, and maintenance of multiple copies of this covalently closed episomal DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The episomes are replicated semiconservatively during cell cycle S-phase by cellular DNA polymerases, and equal partitioning of episomes to daughter cells is mediated by interactions between the latent origin of plasmid replication (OriP) and EBV nuclear protein-1 (EBNA-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].</p><p>The 172 Kbp EBV genome encodes approximately 100 genes, ten of which are expressed during latency and are thought to be involved in establishing and maintaining the &quot;immortalized&quot; state. Included in this group are six nuclear proteins (EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP), two latent membrane proteins (LMP-1 and 2), and two EBERS = EBV encoded RNA's (EBERs 1, 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Latency can be disrupted by a variety of cellular activators, resulting in the expression of BZLF1 (Z), which induces the switch from viral latency to lytic replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. During lytic replication, the virus reproduces with associated destruction of the host cell. A mutation in Z results in inhibition of the ability to induce lytic replication, but addition of a second factor BRLF1 (R) partially restores this activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Although only about 10 percent of the genes encoded by EBV are expressed in latently infected B cells, the transcribed regions encompass a major portion of the viral genome. The most abundantly transcribed EBV genes in latently infected cells are the EBERs (107 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/cell),</span> distantly followed by LMP-1, which is significantly more abundant than the EBNAs and LMP-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p>EBNA-LP and EBNA-2 are the first EBV proteins expressed during latent infection of B cells, reaching their steady state levels within 24 to 32 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. EBNA-2 is essential to the immortalization process since viruses with deletions encompassing EBNA 2 are immortalization incompetent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. Infection of primary B cells with such EBNA-2 mutants results in failure of expression of EBNA-2 and of genes that have not been deleted such as EBNA-1 and EBNA-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]; there is also less or no transactivation of LMP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Restoration of the deleted DNA in defective EBV produces progeny virus with the ability to transform primary human B lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>EBNA-2 is also required for expression of other EBV latent genes, for the transactivation of both EBV genes and cellular genes (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Transformation and latent proteins'</a> below), and probably for promoter switching during the initial stages of latent B cell infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/virology-of-epstein-barr-virus/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].
