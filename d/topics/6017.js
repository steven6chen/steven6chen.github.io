Improved survival rates have led to increased recognition of long-term treatment-related morbidities, collectively known as &quot;late effects,&quot; with 95 percent of childhood cancer survivors reported to have at least one chronic health condition by the age of 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Endocrine-reproductive disturbances are among the most common late effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These often result in significant morbidity including poor growth, precocious or delayed puberty, thyroid dysfunction, infertility, and metabolic disease. Understanding how to improve the prevention, recognition, and treatment of endocrinopathies will improve the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors and others who are exposed to similar therapies.</p><p>An overview of the most common endocrinopathies observed in childhood cancer survivors and others treated with cytotoxic therapies during childhood will be provided here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1235317480\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOR SURVIVORS OF CANCER AND OTHERS TREATED WITH CYTOTOXIC THERAPIES DURING CHILDHOOD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493567\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for long-term follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine-reproductive disturbances are among the most common late effects of cancer treatment, affecting up to 40 to 60 percent of childhood cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/1-3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5</a>]. In a population-based study from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, the risk of an endocrine disorder in cancer survivors was 4.8 times greater than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, children with cancer diagnosed between five and nine years of age had the highest cumulative risk for an endocrinopathy, which reached 43 percent by the age of 60 years. More recently, an analysis of endocrine abnormalities in 14,290 five-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age six years at diagnosis and 32 years at last follow-up) demonstrated that nearly half of childhood cancer survivors experienced at least one, 16.7 percent at least two, and 6.6 percent three or more endocrinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The cumulative incidence and prevalence of endocrinopathies among survivors in this study increased substantially over time, thus underscoring the need for lifelong screening for those at risk.</p><p>While this review focuses on risk of endocrinopathies among survivors of childhood cancer, the information applies to children treated with cytotoxic therapies during therapy (eg, hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]) for nonmalignant conditions as well. These disorders include bone marrow failure syndromes (eg, Fanconi anemia, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]); primary immunodeficiencies (eg, severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper IgM syndrome); inherited hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]); and inherited metabolic disorders (eg, mucopolysaccharidoses, adrenoleukodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrinopathies-in-cancer-survivors-and-others-exposed-to-cytotoxic-therapies-during-childhood/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]). Risk for endocrine dysfunction in these patients may be due to the underlying condition, the pretransplant conditioning regimen, or a combination of both. Patients with thalassemia are also at risk for a range of endocrinopathies due to potential iron overload arising from their need for multiple blood transfusions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Endocrine dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Long-term outcomes'</a>).

These guidelines, initially published in 2003, provide surveillance recommendations for risk-based follow-up care of childhood cancer survivors from the completion of therapy through adulthood. Patient education materials called &quot;Health Links&quot; complement the guidelines. At entry into a long-term follow-up program, all survivors should receive an individualized treatment summary, which outlines previous exposures, potential late effects, and recommended risk-based screening procedures in accord with COG guidelines. The COG guidelines may also be used to guide risk-based screening practices for individuals with non-cancer diagnoses who were treated with similar cytotoxic therapies. Henceforth, we will use the term &quot;survivors&quot; to refer to individuals treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HCT during childhood or adolescence for a malignant or nonmalignant condition. </p><p>A general overview of cancer survivorship is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;</a>).
