Resort towns in the Western United States alone attract over 30 million visitors annually, generally to sleeping elevations in the 2000 to 3000 m (6500 to 9800 feet) range. Many millions more visit cities at these elevations, including several large cities in South America and Asia situated above 3000 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most of these destinations can be reached within a day.</p><p>In addition, tens of thousands of climbers, trekkers, and skiers worldwide ascend to elevations in the 3000 to 5500 m (9800 to 18,000 feet) range, often at an ascent rate that exceeds an individual's ability to acclimatize. A growing number of mountaineers seek the summits of peaks over 5500 m. Military, rescue, and other professional personnel may also be called upon to ascend to high altitudes with little or no time for acclimatization. Such rapid ascents place the unacclimatized traveler at risk for developing high altitude illness (HAI).</p><p>Clinicians working in or near mountainous areas must familiarize themselves with the presentation and management of HAI, while all health care workers who advise travelers need to understand the best prevention strategies and treatment options. The different types of HAI, their pathophysiology, and general methods for prevention will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific types of HAI are discussed separately.

Oxygen moves from inspired air to the alveolar space via the airways and then diffuses across the alveoli into the blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58392 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97579 \">figure 2</a>), where it is carried mainly bound to hemoglobin but also in dissolved form. At the level of the capillaries, oxygen diffuses across vessel walls, through the tissues and into cells, and ultimately into the mitochondria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The partial pressure of oxygen of inspired air (PIO2) is given by the equation: PIO2 = FIO2 x (Pb - 47 mmHg), where FIO2 is the fraction of oxygen in inspired air, Pb is the barometric pressure, and 47 mmHg is the vapor pressure of H2O at 37&deg;C. Inspired gas is 100 percent humidified by the time it reaches the alveoli and water vapor pressure is affected by temperature but, unlike other gases, is not dependent on altitude. The proportion of air comprised by oxygen (FIO2, 20.94 percent) remains constant at the highest terrestrial elevations and even into the upper troposphere. Hence the PIO2 and, therefore, the oxygen cascade, are directly affected by barometric pressure.</p><p>Barometric pressure diminishes in a curvilinear fashion with increasing altitude (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98575 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199 \">table 3</a>). Barometric pressure also decreases with lower temperature, higher latitude, inclement weather, and during winter. Although the effect of these variables upon barometric pressure is not nearly as significant as altitude, it becomes physiologically significant at elevations over approximately 2800 m (9200 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>At sea level there is a large pressure gradient for oxygen between inspired air and tissue. However, as barometric pressure falls so does the available oxygen. At high altitudes, especially when tissue oxygen demands are high during athletic or work activities, the marked reduction in the pressure gradient and available oxygen can lead to tissue hypoxia. This form of hypoxia is termed hypobaric hypoxia, and it represents the initial cause of high altitude illness (HAI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acclimatization</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As PIO2 decreases with ascent, the normal driving pressure of PO2 down the oxygen cascade diminishes, resulting in progressive hypoxemia and tissue hypoxia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56808\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56808 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The normal compensatory responses to acute hypobaric hypoxia are termed acclimatization, an incompletely understood, complex series of physiologic changes involving multiple organ systems that occurs over varying periods (from minutes to weeks). Acclimatization improves tissue oxygenation by increasing the efficiency with which oxygen moves down the oxygen cascade and by optimizing the utilization of oxygen at the cellular level.</p><p>Acclimatization differs from &ldquo;adaptation,&rdquo; which refers to physiologic changes that take place in response to chronic exposure to hypobaric hypoxia over generations and are observed in some populations permanently situated at high altitude. The capacity to acclimatize varies greatly among individuals and is dependent upon many factors, including the degree of hypoxic stress (rate of ascent, altitude attained), the intrinsic capacity of the individual to compensate for diminished PaO2 (genetic and anatomic variation, medical conditions), and extrinsic factors, which may enhance or interfere with compensatory mechanisms (eg, alcohol, medications, temperature) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The process of acclimatization begins within minutes of ascent but requires several weeks to complete. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1-a) is a transcription factor responsible for activating more than 1000 genes in response to hypoxia, and plays a major role in activating the cellular mechanisms responsible for acclimatization. Other factors and genes are likely be involved as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Although the complex compensatory changes that occur cannot fully restore tissue PO2 to sea-level values, acclimatization can substantially improve oxygen delivery and utilization. In fact, acclimatization enables some climbers to function with only minor difficulty on the peak of Mount Everest (8848 m or 29,029 feet) without supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>At 8848 m, PIO2 is 43.1 mmHg, equivalent to breathing 6 percent oxygen at sea level. Sudden exposure to such high altitude (eg, pilot's cockpit suddenly decompresses) results in loss of consciousness and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A detailed discussion of acclimatization is beyond the scope of this review, but can be found in several excellent sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. A brief review of the beneficial changes that occur during acclimatization is provided below. Other aspects of respiratory physiology are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventilation and PaO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first and most important step in improving oxygen delivery is an increase in ventilation. Without increased ventilation, humans could not tolerate altitudes higher than 5000 m (16,400 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors ( in the carotid and aortic bodies) results in increased minute ventilation and is termed the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). HVR increases in sensitivity over several days spent at altitude. Overall, minute ventilation increases in a nearly linear fashion with diminishing SpO2. The increase in ventilation also lowers the alveolar CO2 and causes a respiratory alkalosis. The reduction of CO2 in the alveolar space reduces the dilutional effect of CO2 in alveolar air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Simultaneously, there is a reduction of the threshold PCO2 level at which ventilation is stimulated (hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR)), further increasing the ventilatory response to high altitude. Ventilation reaches a maximum only after four to seven days at the same altitude. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;, section on 'Peripheral chemoreceptors'</a>.)</p><p>HVR is genetically determined and quite variable among individuals. HVR is not influenced by athletic training but is affected by extrinsic factors, such as respiratory depressants (eg, alcohol and <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotics)</span> and fragmented sleep. Conversely, respiratory stimulants (eg, progesterone) and sympathomimetics (eg, coca, caffeine) increase HVR.</p><p>While one might assume that a brisk HVR would reduce the degree of hypoxemia and protect against acute mountain sickness (AMS), studies have failed to demonstrate this finding consistently. Some elite climbers, endurance athletes, and high altitude residents (Sherpas and Andean peoples) have low HVR and perform well at altitude. However, a low HVR is associated with an increased risk of HAPE, perhaps because it augments hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to an exaggerated increase in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>As ventilation rises in response to hypoxia, PaCO2 falls and pH rises. The central chemoreceptors in the medulla of the brain respond to alkalosis in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by inhibiting ventilation, such that the full hypoxic ventilatory response is attenuated. While peripheral chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in pH, central chemoreceptors play the major role in this response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;, section on 'Central chemoreceptors'</a>.)</p><p>Partial renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis occurs within 24 to 48 hours of ascent as the kidneys excrete bicarbonate, decreasing the pH toward normal, and allowing ventilation to again increase as the alkalosis is reduced. Plasma bicarbonate concentration continues to drop and ventilation to rise with further increases in altitude. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetazolamide</a> rapidly facilitates this process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Compensatory respiratory and renal responses'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Circulatory changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulatory changes following ascent involve the systemic, cerebral, and pulmonary vasculatures. Following a rapid and sustained increase in altitude, increased sympathetic activity transiently increases cardiac output, blood pressure, heart rate, and venous tone. Heart rate remains elevated while stroke volume is diminished due to decreased plasma volume, which can drop as much as 12 percent over the first 24 hours from bicarbonate diuresis, fluid shift from the intravascular space, and suppression of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The effects of altitude upon cardiac function are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cerebral vasculature is highly autoregulated in response to changes in both oxygen and CO2. In the brain, oxygen delivery is dependent upon cerebral blood flow (CBF), which in turn depends upon a balance of vasodilation (in response to hypoxia), vasoconstriction (in response to hypocapnia), and changes in autoregulation. While there is considerable variation of cerebral autoregulation among hypoxic individuals, CBF and oxygen delivery is generally maintained down to SpO2 levels of 70 to 80 percent despite marked hypocapnia. Individual variation in cerebral blood flow is linked to differences in ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypocapnia. Despite mild regional brain tissue hypoxia revealed by near infrared spectroscopy, overall global cerebral metabolism is well-maintained during moderate hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The pulmonary vasculature vasoconstricts in response to hypoxia (Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)), resulting in prompt increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. Increased flow to usually under-perfused areas may augment gas exchange by improving <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> matching. There is marked individual variation of HPV. An exaggerated increase in PA pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is associated with susceptibility to HAPE, as is markedly inconsistent vasoconstriction of pulmonary arterioles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>At altitude, mild pulmonary hypertension at rest can be markedly increased by vigorous exercise, with pulmonary pressure reaching near-systemic levels, especially in people with a history of HAPE. Cold ambient temperatures at high altitude also increase pulmonary artery pressure. To what extent increased pulmonary vascular resistance limits exercise at altitude is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The effect of PDE-5 inhibitors to increase exercise capacity in some persons suggests that those with exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may have exercise limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematologic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) is a well-known component of high altitude acclimatization. A modest increase in [Hb] is beneficial by increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.</p><p>In the first few days at altitude, [Hb] is increased due to plasma volume contraction. Within a few hours, hypoxemia stimulates increased production of erythropoietin from specialized renal cells, which increases the production of red blood cells (RBCs) over 10 to 14 days, resulting in an increased [Hb]. Up to altitudes of approximately 4000 m, this increase is sufficient to balance the reduction in oxygen saturation and restore the oxygen content of arterial blood to sea level values (though now at a lower PO2).</p><p>The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) plays a crucial role in oxygen transport. Because of the sigmoid shape of the curve, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) is well-maintained up to 3000 m, despite a significant decrease in arterial PO2 (PaO2). This correlates with an oxygen saturation of about 88 to 89 percent. Above that altitude, small changes in PaO2 result in large changes in SpO2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure and function of normal hemoglobins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While SpO2 determines tissue oxygenation, PaO2 determines diffusion of oxygen from the capillary to the cell. Intraerythrocytic alkalosis causes a leftward shift of the ODC, but alkalosis is a major stimulus for the production of 2,3 DPG, which shifts the ODC rightward, back toward its normal position. This balance between alkalosis (left shift) and increased 2,3 DPG (right shift) is maintained until sojourners reach very high altitudes. There, the effect of the alkalosis far outstrips the capacity of the RBC to produce more 2,3 DPG, leading to a leftward shift of the ODC.</p><p>As an example, in climbers at the summit of Mount Everest the PaCO2 is 8 to 10 mmHg and the pH rises above 7.6. The resulting shift of the ODC to the left facilitates oxygen-hemoglobin binding in the lung, which results in an advantageous rise in SpO2. Also, animals adapted to high altitude (eg, yaks, llamas, bar-headed geese) have left-shifted ODCs compared with their low-altitude counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygen delivery and utilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries to the mitochondria and its subsequent use by these organelles constitutes the final step of the oxygen cascade. Diffusion distance from capillary wall to mitochondria is decreased at high altitude, mainly because of reduction in the diameter of muscle fibers, which atrophy during high altitude expeditions. This atrophy occurs due to a net energy deficit and deconditioning effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>At the tissue level, HIF-1-a stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenesis and nitric oxide synthesis. This results in greater blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1-a) is a transcription factor responsible for activating more than 1000 genes in response to hypoxia, and its activation plays an important role in acclimatization at a cellular level. Improvements in oxidative metabolism and tissue gas exchange also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">High altitude illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High altitude illness (HAI) is the collective term for the unique cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur following an initial ascent to high altitude or following a further ascent while already at high altitude. HAI includes acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), which afflict the brain, and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), which afflicts the lungs. They are induced by the hypoxic stress of high altitude and are characterized by extravascular fluid accumulation in the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">(AMS/HACE)</span> and lungs (HAPE).

HAPE, which may accompany <span class=\"nowrap\">AMS/HACE,</span> is the most common cause of death among the high altitude illnesses.

It is a form of Cheyne-Stokes respiration and reflects changes in neural signaling due to hypoxia (respiratory stimulant) and alkalosis (respiratory depressant) during sleep. Periodic breathing of altitude may occur at altitudes as low as 1400 m but generally does not disrupt sleep until visitors or climbers reach altitudes above 2750 m. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-ventilatory-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of ventilatory control&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High altitude retinal hemorrhage occurs when there is rupture of retinal arterioles leading to extravasation of blood into the retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The retinal circulation develops many of the same changes seen in the cerebral circulation at altitude.

The elevation attained (particularly the sleeping elevation) and the rate of ascent is of greatest importance when considering hypoxic stress. Conditions that further contribute to hypoxic stress, such as vigorous exertion prior to acclimatization, also increase the risk of HAI.</p><p>Other factors that alter ventilation and the ventilatory response may impair acclimatization. Examples include sedative-hypnotic medications, alcohol, and sleep apnea. Comorbid conditions that impair ventilation, respiration, or oxygen-carrying capacity increase the risk for HAI. Examples include neuromuscular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), restrictive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, carotid artery surgery or neck radiation that ablates the carotid bodies, and congenital cardiac anomalies involving right-to-left shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/24-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-34</a>]. Of note, neither anemia nor asthma is associated with an increased risk for HAI (in fact, asthma generally improves at high altitude). Sickle cell disease is exacerbated by hypoxic environments.

In fact, younger athletes, particularly males, may be at greater risk of HAI for behavioral reasons. They are likely to engage in strenuous exertion prior to acclimatization or to pursue continued ascent, despite the presence of symptoms suggestive of HAI. Such behaviors feature prominently in severe and fatal cases of HAI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pediatric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for HAI are the same in healthy children as in adults.

Shared risk factors among children and adults include the rate of ascent, absolute altitude achieved, degree of physical exertion, and colder ambient temperatures. Risk factors of greater importance for the pediatric population relate to the unique physiology of hypoxia in infants and young children, as well as the effects of concurrent acquired or congenital conditions that are more prevalent in this age group (eg, upper respiratory infection, congenital cardiopulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome). These issues are discussed in greater detail separately.

Although there is no consensus about such classification, the main concept is that progressive ascent results in increased hypoxic stress, requiring greater degrees of physiologic and behavioral adaptations in order to preserve function.</p><p>In terms of HAI, symptoms generally do not manifest below 1500 m (5000 feet). From about 1500 to 2500 m (5000 to 8200 feet), symptoms are generally mild, if experienced at all. At 2500 m, symptoms of mild to moderate AMS become quite common among unacclimatized visitors after rapid ascent. At this altitude HAPE may also occur, but it is more common above 3000 m (9800 feet). Above 3000 to 4000 m (9800 to 13,100 feet), AMS is common among people who have not properly acclimatized, and the risk of severe HAI, including life-threatening HAPE and HACE, is substantial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51907897\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION OF THE TRAVELER TO HIGH ALTITUDE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51907962\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining overall risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the risk of an individual traveler for developing high altitude illness (HAI) may be difficult in some circumstances, but depends primarily upon the ascent profile (ie, how high and how fast), whether there is a history of HAI during previous trips to altitude, and whether the patient has comorbidities that predispose to HAI. Of note, clinicians assessing patient risk must distinguish between the risk for developing HAI (most notably high altitude cerebral edema [HACE] and high altitude pulmonary edema [HAPE]) and the risk that the conditions of high altitude (eg, relative hypoxia) will exacerbate a specific comorbidity (eg, coronary heart disease, sickle cell anemia). This discussion will address only the former; risks associated with the exacerbation of comorbidities are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Developing HAI during a previous trip to altitude places a patient at high risk for recurrence during subsequent trips. However, risks are distinct: the patient with a history of HAPE is at risk for a recurrence of HAPE, but may not be at increased risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">AMS/HACE</span>. When inquiring about a patient&rsquo;s history, clinicians must be careful to clarify what the patient means by altitude-related illness.

Rapid ascents without adequate time provided for acclimatization and ascents to extremely high altitudes increase the risk for HAI in all travelers.</p><p>A useful exercise for determining the risk of HAI is to make a graph, with the patient, of the proposed ascent profile for the trip. A graphic representation showing the daily gain in altitude makes clear to everyone when the rate of ascent is too fast, and the corresponding risk of developing HAI too great. The risks of developing HAI associated with different rates of ascent are described in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65647 \">table 5</a>). </p><p>Other important factors to consider when planning a trip include the ease with which the traveler can descend to lower altitude and the availability of medical care. For travelers at significantly increased risk for HAI, descent from a resort hotel may be reasonable whereas descent from a remote mountainside by yak is probably not. Considerations about the availability of medical resources should include not only nearby clinics but also whether the travel group will include someone experienced in the recognition and acute management of HAI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51907969\"><span class=\"h2\">Diseases and medical conditions that increase risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are relatively few diseases that predispose the traveler to developing HAI. Such conditions include those that impair the body&rsquo;s ability to increase ventilation and acclimatize to high altitude, such as the absence of carotid bodies due to surgical resection or the effects of radiation, neuromuscular disease affecting the thorax and diaphragm, and moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/24-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-34</a>]. Although the evidence is less clear, conditions that exaggerate the effects of hypoxemia are likely to increase the risk for HAI. Such diseases include obstructive sleep apnea, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and congenital cardiac anomalies involving right-to-left shunts (note that patent foramen ovale does <strong>not</strong> increase risk). Pulmonary hypertension clearly predisposes patients to HAPE but not to <span class=\"nowrap\">AMS/HACE</span>. Down&rsquo;s syndrome is a distinct risk factor for HAPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

In addition, patients with chronic headaches are more likely to develop headaches and AMS at altitude. </p><p>There are several common diseases and conditions that some clinicians might intuitively expect to increase the risk for HAI but in fact do not. As examples, asthma often improves at altitude, while anemia is not associated with increased risk. Pregnant patients are less likely to develop HAI. In addition, patients over the age of 50 years, assuming they do not have any of the conditions described immediately above, are at lower risk of developing HAI. Most other common chronic diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes, do not appear to be associated with increased risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51908031\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient assessment begins with a careful history, including questions about any problems that developed during previous trips to altitude and whether the patient has any medical conditions that predispose to HAI. (See <a href=\"#H51907969\" class=\"local\">'Diseases and medical conditions that increase risk'</a> above.)</p><p>As part of the history, it is important to ask about exercise. A patient who exercises regularly, particularly at high intensity, is more than likely to have the physical capacity necessary to travel, climb, or ski at altitude, and is unlikely to have a significant underlying medical condition that might be aggravated by altitude. It is worth inquiring about medical conditions that can be exacerbated by conditions at altitude, such as ischemic heart disease, sleep apnea, and chronic lung disease, and symptoms commonly associated with such ailments, such as chest discomfort or dyspnea with mild exertion, wheezing, or any other breathing difficulty. The risks associated with the exacerbation of comorbidities at altitude are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We ask whether there is a family history of migraine, as altitude may precipitate a first migraine headache. Patients with systemic scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, or other connective tissue diseases associated with pulmonary manifestations warrant careful screening for pulmonary complications before traveling to altitude.

Such findings may reflect the presence of underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease that increases the risk associated with travel to altitude and thus warrant further evaluation. The presence of thoracic irregularities, such as kyphoscoliosis, which may affect pulmonary function, and obesity should be noted.</p><p>Some patients who travel on commercial airlines require supplemental oxygen. It is generally safe to assume that patients who require supplemental oxygen for air travel are at increased risk for developing problems at altitude. Although in some cases potential problems may be avoided if the patient is not traveling to extreme altitudes and has sufficient time to acclimatize, commercial airline travelers who require supplemental oxygen and live at or near sea level typically cannot acclimatize to the conditions of flight (cabin pressures are typically the equivalent of 1400 to 2500 m, or 4000 to 8000 feet). As an example, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient who requires supplemental oxygen for air travel will certainly require it if he or she ascends to a comparable altitude. Screening for these patients begins with pulse oximetry and is discussed in detail separately.

However, in some cases prophylactic medication may be warranted. We recommend prophylactic treatment for all patients at high risk of developing HAI according to the criteria listed in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65647 \">table 5</a>). For healthy patients with no history of medical problems at high altitude, the risk of HAI is low with gradual ascent and routine prophylaxis with medication is not warranted. However, gradual ascent is not always possible and sometimes patients at increased risk wish to travel to altitude. In such cases and for others deemed to be at moderate risk for developing HAI, prophylactic medication may be helpful. However, no medication is completely without risk and we prefer to discuss the use of prophylactic medication with patients at moderate risk and reach a decision with their input. In all cases, rescue medication (given when symptoms begin but not before) is a reasonable alternative to prophylactic medication.</p><p>The medication given for prophylaxis depends upon the individual risk of the patient. The risk for HAPE is typically low, unless the patient has a history of HAPE or is susceptible due to specific underlying pulmonary disease (eg, pulmonary hypertension). Therefore, outside such circumstances, we do not routinely recommend medication prophylaxis for HAPE. If such risk factors are present and prophylaxis is indicated, the preferred prophylactic medication is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>.

As a general guideline, individuals who normally reside below 1500 m (5000 feet) elevation should avoid an abrupt ascent to sleeping altitudes above 2800 m (9200 feet). This is best accomplished by spending one night at an intermediate altitude (particularly when traveling to an elevation that caused symptoms previously).</p><p>If further ascent above 3000 m (9800 feet) is planned, we suggest not spending subsequent nights at elevations over 500 m higher than the previous night, and including a rest day (no ascent and no vigorous activity) for every 1000 m (3280 feet) climbed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115963\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115963 \">figure 4</a>).

For others, it may be agonizingly slow.</p><p>A common adage among mountaineers is &quot;climb high, sleep low.&quot; Day trips to higher elevation with a return to a lower altitude for sleep may accelerate acclimatization and help to prevent HAI.</p><p>If time is available, staged ascent is another approach to acclimatization that reduces the risk of developing HAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Staged ascent involves ascending to altitude in stages. Five to seven days is spent at an intermediate altitude (typically 3000 to 4000 m) before proceeding to higher elevations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342784961\"><span class=\"h3\">Preacclimatization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preacclimatization involving preexposure to higher altitudes (hypobaric hypoxia) or environments that simulate high altitude (normobaric hypoxia) is an effective strategy for preventing HAI. Residing at a site above 2500 m (8200 feet) or participating in brief climbs to actual elevations over 2500 to 3000 m (8200 to 9840 feet) in the weeks leading up to a trip to higher elevations (approximately 4500 m [14,800 feet], or higher) provides a degree of preacclimatization, and may allow for a faster rate of ascent without AMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/1,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,46-48</a>]. However, evidence is limited about whether brief exposures to high altitude are effective and the optimal strategy for preacclimatization remains unproven. As a general rule of thumb, the altitude of preexposure climbs, real or simulated, should reach within approximately 2000 m or closer of the ultimate altitude. If extended preexposure is not feasible, a reasonable alternative would be to travel to such altitudes for two or three weekends during the two months prior to the trip.</p><p>While hypobaric hypoxia appears to be more effective, an alternative approach to preacclimatization involves using normobaric hypoxia to simulate the relative hypoxia of high altitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/44,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49-51</a>]. Such programs are sometimes called intermittent normobaric hypoxic exposure (INHE). INHE programs use commercially-available devices involving face masks or sealed tents or chambers that allow users to decrease the percentage of inhaled oxygen from 21 percent (sea level) to below 16 percent during sleep or while exercising for variable intervals of time and duration. While INHE is more convenient than traveling to altitude and the physiologic basis appears sound, there is less evidence that this approach is effective at reducing the risk for HAI, unless exposure is for more than seven to eight hours per day for at least a week. A small randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that two weeks of sleeping at a <strong>simulated</strong> altitude of 2200 to 2600 m was required to prevent AMS at 4600 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Coca tea typically contains only a tiny amount of cocaine alkaloid and is unlikely to have much impact on preventing HAI, although it may slightly enhance exercise tolerance and provide some hydration, depending on how much is consumed. The effect of chewing coca leaves on preventing or treating HAI has not been well studied, but there is no convincing evidence of benefit, while the harms of coca are well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention/abstract/58,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,60</a>]. We do not recommend chewing coca leaves as a means for preventing HAI.

The normal compensatory response to hypobaric hypoxia is termed acclimatization. The capacity to acclimatize varies greatly among individuals and is dependent upon many factors, including the degree of hypoxic stress (rate of ascent, altitude attained), the intrinsic capacity of the individual to compensate for diminished PaO2, and extrinsic factors. The process begins within minutes of ascent but requires three to five days for protection from HAI but several weeks to complete. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'High altitude physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High altitude illness (HAI) is the collective term for the pathologic syndromes that can develop following an initial ascent to high altitude or following a further ascent while already at high altitude. HAI includes acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), which afflict the brain, and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), which afflicts the lungs. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual factors associated with an increased risk for HAI include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Past history of HAI (strongly predictive if conditions are similar)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rate of ascent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altitude attained, especially sleeping altitude </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vigorous exertion prior to acclimatization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substances (eg, alcohol) or conditions that interfere with acclimatization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Comorbidities that interfere with respiration (eg, neuromuscular disease) or circulation (eg, pulmonary hypertension) (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Individual'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive ascent results in increased hypoxic stress, requiring greater degrees of physiologic and behavioral adaptations in order to preserve function. The more rapid the ascent and the higher the altitude, the greater the stress. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Environmental'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals ascend to high altitude without complications by allowing sufficient time to acclimatize. Patients with a known predilection for HAI despite gradual ascent, and others who must ascend rapidly for convenience (eg, tourists traveling to mountain resort) or work (eg, rescue personnel) may benefit from pharmacologic prophylaxis, which is discussed in greater separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic medications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic prevention of AMS/HACE'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gradual ascent is the surest and safest method of preventing or ameliorating HAI. As a general guideline, individuals who normally reside below 1500 m (5000 feet) elevation should avoid an abrupt ascent to sleeping altitudes above 2800 m (9200 feet). Sedative-hypnotics should be avoided during acclimatization. Abstinence from alcohol is safest, but a single drink is unlikely to cause problems. Vigorous exertion at altitude contributes to the development of both AMS and HAPE, and should also be avoided during acclimatization. Additional preventive strategies are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies for assessing the traveler to altitude and determining their risk of developing HAI are reviewed in the text. During such evaluations, it is important to distinguish between the risk of developing HAI and the risk that high altitude may exacerbate a specific comorbidity (eg, coronary heart disease). A useful exercise for determining the risk of HAI is to make a graph, with the patient, of the proposed ascent profile for the trip. Other important factors to consider when planning a trip include the ease with which the traveler can descend to lower altitude and the availability of medical care. (See <a href=\"#H51907897\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification of the traveler to high altitude'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Roach RC, Lawley JS, Hackett PH.
