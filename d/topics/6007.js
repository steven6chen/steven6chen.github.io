Overall prognosis has improved in recent decades, perhaps due to the use of combined immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, a report using data from the United States Renal Data System from 1995 to 2006 found increases in the standardized incidence of ESRD due to lupus nephritis in younger individuals (ie, age &lt;40 years), in African Americans and American Indians, and in individuals from the southeastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Issues related to ESRD in patients with lupus nephritis are reviewed here.

How this occurs is not well understood.</p><p>In a review of the literature, the percentage of patients with active clinical lupus (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias,</span> rash, and serositis) fell from 55 percent at the onset of dialysis to 6.5 percent in the fifth year and, in a small number of patients, to 0 percent in the 10<sup>th</sup> year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During this time span, the incidence of serologic activity (defined as the percentage of patients with two or more abnormal studies for ANA, anti-dsDNA, CH50, or C3) fell from 80 to 22 percent. In addition, most patients in whom the disease remains active have only mild to moderate symptoms. As an example, in one study, the number of patients with severe extrarenal disease activity (defined by a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index [SLE-DAI] &gt;10) declined from 17 to 3 after the initiation of dialysis and to zero after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these observations, some investigators contend that the observation that lupus becomes quiescent with the onset of ESRD is exaggerated and that dialysis patients may continue to have extrarenal manifestations including alopecia, arthritis, myositis, pleuritis, pericarditis, fever, and vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The contradictory observations concerning the degree to which disease activity abates after the onset of ESRD may be due in part to varying patient population and the clinical specialty of the examining physician (ie, nephrology versus rheumatology versus dermatology). In a study of 19 patients with lupus who were undergoing dialysis (12 patients) or had undergone renal transplantation (seven patients), disease activity using combined clinical and serological data was increased after the institution of dialysis, but <strong>not</strong> after renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A probable contributing factor is that 16 of the 19 patients were black women, a subgroup that has a higher incidence of both persistent lupus activity after the initiation of dialysis and recurrent lupus nephritis in the renal transplant. (See <a href=\"#H480100821\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS IN DIALYSIS PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient survival with either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appears to be similar to that in the general population of patients with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,9</a>]. In an analysis of 11,023 ESRD patients with systemic lupus erythematosus initiating peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, there was a similar overall mortality between the two groups of 21 to 22 percent over three years. This was also true for cardiovascular- and infection-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There is, however, an increased risk of death during the first three months of dialysis due primarily to sepsis and other complications of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, peritoneal dialysis is associated with an increased risk of peritonitis and non-catheter-related infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

This was best shown in a long-term study of 77 adults with lupus nephritis and 154 matched non-lupus glomerulonephritis control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year death-censored graft survival was similar between groups (88, 81, and 71 percent in lupus patients and 91, 83, and 74 percent in control patients, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257989415\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been recommended that all patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis be dialyzed for at least three to six months and be on less than 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day before renal transplantation is performed, particularly among those with relatively rapid progression to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/6,8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,25</a>]. There are two potential advantages to this regimen: It may lead to a further reduction in lupus activity, and it gives patients with relatively acute renal failure time to recover sufficient renal function for dialysis to be discontinued, which removes the indication for transplantation. However, a period of dialysis is not necessary for patients with a slow, progressive course to ESRD who have been shown to have only chronic sclerosing lesion on kidney biopsy and who exhibit no clinical or serologic activity. Such patients often undergo preemptive renal transplantation.</p><p>Formerly, some recommended that renal transplantation be delayed until patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis have undergone dialysis for at least one year. However, the data, including a large analysis, do not support a longer wait prior to transplantation. In an older study of 32 patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis who underwent renal transplantation after a period of dialysis, 22 did so in less than one year. The duration of prior dialysis did not affect renal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another study using ESRD surveillance data from the United States Renal Data System, with 4743 patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis who received a first transplant on or after January 1, 2000 (follow-up through September 30, 2011), found that longer wait times to transplant were associated with equivalent or worse graft outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among white patients, those who were transplanted later, compared with those who received a transplant with less than three months of dialysis, were at increased risk of graft failure (3 to 12 months, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 12 to 24 months, adjusted HR 1.37; 24 to 36 months, adjusted HR 1.34; and &gt;36 months, adjusted HR 1.98). However, no such association was seen among African-American recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475340\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppressive therapy for antirejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction and maintenance immunosuppressive regimens to prevent rejection are the same among patients with ESRD from lupus nephritis as among patients with other forms of renal disease, although the use of glucocorticoid-free regimens among patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis is not standard practice. Moreover, considerations of prior therapies for lupus nephritis (eg, prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and other immunosuppressives) may influence the risk of transplant marrow suppression and infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

The rate of recurrent symptoms of systemic lupus is also low, at approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These low rates are thought to reflect diminished immunologic activity.</p><p>In the largest reported series, the frequency and outcome of recurrence was analyzed using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) files [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 6850 patients with ESRD due to lupus nephritis who received a transplant between 1987 and 2006, 167 (2.4 percent) had recurrent lupus nephritis. Rejection (categorized by individual transplant centers as hyperacute, acute, and chronic by histology) was much more common, occurring in 1770 patients (25.8 percent). Eighty-six percent of patients who had rejection had graft failure during the follow-up period. Non-Hispanic blacks, females, and younger recipients (33 years or younger) were at increased risk for recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 1.88, 1.70, and 1.69, respectively). Similar risk factors have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Higher rates of recurrence have been reported in some later studies. This is due at least in part to the increased use of allograft biopsies and, in particular, the detection of subclinical recurrence by protocol biopsies. The following observations are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated biopsies of 41 renal transplant recipients with a history of ESRD due to lupus nephritis: 38 were surveillance biopsies (ie, performed as protocol), and three were performed for possible rejection or possible recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Biopsy-proven recurrence of lupus nephritis was present in 22 patients (54 percent), most of whom had subclinical disease that was pathologically classified as class I (minimal mesangial) or class II (mesangial proliferative) nephritis. In contrast, 34 patients (83 percent) had chronic allograft nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 54 patients with lupus, 31 underwent transplant renal biopsy because of worsening renal function and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Among 50 patients with at least three months of follow-up, recurrent lupus nephritis was noted in 15, resulting in a recurrence rate of 30 percent. However, the worsening renal function may have primarily reflected mechanisms other than recurrent lupus as suggested by the following observations. First, most patients had class II (mesangial proliferative) or class III (focal proliferative) disease; none had class IV (diffuse proliferative). Second, most patients had one or more other histologic findings that could have contributed to the worsening renal function, including acute rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> nephrotoxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480100944\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation and biopsy findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with recurrent lupus nephritis generally present with an increased serum creatinine above their usual baseline, new-onset or worsening proteinuria of a variable degree, and new-onset hematuria on routine screening.

On biopsy, the histologic lesion may be different and is often less severe from that observed in the native kidney, as is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 177 patients with lupus nephritis and a renal transplant followed over a 30-year interval included 20 patients (11 percent) with recurrent nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the native kidneys, the predominant lesion was either a proliferative glomerulonephritis (class III or class IV, n = 10) or membranous nephropathy (class V, n = 6). In contrast, in the transplanted kidneys, the nephritis was most often only a mesangial lesion (class II, n = 12), with just three patients having proliferative lesions.

In a series of nine patients with recurrent lupus nephritis, for example, only three had serologic evidence of active lupus, and only one had extrarenal symptoms (arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21086538\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is suspected among patients who develop proteinuria, hematuria, or an increased serum creatinine.

These data are discussed elsewhere.

The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in kidney transplant recipients were best evaluated in a systematic review of 21 randomized trials with 1549 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At a median follow-up of 27 months, these agents modestly decreased the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria, but there were inadequate data to assess an effect on allograft and patient survival. A subsequent meta-analysis of eight randomized trials and 1502 patients found that RAS inhibition did not significantly alter all-cause mortality, transplant failure, or doubling of the creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/end-stage-renal-disease-due-to-lupus-nephritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the relatively short follow-up (median 1.5 years) and small number of studies and events limit any conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis. These data are discussed in depth elsewhere.

However, given that transplant recipients are generally closely followed and such side effects would be readily detected, we believe the potential benefit of RAS inhibitors in delaying the onset of ESRD among proteinuric patients outweighs the potential risk of a reversible decline in eGFR, hyperkalemia, or anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587480222\"><span class=\"h4\">Immunosuppressive treatment of recurrent nephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with recurrent lupus nephritis, particularly those who have mild lesions on allograft biopsy, do not require any change in the immunosuppressive regimen that they use to prevent rejection.</p><p>Selected patients may require immunosuppressive therapy directed at recurrent lupus nephritis.

Overall prognosis has improved in recent decades, perhaps due to the use of combined immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of ESRD is often, though not always, associated with gradual complete or partial resolution of the extrarenal manifestations of lupus, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H9521747\" class=\"local\">'Lupus activity in end-stage renal disease patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival with either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appears to be similar to that in the general population of patients with ESRD, although there is an increased risk of death during the first three months of dialysis due to sepsis and other complications of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy. There is an increased risk of peritonitis and non-catheter-related infection among peritoneal dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis in dialysis patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplantation is a suitable option for patients with lupus nephritis. Overall 5- and 10-year graft survival rates are similar among patients with lupus compared with those among patients with other diseases. Lupus patients should be screened for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies prior to renal transplant as renal transplant recipients with underlying lupus who have antiphospholipid antibodies may be at increased risk for thrombotic events. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Issues related to renal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus nephritis is reported to recur in the transplanted kidney in 2 to 11 percent of patients. Patients with clinically significant recurrence requiring an alteration of therapy generally present with an increased serum creatinine above their usual baseline, new-onset proteinuria of a variable degree, and new-onset hematuria. Most episodes of recurrence occur in the first 10 years. Recurrent lupus nephritis is often more mild than the original disease was in the native kidney and has a good prognosis. The incidence of graft loss due to recurrent disease is less than 2 to 4 percent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent lupus nephritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent lupus nephritis is suspected among patients who develop proteinuria, hematuria, or an increased serum creatinine. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Prior to performing a biopsy, among all transplant recipients who present with an elevated serum creatinine, we first ensure adequate hydration, ensure an appropriate serum calcineurin inhibitor concentration, and obtain a renal ultrasound. In addition, among transplant recipients who have a history of lupus nephritis, we perform a renal biopsy in the setting of abnormal protein excretion or hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H21086538\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of recurrent lupus nephritis depends on the clinical presentation and the histology. Among all patients who have recurrent disease and proteinuria &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> we suggest treating with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), as tolerated with monitoring of serum potassium, creatinine, and decrease in blood pressure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H587480215\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive treatment of recurrent nephritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Selected patients may require modification of the immunosuppressive regimen. We suggest that patients who have a histologic diagnosis of recurrent lupus nephritis and a rapid deterioration of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or proteinuria &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or those with a severe proliferative lesions on biopsy be treated with immunosuppressive agents targeted to treat lupus nephritis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
