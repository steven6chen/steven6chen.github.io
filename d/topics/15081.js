It was described in 1966 by Andreas Rett, an Austrian pediatrician and neurologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After a brief period of initially normal development, affected patients experience loss of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, and gait abnormalities. Additional features include deceleration of head growth, seizures, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most cases result from mutations in the MECP2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Rett syndrome. The treatment and prognosis are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rett-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rett syndrome: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autism spectrum disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of patients, RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which maps to Xq28 and encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although MeCP2 is expressed in all tissues, it is most abundant in the brain, which may be more sensitive to abnormal MeCP2 than other tissues. Mutations in MECP2 have been detected in approximately 95 percent of classic sporadic RTT cases and 75 percent of atypical RTT cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A minority of patients have atypical RTT caused by mutations in CDLK5 or FOXG1 genes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classification and major features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1217387243\" class=\"local\">'Atypical RTT'</a> below.)</p><p>Three types of MECP2 mutations occur: missense, frameshift, and nonsense. The type of mutation may affect phenotypic expression. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Genotype-phenotype correlations'</a> below.)</p><p>Rett syndrome is sporadic in nearly all cases (&gt;99 percent) and is most often due to de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These mutations are almost exclusively of paternal origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This may explain the high female to male ratio in RTT and suggests another cause of male sparing besides lethality. In rare familial cases, the mother was either a carrier of the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-12</a>] or a mosaic for the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one family with affected male children and a female child with classic RTT, the MECP2 mutation was located on the mother's paternal X-chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most individuals with RTT have random X-inactivation (also known as Lyonization) so that the normal allele is expressed in some cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. The normal allele appears to enable affected females to survive but does not protect them from neurodevelopmental abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Random inactivation also contributes to the spectrum of phenotypes in RTT. Except in special circumstances such as Klinefelter syndrome or mosaicism, similar mutations in brothers of affected girls result in severe neonatal encephalopathy and are lethal.</p><p>Some affected patients have nonrandom X-inactivation. In one series, this was associated with a milder phenotype or a mitigated classic RTT caused by a rare, early truncating mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Mutations of the MECP2 gene have also been detected in other neurologic disorders. These include girls with non-Rett phenotypes such as autism, girls and boys with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation, and boys with progressive spasticity, congenital encephalopathy with respiratory arrest, or non-fatal neurodevelopmental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How MECP2 mutations lead to RTT is not yet established. MECP2 contains two functional domains, a methyl-CpG binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MECP2 is considered a high-level genome-wide regulator with a variety of putative functions, which include transcriptional repression and activation, modulation of transcription and retrotransposition of long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (L1s) in neurons, and promotion of gene imprinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, it is likely that MeCP2 deficiency or loss of function causes aberrant expression of its different target genes during and after neuronal development, which results in RTT. One hypothesis is that MeCP2 deficiency leads to failure of synaptic maturation and maintenance in the cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another suggests that MeCP2 deficiency causes abnormal brain cholesterol metabolism, thereby disrupting neuronal development and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are more than 250 known pathogenic MECP2 mutations associated with RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the nine most frequently identified mutations (R106W, R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X, R306C, and C-terminal truncations) together account for 78 percent of the MECP2 mutations reported in patients with RTT.</p><p>Data from studies evaluating large databases or series of patients with RTT and animal models suggest that the R133C, R294X, and C-terminal truncating mutations are associated with somewhat milder disease, while the R168X, R255X, R270X, and T158M mutations are associated with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21-26</a>]. Although these phenotypic differences can be distinguished among RTT populations, the MECP2 mutations have broadly overlapping phenotypic variability. While their prognostic value for individual patients with RTT is limited, these data may serve as a general guide to phenotype severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain growth is differentially affected in RTT. In a postmortem study of 39 patients 3 to 35 years old, most RTT brains were smaller than normal and did not grow after age four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, the heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen grew at a normal rate until 8 to 12 years of age. At that time, their growth rate decelerated but continued so that organ weights were appropriate for height, which was also reduced. Adrenal organ weights were normal.</p><p>Deceleration of brain growth in RTT begins after birth. The mechanism is uncertain but appears to reflect arrested development. This is supported by morphologic observations that include no evidence of brain degeneration, no alteration in brain weight with increasing age, lack of correlation of dendritic length with increasing age, and reduced neuromelanin in the substantia nigra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>].</p><p>In one study, the dendrites of pyramidal neurons were examined in six regions of the cerebral cortex in girls with RTT, ages 2.9 to 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The cortex was selectively involved. The apical and basilar dendritic branches in layers 3 and 5 of the frontal, motor, and inferior temporal cortex were shorter compared to brains in trisomy 21 or non-Rett neurologic disorders. These findings did not change with age.</p><p>In other reports, the proteins that initiate cortical dendritic differentiation and expansion (Map2, adult form) and dendritic remodeling (cyclooxygenase) were defectively expressed in RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This indicated marked disruption of a major cytoskeletal component in the cortex. The relationship of these findings with the MECP2 mutation is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33403553\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RTT is a rare disorder that occurs mainly in females. In a report from a large population-based registry in Texas, the prevalence of classic RTT was estimated as one per 22,800 females ages 2 through 18 years, or 0.44 per 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The prevalence per 10,000 girls was 0.56 in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], 0.65 in Sweden and Scotland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], and 0.72 in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. RTT occurs in all ethnic and racial groups, and at similar rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND MAJOR FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical phenotype of RTT is broad and is divided into two main categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical (classic) RTT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical (variant) RTT</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2830321633\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical RTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical picture of typical (classic) RTT is unique. Affected patients initially develop normally and then experience loss of speech and purposeful hand use and onset of stereotypic hand movement and gait abnormalities. Additional manifestations can include deceleration of head growth, seizures, autistic features, intermittent breathing abnormalities, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, and sleep disturbances.</p><p>Girls with classic RTT are typically born at term after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. They usually appear developmentally normal for the first six months with no gross abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53558\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53558 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76864 \">picture 2</a>). Although some nonspecific signs may be present during the first six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], no clinically significant developmental problems typically appear during that time other than deceleration of head growth.</p><p>Deceleration of head growth beginning as early as two to three months of age is often the first sign of RTT, although this feature is not present in all individuals with typical RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and is no longer considered one of the necessary criteria for RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At 12 to 18 months, loss of acquired fine motor, intellectual, and communicative abilities is seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65333\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65333 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56128\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56128 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In some cases, this regression is rapid, with parents reporting &quot;She woke up and was no longer speaking.&quot; More often, regression is slow and insidious, occurring over weeks to months with diminished interest in the surroundings and loss of purposeful hand use. During this phase, unprovoked episodes of inconsolable screaming may occur during the day or at night, disrupting sleep. These begin abruptly, may last for hours, and often provoke an exhaustive evaluation for other medical conditions if RTT has not yet been diagnosed.</p><p>In the beginning of the regression phase, stereotypic hand movements may be subtle and interspersed with purposeful hand use. They typically consist of periodic hand-to-mouth licking or grasping of the hair or clothing. Each girl develops her own distinctive unique hand pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67899 \">picture 5</a>). Some retain the ability to hold a cup or feed themselves in a messy, rudimentary manner.</p><p>Following the regression phase, there is a period of some recovery of nonverbal communication, with improved eye contact and nonverbal interactions with the environment. This is followed by a slow, insidious deterioration in gross motor function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1217387243\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical RTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical RTT is the term used for variants of RTT that have many but not all of the clinical features of typical RTT. There are three defined atypical forms of RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preserved speech variant (or Zappella variant) of RTT is a less severe form of the syndrome that is characterized by recovery of language after regression, with most girls able to speak in sentences, and generally milder expression of typical RTT features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. The majority of girls with this variant have pathogenic MECP2 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early-onset seizure variant (or Hanefeld variant) of RTT is caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene and is characterized by a Rett-like picture with the onset of epilepsy between the first week and fifth month of life as a significant feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The congenital variant (or Rolando variant) of RTT caused by mutations in the FOXG1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>] is distinct from RTT due to MECP2 mutation by onset within the first six months of life.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1466388415\"><span class=\"h2\">Males with RTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most affected individuals with RTT are female, but there are rare reports of males with RTT. A 2015 systematic review identified 36 studies describing 57 cases of RTT in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. All of the included cases had either a confirmatory diagnosis of RTT or clinical features consistent with typical or atypical RTT. The average age was 7.7 years, and the most common symptoms were abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">gait/trunk</span> movements, partial or complete loss of spoken language, head growth deceleration, and epilepsy. MeCP2 mutations were reported in 65 percent of cases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3807189153\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, manifestations of RTT typically include loss of purposeful hand skills, gait and motor abnormalities, loss of spoken language, and stereotypic hand movements. Additional features of RTT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorganized breathing pattern during wakefulness characterized by periods of apnea alternating with periods of hyperventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone mineral deficit and fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction, characterized by cold feet and peripheral vasomotor disturbances</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbances</p><p/><p>These are reviewed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107356647\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of spoken language</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of girls with RTT lose expressive language, although some may retain one-word expressions. They appear to communicate via eye gaze, body language, and facial expressions. However, it is often difficult to measure these behaviors using standardized instruments. A systematic review of eight studies that included 41 females with RTT (age 2 to 36 years) found some evidence of communicative behaviors for at least some girls in each included study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The authors concluded that the validity of these findings is unknown, in part because of the lack of valid measuring tools to assess communication in subjects with impairments as severe as those found in girls with RTT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107358573\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrapyramidal motor dysfunction with stereotypic hand movements and gait disturbance affects all patients with RTT. Stereotypic hand movements include opposition of hands, finger kneading and rubbing, hand clapping and washing, wringing, squeezing, twisting, and pill rolling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67899 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The gait typically is broad-based, clumsy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ataxic/apraxic</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,47</a>]. Patients often have retropulsion and rock to and fro while standing or sitting. Many have difficulty crossing from one floor surface or color to another and will stop and refuse to take another step.</p><p>Extrapyramidal motor disturbances were characterized in a series of 32 affected patients, ages 30 months to 28 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

By age 16, the prevalence of scoliosis in patients with RTT ranges from 50 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. Factors that are associated with scoliosis include delayed, lost, or absent walking, higher clinical severity scores, and constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. In addition, the risk for developing scoliosis may vary with genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. In an analysis of a large RTT database, the risk of scoliosis (after adjusting for age and other clinical parameters) was significantly decreased for the R294X and R306C mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27884434\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic growth pattern of RTT consists of early deceleration of head growth, followed by deceleration of weight and height measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In another study from the same group, metabolic rates while sleeping and quietly awake were 23 percent lower in girls with RTT than controls; rates while actively awake were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Although total daily energy expenditure was similar in the two groups, energy balance was less positive in the girls with RTT than controls. If sustained, these small deficits in energy balance may account for growth failure.</p><p>Aggressive nutritional support improves growth in RTT, confirming the importance of dietary energy intake. In a preliminary report, an aggressive nutritional intervention was made in girls with RTT using gastrostomy feedings in amounts that approximated an energy intake of 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

However, the weight gain consisted of 63 percent fat and only 37 percent lean body mass. This deficit in lean body mass deposition may be explained by a defect in body protein metabolism. In another preliminary report, rates of amino acid loss were significantly greater in subjects with RTT than controls, indicating failure to suppress endogenous body protein degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In addition to oromotor dysfunction, the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract may be affected.

Abnormalities of oropharyngeal function included poor tongue mobility, reduced oropharyngeal clearance, and laryngeal penetration of liquids and solid foods during swallowing. Esophageal dysmotility, characterized by the absence of primary or secondary waves, delayed emptying, atony, the presence of tertiary waves, or spasm was found in 11 patients (39 percent). Gastroesophageal reflux was present in 11 patients (35 percent), including one with nasopharyngeal reflux. Six patients (20 percent) had gastric dysmotility, characterized as decreased peristalsis or atony, and one had duodenal dysmotility.</p><p>In another study, decreased dietary energy intake was associated with poor chewing and persistence of liquid and solid food residue in the pyriform sinuses and valleculae, as well as decreased body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33395658\"><span class=\"h2\">Epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures occur in the majority of patients with RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. A large study from the Rare Disease Network for Rett syndrome reported 528 patients (ages 8 months to 64 years) who met classic criteria for RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

As an example, a series from Sweden reported that epilepsy affected 50 of 53 patients with RTT (94 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Two of the nine deaths that occurred were associated with seizures (aspiration and status epilepticus). Patients in the series had all seizure types except for typical absences and clonic seizures. The most common were complex partial, tonic-clonic, tonic, and myoclonic seizures. In this series, intractable (medically refractory) epilepsy was observed in approximately one-half of the patients.</p><p>The occurrence of epilepsy in RTT may be overestimated because affected patients have a variety of abnormal behaviors that can be mistaken as seizure manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,87,88</a>]. These include breath holding, hyperventilation, incessant hand wringing, &quot;vacant&quot; episodes with sudden-absence-like freezing of activity, inappropriate screaming or laughter, and motor abnormalities (dystonia, tremulousness, and limpness). However, these events do not have associated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes. This point was illustrated by a study of <span class=\"nowrap\">video/polygraphic/EEG</span> monitoring in 82 females with RTT ages 2 to 30 years, all of whom had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. During monitoring, 51 percent of the parents identified events that they thought represented their child's typical seizure, such as twitching, jerking, head turning, falling forward, and trembling, as well as episodes of staring, laughing, pupil dilatation, breath holding, and hyperventilation. However, only 18 percent of these clinical episodes correlated with an EEG seizure discharge. In addition, some electrographic seizures were unrecognized by parents or occurred during sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27884455\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone mineral deficit and fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone density frequently appears diminished on conventional radiographs in girls with RTT, although the cause is unknown. This is seen in affected children (age two to five years) and adults, whether or not they are ambulatory. Girls with RTT have abnormally low regional bone mineral density and whole-body bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].

The risk appears to be associated with the presence of decreased bone thickness, more severe mutations, and the use of antiepileptic medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27884469\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual incidence of sudden, unexpected death is higher in RTT than in the general population (0.3 percent, versus 0.0001 percent for people ages 1 to 22 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>]. The mechanism is thought to be cardiac electrical instability due to abnormal autonomic nervous system regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Increased sympathetic activity (see <a href=\"#H4046451811\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic dysfunction'</a> below) is suggested by the increased incidence of prolonged QTc in RTT. In several reports, the incidence of prolonged QTc (&gt;0.45 msec) was higher and heart rate variability was lower in girls with RTT than age-matched healthy girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/97,100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,100-102</a>].

This pattern consists of episodes of hyperventilation with concomitant hypocapnia alternating with hypoventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apnea. The periods of hypoventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apnea may last as long as 20 to 120 seconds and result in hypoxemia. Breathing usually is normal between these episodes.</p><p>Episodes of hyperventilation tend to occur when the child is excited or agitated, and are frequently associated with other stereotypic movements. Apnea that occurs during wakefulness is typically central, although it may be obstructive. These events may be isolated, or precede or follow hyperventilation. During apneic episodes, the child may stare quietly ahead or smile and appear happy with no evidence of distress, despite severe cyanosis.</p><p>Breathing abnormalities may cause severe hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. In studies recording EEG and breathing in our laboratory, hypoxemia led to electrographic seizures only when it was associated with apnea. Seizures did not occur with disorganized breathing alone, even when oxygen saturation was as low as 30 to 50 percent. The breathing abnormalities during the awake state are not associated with bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. However, these events are frequently misdiagnosed as seizures.

These include focal, multifocal, and generalized epileptiform abnormalities, and the occurrence of rhythmic slow (theta) activity primarily in the frontal-central regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111513 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Evoked potentials typically demonstrate intact peripheral auditory and visual pathways and suggest dysfunction of central or higher cortical pathways.

Today it has limited diagnostic utility, but it may be employed as a tool to anticipate potential clinical problems and provide anticipatory guidance to parents. However, it is often difficult to discern precisely the transitions between stages. In addition, this system should <strong>not</strong> be used to predict life expectancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I consists of developmental arrest. The onset is between 6 to 18 months and it may last for many months. During this time there is less eye contact, reduced play, gross motor delays, nonspecific hand wringing, and decelerating head growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53558\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53558 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65333\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65333 \">picture 3</a>).

The onset is typically between one to four years of age. It may be so acute that parents can give a specific date after which their child was no longer normal. In other cases, the onset may be insidious. The duration is usually weeks to months. This phase is characterized by the loss of purposeful hand use and spoken language, and the onset during wakefulness of hand stereotypes and periodic breathing irregularities. Hand stereotypes are most frequently midline and hand wringing or hand washing in character. They occur incessantly during wakefulness but cease during sleep, and continue into adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67899 \">picture 5</a>). During this phase, many affected girls exhibit autistic behavior. Variable periods of unprovoked inconsolable crying or irritability and a disturbed sleep pattern are also common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50936 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III begins at 2 to 10 years of age, following the period of rapid deterioration. This phase lasts many years and is characterized by behavioral improvement and some improvement in hand use and communication skills, particularly by using &quot;eye pointing&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64268 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71900 \">picture 8</a>). Motor dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52460 \">picture 9</a>) and seizures are more prominent during this time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV consists of late motor deterioration and usually begins after the age of 10 years. It is characterized by increased rigidity, reduced mobility, dystonia, hypomimia, and bradykinesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78550\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78550 \">picture 10</a>). Some girls and women become non-ambulatory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62752\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62752 \">picture 11</a>) while others continue to ambulate well into adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78909 \">picture 12</a>). Cognitive function is stable and interpersonal communication may continue to improve. However, spoken communication is not regained. Seizures also often improve. Quadriparesis, scoliosis, and staring may be features of this stage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of RTT is based upon clinical characteristics; regression of acquired skills occurs in all affected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical RTT (see <a href=\"#H2830321633\" class=\"local\">'Typical RTT'</a> above) should be suspected in girls who have apparently normal development in the first 6 to 18 months of life followed by regression of purposeful hand skills and spoken language along with the onset of gait abnormalities and stereotypic hand movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Postnatal deceleration of head growth should also raise suspicion for RTT, although it does not occur in all individuals with typical RTT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical RTT (see <a href=\"#H1217387243\" class=\"local\">'Atypical RTT'</a> above) may be suspected in individuals who have many but not all of the clinical features of typical RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Careful clinical assessment should be combined with appropriate <span class=\"nowrap\">genetic/genomic</span> analysis. A clinical diagnosis of Rett syndrome or atypical Rett syndrome should not be made without specialist evaluation including comprehensive genetic testing. Detection of a pathogenic mutation in the MECP2 gene confirms the diagnosis in patients who fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria for RTT (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below), but this abnormality is not present in all cases. MECP2 mutations are found in approximately 95 percent of those with typical RTT and 20 percent of atypical cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, MECP2 variants have been identified in individuals who lack the clinical features of RTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some individuals with an MECP2 mutation who do not fulfill the criteria for either typical or atypical RTT may be classified as having a MECP2-related disorder.</p><p>The diagnosis of typical RTT in middle childhood is usually straightforward because of the distinctive presentation, although a history that confirms a period of regression must be present. However, the diagnosis in early infancy may be more difficult. The diagnosis cannot be made definitively in the young child with decreasing head growth and delayed gross motor skills until she reaches the regression phase with loss of hand skills and spoken language, onset of hand stereotypies, and gait abnormalities. The diagnosis can usually be made in an adult woman with mental retardation and typical signs, including the prominence of motor problems with progression from a hyperkinetic to a bradykinetic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,126,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,126,127</a>].</p><p>In various studies, several factors have been associated with a delayed diagnosis of RTT, including normal head size, presentation with less specific features (eg, scoliosis, bone fractures, self-abusive behavior, unusual stereotypic hand movements), age of onset of stereotypies, lack of regression of hand use or verbal language, and impaired acquisition of developmental milestones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,128,129</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for RTT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111747 \">table 1</a>), revised in 2010, are divided into main, exclusionary, and supportive categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rett-syndrome-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In the majority of patients with typical or atypical RTT, the disorder is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. A minority of patients have atypical RTT caused by mutations in CDLK5 or FOXG1 genes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H33403553\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenotype of RTT is divided into typical (classic) and atypical (variant forms). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classification and major features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The clinical picture of typical (classic) RTT is unique. Affected patients initially develop normally and then experience loss of speech and purposeful hand use and onset of stereotypic hand movement and gait abnormalities. Deceleration of head growth can be one of the first signs. Additional manifestations can include seizures, autistic features, intermittent breathing abnormalities, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, and sleep disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H2830321633\" class=\"local\">'Typical RTT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atypical RTT encompasses variants of RTT that have many but not all of the clinical features of typical RTT. The three defined RTT variants are the preserved speech, early-onset seizure, and congenital variants. (See <a href=\"#H1217387243\" class=\"local\">'Atypical RTT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the evaluation for suspected RTT, special attention should be paid to the timing of developmental milestones and the presence of a period of regression with loss of hand skills and spoken language.

Diagnostic criteria (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above) for typical RTT require a period of regression followed by recovery or stabilization, and fulfillment of all four main criteria (loss of purposeful hand skills, loss of spoken language, gait abnormalities, and stereotypic hand movements) and no exclusionary criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111747 \">table 1</a>).
