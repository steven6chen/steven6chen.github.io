Pheochromocytoma is a rare disorder that presents challenges for the anesthesiologist. By some estimates, 25 to 50 percent of hospital deaths of patients with unmanaged or unknown pheochromocytoma occur during induction of anesthesia or during operative procedures for other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since treatment of pheochromocytoma almost always includes surgical resection, most of these patients will require anesthesia.</p><p>Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the extra-adrenal autonomic ganglia and are indistinguishable from pheochromocytomas at the cellular level. They can secrete catecholamines and present clinically like pheochromocytomas, so the concerns for anesthesia for patients with paragangliomas are the same.</p><p>This topic will discuss the preoperative evaluation, intraoperative management, and postoperative care of patients who will undergo resection of pheochromocytoma. The diagnosis and presentation, epidemiology, and genetics of pheochromocytoma, as well as medical optimization prior to surgery, pheochromocytoma during pregnancy, and nonsurgical treatment of pheochromocytoma, are discussed separately.

Because of the rarity of pheochromocytoma, most data on the anesthetic management and perioperative outcomes have been reported in small case series that spanned many years. The following observational studies illustrate the complications seen in patients with known pheochromocytoma who present for resection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 108 resections performed at a single institution reported no intraoperative deaths, two intraoperative arrhythmias (which were not defined), and one postoperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another observational study of 143 cases reported no deaths or myocardial infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Twenty-five percent had sustained hypertension during surgery, and 14 percent experienced a systolic BP (SBP) &gt;220 mmHg for a mean duration of nine minutes. Four percent required prolonged postoperative endotracheal intubation. Significant risk factors for adverse perioperative events included large tumor size, increased levels of preoperative catecholamines, and longer duration of surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third single-institution observational study of 81 laparoscopic resections reported no deaths or myocardial infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Intraoperative hypertension (SBP &gt;170 mmHg) and hypotension (SBP &lt;90) occurred in 53 and 28 percent of patients, respectively. Tumor size over 6 cm correlated with longer surgical time, but not with increased BP lability.</p><p/><p>Risks are much higher for patients with unrecognized pheochromocytoma who undergo anesthesia for unrelated surgery. In this setting, the patient can present with unexplained severe hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse after induction of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or at any time during surgery (eg, after administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]).

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient must be evaluated for possible end organ damage caused by excess catecholamine secretion, and preoperative medical preparation should be started. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493012\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We assess patients with pheochromocytoma at least 7 to 14 days prior to resection to allow time for modification of treatment, if necessary. Prior to this evaluation, the endocrinologist will have titrated therapy aimed at minimizing the physiologic impact of catecholamine release. This preoperative medical therapy usually takes 10 to 14 days.</p><p>The focus of our evaluation includes an assessment of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End organ damage that may affect anesthetic management.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493019\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic triad of symptoms of pheochromocytoma consists of hypertension, headache, and sweating, though most patients with pheochromocytoma do not present with all three. Other, less common signs and symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, papilledema, weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, and constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>Some hereditary conditions are associated with pheochromocytoma (eg, von Hippel Lindau, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1). When patients with these conditions present for other surgical procedures, signs and symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma should be elicited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pheochromocytoma-in-genetic-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pheochromocytoma in genetic disorders&quot;, section on 'Familial pheochromocytoma'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with pheochromocytoma rarely present in extremis, with a condition termed pheochromocytoma crisis, or pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis. Such patients may have either hypertension or hypotension, hyperthermia (temperature &gt;40&deg;C), mental status changes, and other organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Emergency pheochromocytoma resection may be required, and mortality is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493026\"><span class=\"h3\">End organ damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the routine preoperative anesthesia history and physical examination, evaluation should focus on potential end organ damage resulting from excess catecholamine secretion. Excess catecholamines secreted by pheochromocytomas can cause pathophysiological changes in the cardiovascular and other systems, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103581 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Of these, damage to the cardiovascular system is the most likely to impact outcomes with anesthesia. Catecholamine excess can result in volume depletion, postural hypotension, organ or limb ischemia, aortic dissection, angina, myocardial infarction, acute or chronic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The goal of preoperative medical therapy is to control hypertension and reverse volume depletion. (See <a href=\"#H175493033\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Preoperative cardiac evaluation should include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate for possible ischemic changes and rhythm disturbances. ST and T wave changes suggestive of ischemia should resolve with preoperative medical preparation; if necessary, surgery should be delayed until active ischemia has resolved and arrhythmias are adequately controlled prior to elective surgery.</p><p>For most patients, a preoperative echocardiogram should be performed to assess ventricular function, chamber size, and wall motion. An echocardiogram may be required to rule out primary cardiac paraganglioma, which is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. A Holter monitor is rarely indicated as arrhythmias should resolve with preoperative medical preparation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493033\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative medical therapy aimed at minimizing the physiologic impact of catecholamine release is a key component of the care of a patient with a catecholamine-secreting neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493490\"><span class=\"h4\">Goals of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms. Preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade may prevent or reduce hypertensive crises during surgery for pheochromocytoma, allow intravascular volume expansion, and improve cardiac function in patients with catecholamine-induced myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. While this process is usually managed by an endocrinologist, the anesthesiologist should understand the regimen used and the goals of therapy, which are twofold (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of hypertension, including prevention of hypertensive crisis during surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalization of intravascular volume </p><p/><p>There is no universally accepted regimen, and clinical practice varies.

A high-sodium diet is usually incorporated to aid in the expansion of intravascular volume. Details of various regimens are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Preparation often takes between 10 and 14 days. Effectiveness of medical preparation is assessed by twice-daily orthostatic blood pressure (BP) measurements, typically aiming for a seated BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">120/80</span> mmHg, a standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) &ge;90 mmHg, and a heart rate between 60 and 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (bpm) seated and 70 to 80 bpm standing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175493953\"><span class=\"h4\">Impact on intraoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medications used for preoperative management of catecholamine excess have different properties that may impact the likelihood and management of perioperative hemodynamic changes.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade is the most commonly implemented strategy. Alpha blockade is initiated first, and for patients with tachycardia or arrhythmias, beta blockade is typically added cautiously several days before surgery. The beta-adrenergic blocker should <strong>never</strong> be started before the alpha blocker because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation can lead to a further elevation in BP. Calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>) are sometimes used to supplement combined alpha and beta blockade or as an alternative for patients with intolerable side effects from other regimens.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha-adrenergic blockade</strong> &ndash; Several different alpha-adrenergic blocking medications may be administered preoperatively for pheochromocytoma resection, and none is clearly superior to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These medications prevent or mitigate hypertension during surgery prior to clamp of the effluent venous drainage from the tumor, but they can cause hypotension after that point, when catecholamine secretion drops precipitously.

Postoperative concerns specific to pheochromocytoma resection include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemodynamic instability</strong> &ndash; In most cases, extended recovery room or intensive care stays are for hemodynamic monitoring. Transient postoperative hypotension is common due to downregulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, residual effects of long-acting antihypertensive medications, or hypovolemia. Fifty percent of patients remain hypertensive for one to three days after excision of pheochromocytoma; 75 percent of patients become normotensive after 10 days of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoglycemia </strong>&ndash; Hypoglycemia can occur intraoperatively or postoperatively because of a rebound increase in insulin secretion, as the catecholamine inhibition of insulin secretion is eliminated with tumor removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-adult-with-pheochromocytoma/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

Risks are much greater for patients who are found incidentally to have pheochromocytoma during unrelated surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1579512\" class=\"local\">'Perianesthetic risks and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation should include assessment for end organ damage from elevated catecholamines and confirmation of effective medical preparation for surgery. Medical preparation should include alpha-adrenergic blockade, beta blockade if necessary, and normalization of intravascular volume. (See <a href=\"#H1312136743\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H175493033\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pheochromocytoma resection can be divided into two phases of surgery based on ligation of the tumor blood supply (see <a href=\"#H514768079\" class=\"local\">'Stages of surgery'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Phase I (prior to ligation of the effluent vein) is often characterized by periods of hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias, particularly during endotracheal intubation, insufflation of the abdomen during laparoscopic procedures, and tumor manipulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Phase II (after ligation of the effluent vein) is often complicated by hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia is used for pheochromocytoma resection. A variety of techniques and medications can be used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
