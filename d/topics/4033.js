When vasculitis affects the vasa nervorum, the results are often critical ischemia to peripheral nerves and potentially profound clinical sequelae.</p><p>Vasculitic neuropathy is usually only one feature of a systemic condition that can involve the skin, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. As an example, the group of vasculitic disorders commonly associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA; ie, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA; Wegener's], microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA; Churg-Strauss]) often cause vasculitic neuropathy. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and mixed cryoglobulinemia are also prone to involve the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>In a minority of patients with vasculitic neuropathy, the peripheral nervous system vasculitis occurs in isolation. In this setting, the disorder is referred to as nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy or isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Even in the absence of frank systemic vasculitis, nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy can be a devastating illness, leading to severe functional disabilities from which some patients never recover fully. Because the regeneration of peripheral nerves may require months or years, the goal of therapy is to control the inflammation within the vasa nervorum as quickly as possible to prevent or minimize nerve damage.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations of vasculitic peripheral neuropathy. The diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding of the initial pathogenetic events in vasculitic neuropathy remains incomplete. The pathogeneses of different vasculitic disorders are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two well-established pathways leading to vasculitic nerve damage are immune complex deposition and cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune complex deposition &ndash; Immune complex deposition within the vessel walls activates monocytes to release proinflammatory cytokines, including those that stimulate neutrophil migration to the site of injury. The release of free radicals from neutrophils may contribute to nerve tissue damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Immune complex-mediated injury is particularly relevant to the pathophysiology of mixed cryoglobulinemia and at least some cases of polyarteritis nodosa, particularly those associated with hepatitis B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell-mediated immunity &ndash; Cell-mediated immunity occurs when antigen-presenting cells (including perhaps, in some cases, endothelial cells) present relevant antigens to circulating cytotoxic T cells. These interactions result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory mediators that cause neutrophils and lymphocytes to adhere to and destroy endothelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cell-mediated immunity is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated diseases, a group of disorders characterized by &quot;pauci-immune&quot; inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Immune complex and cell-mediated immunity pathways are not mutually exclusive. As an example, in a study of hepatitis C virus-related mixed cryoglobulinemia, which is associated with prominent immune complex deposition, expression of mRNA was markedly increased for various T cell inflammatory mediators, including interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, in nerve biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Additional factors are under investigation in vasculitic neuropathy, including the cytokine allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1), which appears to play a role in inflammatory nerve disease and in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inflammatory responses cause occlusion of the blood vessels that constitute the vasa nervorum. The histopathologic findings vary according to the particular type of disease causing the vasculitic neuropathy and the stage of therapy at which the biopsy is taken. Varying degrees of axonal loss occur, depending upon disease severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77201\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77201 \">picture 1</a>). Polymorphonuclear cells are present in the infiltrates of the vessel wall in primary necrotizing vasculitis, while in secondary vasculitis the inflammatory infiltrate is mainly composed of mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Chronic lymphocytic infiltration of the walls of blood vessels that supply affected peripheral nerves is typical of many diseases associated with vasculitic neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68618 \">picture 2</a>). In addition, eosinophilic infiltration of the vasa nervorum is present in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; Churg-Strauss) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55115\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55115 \">picture 3</a>), a disorder in which up to 80 percent of patients are affected by vasculitic neuropathy. A leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the vasa nervorum may be seen early in the course.</p><p>Histopathologic findings in vasculitic neuropathy include perivascular and transmural mononuclear cell infiltration of the epineural blood vessels. This inflammatory infiltrate, often comprised primarily of T cells and macrophages, may lead to fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessel wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81956\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81956 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many cases, particularly those in which immune complex deposition plays a primary role, demonstrate immunoglobulin and complement deposition within the vessel wall.</p><p>DNA microarray analysis is a powerful tool for simultaneous analysis and comparison of gene products expressed in normal and diseased tissues; it has been used to demonstrate that several different types of genes related to immunity and to the regulation of vascular cells are upregulated in patients with vasculitic neuropathy. In one study, this technique was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nerve biopsy samples of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitic neuropathy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; genes upregulated in VAS included IGLJ3, IGHG3, IGKC, and IGL, which all function in B-cell selection or antigen recognition of B cells. Other upregulated genes included chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CCR2, as well as CPA3, a mast cell carboxypeptidase. In a second study, gene expression profile analysis revealed that, in peripheral nerve vasculitis, a prominent activation of immune response-related genes, as well as genes involved in vascular proliferation, occurs, while genes inhibiting endothelial cell activation are down-regulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of nerve involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ischemic lesions accumulate randomly along the course of peripheral nerves. The clinical result is a pattern of damage to both sensory and motor nerves that is initially asymmetric, patchy, and distal. The longest nerves are affected first. Over time, the pattern may become more symmetric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75374 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Nerve tissue within the watershed area of nutrient arteries may be particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury. Myelinated fibers are most sensitive to ischemia; however, with disease progression, unmyelinated fibers are also damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy can be divided into neurologic and non-neurologic features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms such as pain, paresthesia, numbness, and weakness are the presenting symptoms of vasculitic neuropathy. Symptoms may have an abrupt onset or may progress insidiously. The three patterns of nerve injury observed in vasculitic neuropathy are mononeuritis multiplex, distal polyneuropathy, and radiculopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plexopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mononeuritis multiplex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the three types of presentation of vasculitic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex is the most specific for the diagnosis of vasculitis. Mononeuritis multiplex is defined as nerve damage in two or more named nerves in separate parts of the body. &quot;Wrist-drop,&quot; for example, is caused by infarction of the radial nerve, and &quot;foot-drop&quot; is caused by damage to either the sciatic or the peroneal nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59168\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59168 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Because nerve length affects the frequency of clinical involvement by vasculitic neuropathy and because the longest nerves in the body are affected first, foot-drop is the most common manifestation of mononeuritis multiplex. Patients are often unaware of dorsiflexion weakness until it is demonstrated by the examiner. Foot-drop may also be evident through observation of the patient in ambulation; patients with tibialis anterior weakness must raise their knee on the affected side high in order to avoid tripping over the weakened foot, leading to a &quot;foot-slapping&quot; gait.</p><p>Other peripheral nerves may be affected, including the tibial, ulnar, and median nerves. Nerve infarction eventually leads to muscle wasting, which, in many cases, is permanent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51613 \">picture 6</a>). If mononeuritis multiplex progresses, more nerves may become involved, eventually leading to a more symmetric or confluent appearance to the pattern of nerve dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distal, symmetrical polyneuropathy is more common in vasculitic neuropathy than was previously believed, and asymmetric presentations have been described. Electromyography with nerve conduction velocity testing often reveals greater asymmetry to the process than is appreciated on clinical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiculopathy and/or plexopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiculopathies and neural plexopathies have been documented in association with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Dermatomal sensory impairment is characteristic of radicular involvement. By contrast, symptoms or findings that cannot be localized to a single peripheral nerve or nerve root should raise suspicion of a brachial or lumbar plexopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H41\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Brachial plexopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lumbosacral plexopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-neurologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss are nonspecific features related to the effects of circulating cytokines and other biologic mediators. These symptoms are more likely to occur in patients with a systemic rather than nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific organ involvement beyond the peripheral nerves also may provide a clue to the presence of an underlying disorder. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable purpura or skin ulcers are found in primary vasculitides associated with small- or medium-vessel vasculitis (eg, hypersensitivity vasculitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA; Wegener's]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory tract involvement is consistent with some form of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (eg, destructive upper airway lesions in GPA; asthma, allergic rhinitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal polyps in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA; Churg-Strauss]; and alveolar hemorrhage in all forms).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal angina may signal the presence of medium-vessel mesenteric vasculitis, as found in PAN.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major forms of systemic disease that are associated with vasculitic neuropathy include both certain vasculitides and connective tissue disorders.

Those that involve arterioles and small- and medium-sized arteries are the types of vasculitis most frequently associated with neuropathy. By contrast, pure small-vessel forms of vasculitis, such as hypersensitivity vasculitis, and pure large-vessel forms of disease, such as Takayasu arteritis, are seldom, if ever, associated with vasculitic neuropathy. As a result, the occurrence of vasculitic neuropathy in patients with these conditions should trigger a reconsideration of the underlying diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">ANCA-associated vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral nervous system involvement is noted in approximately 15 percent of patients with GPA, 70 percent of those with MPA, and 80 percent of those with EGPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Some eventually develop vasculitis in other organs and are then diagnosed with a systemic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitic neuropathy results from inflammation in the blood vessel walls of the vasa nervorum. The three patterns of nerve injury in vasculitic neuropathy are mononeuritis multiplex, distal polyneuropathy, and radiculopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plexopathy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of nerve involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical result is typically a pattern of damage to both sensory and motor nerves that is asymmetric, patchy, and distal. The longest nerves in the body (those in lower extremities) are affected first. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitic neuropathy most often occurs in the context of a systemic disease, usually a form of vasculitis or a connective tissue disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Systemic disease associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less often, vasculitic neuropathy presents in an isolated fashion, a presentation called nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy or isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dyck PJ, Benstead TJ, Conn DL, et al.
