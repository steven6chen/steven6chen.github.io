Treatment can reverse most of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, although this must be done carefully to minimize the possibility of permanent hormone deficiency and treatment side effects.</p><p>This article discusses the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. The causes, symptoms, and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cushing's syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information about treatment of Cushing's syndrome is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CUSHING'S SYNDROME DUE TO MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When Cushing's syndrome is caused by glucocorticoids (like prednisone) that are taken for another medical condition (eg, asthma or rheumatoid arthritis), discontinuing the glucocorticoids will resolves symptoms. However, in most cases, the body has adapted to the presence of the glucocorticoids, and they must be tapered off gradually to allow the pituitary and adrenal glands to resume normal function.</p><p>Some conditions require prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. In this situation, an alternate plan for managing the signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF CUSHING'S DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When Cushing's syndrome results from a corticotropin (ACTH)-producing tumor of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease), treatment may include surgery, radiation, or medication to lower cortisol levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical removal of a small pituitary adenoma (benign tumor) is called transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The pituitary is located at the base of the brain. It is possible to access this area through the gums above the upper front teeth or the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63094 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Using special instruments, the surgeon makes an incision in one of these areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75464 \">figure 2</a>). The incision is extended through the sphenoid sinus, allowing the surgeon to see and remove the adenoma with an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera). This type of surgery permanently cures Cushing's syndrome in 60 to 70 percent of people.</p><p>Sometimes an adenoma cannot be identified; in these cases, some surgeons remove half of the pituitary gland (hemihypophysectomy); other surgeons remove most of the pituitary gland (85 to 90 percent, subtotal hypophysectomy), to be certain that the tumor has been removed.</p><p>The downside of removing gland is that it can reduce pituitary function and interfere with ovulation (in women) and sperm production (in men). Lifelong hormone replacement is often necessary after this surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173528877\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When pituitary surgery is unable to restore normal cortisol production, several drugs can be used to control cortisol production. Cabergoline, a drug used mostly to treat prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors, can normalize ACTH and cortisol production in approximately 30 percent of patients. Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasireotide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pasireotide</a> can normalize ACTH and cortisol in 20 to 25 percent of patients with Cushing's disease.</p><p>Mifepristone is a medication that can decrease the effects of excess cortisol on glucose, but its role on long-term therapy of Cushing's disease is not well known. Other drugs that block production of cortisol, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ketoconazole</a>, metyrapone, or mitotane, can also be used to reduce high levels of cortisol while waiting for more definitive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation can be a useful treatment when pituitary tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery. Radiation of pituitary tumors reduces cortisol levels in approximately half of adults and most children with Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma that makes ACTH). Because this cortisol-lowering effect takes time (3 to 24 months), medications that lower adrenal cortisol production may be given while waiting for the effects of radiation. These medications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ketoconazole</a> and metyrapone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenalectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical removal of the adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) is a final measure that is sometimes recommended if other treatments are not successful. It may be chosen earlier if the patient is extremely ill and the high cortisol levels need to be normalized immediately. Adrenalectomy stops excess cortisol production but requires that you begin lifelong daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics#H16\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Primary adrenal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ECTOPIC ACTH SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some people with corticotropin (ACTH)-producing, nonpituitary tumors found in other parts of the body, surgical removal of the tumor eliminates the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. These tumors are usually in the lung. When complete surgical removal is not possible, treatment with medications that reduce adrenal cortisol production (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ketoconazole</a> and metyrapone) or surgical removal of the adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) may be necessary to lower cortisol levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENAL GLAND TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenal tumors are usually treated with surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland, leaving the opposite adrenal gland for cortisol production. If the tumor is an adenoma (a benign tumor), surgery always cures the associated Cushing's syndrome.</p><p>If the tumor is a carcinoma (a cancerous tumor), surgery is the only way to cure the cancer; radiation, chemotherapy, and treatment with mitotane (a medication that is toxic to cortisol-producing cells) are usually required to lower cortisol levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma#H16810714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Mitotane monotherapy'</a>). After these treatments, daily adrenal hormone replacement is usually necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics#H16\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Primary adrenal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">NODULAR ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of nodular adrenal hyperplasia (a very rare disorder) usually requires surgical removal of both adrenal glands. Before surgery, medications that inhibit adrenal enzymes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ketoconazole</a> or metyrapone) can lower cortisol levels.</p><p>After surgery, daily adrenal hormone replacement is usually necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics#H16\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Primary adrenal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CUSHING'S SYNDROME DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cushing's syndrome is rare during pregnancy. The excess cortisol production is usually caused by an adrenal tumor, most often an adenoma (a benign tumor), although some patients have a pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although most of the excess cortisol does not cross the placenta and affect the fetus, untreated Cushing's syndrome poses a risk to pregnant women because it can lead to maternal complications such as high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, and it is associated with miscarriage and premature delivery.</p><p>When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an adrenal tumor or a benign pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease), surgical removal of the adrenal or pituitary gland can lower the abnormal cortisol levels without affecting the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If treatment removes the source of excess cortisol, most of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome disappear within 2 to 12 months. Osteoporosis begins to improve within six months and continues to improve over several years. With successful treatment, children with Cushing's syndrome can regain much of their lost bone density and growth. Some high blood pressure and glucose intolerance may persist. Although symptoms of excess cortisol on the brain (emotional, sleep, memory disturbances) usually improve, some conditions can linger even after cortisol levels have been lowered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2177\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
