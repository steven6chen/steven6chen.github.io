Vaccines are especially important for people with HIV. That's because people with HIV are at higher risk of infections than other people, and vaccines help prevent infections. But only some vaccines are safe and appropriate for people with HIV.</p><p>In general, people with HIV can get &quot;inactivated vaccines,&quot; which are vaccines that contain dead copies of a virus. People with HIV usually should <strong>not</strong> get &quot;live attenuated vaccines,&quot; which are vaccines that contain live but weakened copies of a virus. There are exceptions to this, though. For instance, some people with HIV can get the live attenuated vaccine to protect against shingles (called the zoster vaccine).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259099\"><span class=\"h1\">Which inactivated vaccines should I get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have HIV, ask your doctor which vaccines you need.</p><p>Adults with HIV usually need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flu vaccine &ndash; The flu can cause fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, or sore throat. The flu vaccine is also called the &quot;influenza vaccine,&quot; or the &quot;flu shot.&quot; People with HIV should get one dose of this vaccine every year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcal vaccine &ndash; Pneumococcus is a germ that can cause an infection of the lungs, ears, blood, or tissues around the brain. The &quot;pneumococcal vaccine&quot; is sometimes called the pneumonia vaccine. There are 2 types of the pneumococcal vaccine. People with HIV should get one of each type of vaccine between the ages of 19 and 64. Once they turn 65, they should get another dose of one of them if it has been more than 5 years since their last dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines &ndash; Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. Pertussis, also called &quot;whooping cough,&quot; is an infection that causes a severe cough. People with HIV should get vaccines against these 3 infections, which come in a single shot. After that, they should get vaccines against diphtheria and tetanus every 10 years, which also come in a single shot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine &ndash; HPV is a virus that can cause genital warts and some forms of cancer. People with HIV who are 26 years old or younger should get 3 doses of this vaccine if they have not already had it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B vaccine &ndash; The hepatitis B virus causes a serious form of liver disease. People with HIV should get 3 doses of this vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcus vaccine &ndash; Meningococcus is a germ that can cause a serious body-wide infection of the blood or an infection called meningitis, which affects the tissues around the brain. People with HIV who are 2 months or older should get the vaccine. The number and timing of vaccine doses depends on the person's age and if they have already had a dose of the vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This vaccine is especially important for men who have sex with men, if they live in or travel to a city that has had a meningitis outbreak (such as New York City).</p><p/><p>Depending on their situation, some adults with HIV might also need a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a>. The hepatitis A virus can cause a serious form of liver disease. People can get it from eating or drinking unclean food or water. This vaccine might be appropriate for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who use intravenous (IV) drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men who have sex with men</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who already have other forms of liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People with a bleeding disorder called hemophilia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who travel to certain parts of the world</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259114\"><span class=\"h1\">Which live vaccines should I get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have HIV, there are certain live vaccines you can get. But you can only get them if your T cell counts are above 200. (T cells are a type of cell in the immune system. HIV lowers the number of T cells in your body.)</p><p>These vaccines include the zoster vaccine (1 dose). This vaccine protects against shingles, a condition related to chickenpox that causes a painful, band-shaped skin rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259131\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to travel?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to travel, you will need to check with your doctor about which vaccines you might need based on where you are going. Some travel vaccines are safe for people with HIV, but others are not safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259146\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you start trying. There are certain vaccines that you will need to have before you get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259161\"><span class=\"h1\">Which side effects should I expect?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the vaccines mentioned here cause soreness in the arm that usually lasts about a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10259176\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-treatment-for-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Starting treatment for HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-hiv-after-unprotected-sex-or-needle-sharing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing HIV after unprotected sex or needle-sharing (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing opportunistic infections in HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: HIV and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
