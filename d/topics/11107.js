The O antigen is defined serologically and determined by the repeating polysaccharide chains that are part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) embedded in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. The H antigen is defined serologically by the antigenic specificity of the bacterial flagellum.</p><p>EHEC strains of <em>E. coli</em> contain specific virulence properties: lysogenic phage encoding one or more Shiga toxins (with or without a chromosomal pathogenicity island), and often an additional virulence plasmid. These strains are also referred to as Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>, or STEC. </p><p>In the United States, many EHEC strains are serotype O157:H7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Non-O157 serotypes have also been described in the United States and in other countries; infections due to non-O157 serotypes are estimated to account for approximately 60 percent of EHEC infections in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among 940 human non-O157 STEC isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) between 1983 and 2002, the most common serogroups were O26, O111, O103, O121, O45, and O145 (22, 16, 12, 8, 7, and 5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>In a Canadian review of cases of sporadic diarrhea, non-O157 strains caused severe illness comparable to illness caused by O157 (including hemolytic-uremic syndrome), but the frequency of bloody diarrhea was lower (42 versus 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In an outbreak of <em>E. coli</em> O111 among 341 individuals in Oklahoma in 2008, the rate of HUS was similar to that reported for <em>E. coli</em> O157 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Most cases occurred among adults, highlighting the importance of monitoring for complications of <em>E. coli</em> infection in patients of all ages and regardless of serotype. </p><p>From May to July 2011, a Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> strain, serotype O104:H4, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in Germany and 15 other countries, largely in travelers returning from northern Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The cause of this outbreak turned out not to be a standard EHEC strain, but instead an enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> O104:H4 strain that had acquired a bacteriophage-encoded Shiga toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], creating a hybrid <em>E. coli</em> strain.</p><p>Most EHEC isolates in the United States are susceptible to the standard antibiotics used for gram-negative infections, although a growing number are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, sulfa drugs, and beta-lactams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The O104:H4 outbreak strain in Europe had an extended spectrum beta-lactamase enzyme and was broadly resistant to antibiotics.

A complex series of genetic and molecular events follow the attachment of EHEC to intestinal epithelial cells. This sequence of events has been extensively investigated and is discussed below. </p><p>Both EPEC and EHEC secrete a variety of protein products (EspA, EspB, EspD, and EspF) following epithelial cell contact via a type III protein secretion system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. These secreted proteins directly enter the epithelial cell to which the bacterium is attached, triggering a variety of signals within the epithelial cell, including calcium and inositol triphosphate fluxes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. EspA encodes the structural filament of the type III system, and EspB helps generate the pore in the eukaryotic cell through which the other secreted proteins enter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>One of the bacterial proteins secreted via the type III system into the host cell is Tir, which subsequently appears in the host cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In the host cell membrane, Tir serves as the receptor for intimin, a protein located in the outer membrane of EHEC that is responsible for intimate adherence of the organism to the intestinal epithelial cell. The intimin-Tir interaction initiates a second wave of signal transduction in the epithelial cell, which leads to reorganization and localization of polymerized actin under the adherent bacterium, completing the attaching-effacing lesion.</p><p>In addition to Tir, intimin recognizes the eukaryotic protein nucleolin as a receptor on the epithelial cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Shiga toxin produced during infection appears to increase the expression of nucleolin, thus promoting increased adherence of EHEC to enterocytes.</p><p>The genes involved in inducing the attaching-effacing lesion, including the type III protein secretion system, the secreted effector molecules and their chaperones, intimin and Tir, are all encoded in a 35-41 kilobase-pair &quot;pathogenicity island&quot; that is missing en bloc in nonpathogenic strains of <em>E. coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Expression of the genes in the pathogenicity island (the locus of enterocyte effacement or LEE) is dependent upon the Ler regulatory protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], as well as the LuxS quorum sensing system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. One hypothesis is that expression of genes in the LEE can occur despite the low inoculum of EHEC because of an autoinducing signal produced by nonpathogenic <em>E. coli</em> already in the lower intestinal tract. In addition, EHEC sense the low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> concentration in the human large intestine, and this activates expression of the genes in the LEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The contribution of the attaching-effacing lesion to EHEC pathogenesis is not entirely clear, since not all EHEC strains have the pathogenicity island or produce the attaching-effacing lesion. It is possible that there are other mechanisms that allow EHEC to interact with intestinal epithelium and initiate disease. </p><p>The <em>E. coli</em> O104:H4 hybrid strain that caused the outbreak in 2011 in Germany presumably has colonization properties similar to enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> strains, but produced Shiga toxin to cause its distinctive clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

These toxins from EHEC belong to a larger Shiga toxin family, which includes the closely related Shiga toxin produced by <em>Shigella</em> <em>dysenteriae</em> type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There are two related types of Shiga toxins in EHEC defined serologically (Shiga toxin 1 and 2), as well as a number of subtypes of Shiga toxin 2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H440124159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Shiga toxins have an A:B5 structural motif. The A subunit is enzymatically active, and has a catalytic (A1) domain and a carboxy terminal A2 domain, which is responsible for the association of the A subunit with the B subunits. The B subunits form a pentamer that binds toxin to its receptor on eukaryotic cells, the glycolipid Gb3. Bound toxin is internalized in clathrin-coated pits by receptor-mediated endocytosis; the toxin then undergoes retrograde transport via the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane. During this transit, the A subunit is nicked by furin protease and the disulfide bond bridging the A1 and A2 fragments is reduced. The A1 fragment enters the cytosol, where it acts as an enzyme to cleave a specific adenine residue from the 28S rRNA in the 60S ribosomal subunit, halting protein synthesis and causing cell death.</p><p>Shiga toxins enter the systemic circulation and are found within polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], as well as platelets and monocytes. These intoxicated blood cells release microvesicles containing Shiga toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and these microvesicles evade the host immune system and are endocytosed by target endothelial cells, causing vascular damage, bloody diarrhea, and, in some patients, a prothrombotic state that precedes the hemolytic uremic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In the kidney, these microvesicles can be transferred from renal endothelial cells through the underlying basement membrane into podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells, causing the renal damage of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Expression of toxin receptors on endothelial cells is upregulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) and interleukin (IL)-1b; these cytokines are, in turn, released by the interaction of Shiga toxins with macrophages and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Shiga toxin may have a direct cytotoxic effect in the thalamus that may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurologic complications in hemolytic uremic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>A recombinant <em>E. coli</em> has been produced that expresses a mimic of the Shiga toxin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In vitro, the recombinant bacteria neutralized Shiga toxin, and mice that were fed the organism were protected from subsequent challenge with a usually fatal dose of Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em>.

Epidemiologic investigation of these outbreaks by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established that all of the patients had ingested ground beef from the same hamburger meat source prior to onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. A new serotype of <em>E. coli</em>, O157:H7, was isolated from the stool of ill patients and the implicated hamburger meat; the organism was not isolated from the stool of healthy controls.</p><p>The FoodNet survey by the CDC reports on the frequency of laboratory-confirmed causes of acute foodborne illnesses in 10 US states. According to the 2015 survey, there were 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">EHEC/STEC</span> infections overall reported per 100,000 people, approximately 40 percent due to <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 and the other 60 percent due to other STEC strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/26,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,59</a>]. It is estimated that STEC infection causes illness in approximately 75,000 patients per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, this approach has not completely prevented beef contamination. In 2002, for example, one plant issued a recall of 354,200 pounds of ground beef based on cultures growing <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In one county fair outbreak, cases were more likely than controls to have attended a dance in the building, to have handled sawdust from the floor, or to have eaten within the building. Isolates of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 from within the building matched isolates from cases on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identical strains could be isolated from sawdust in the building 42 weeks after the fair. These findings suggested that <em>E. coli</em> O157 had been introduced into the building, most likely via defecation by an infected cow, and that the organisms survived and perhaps multiplied in sawdust on the floor for several weeks. Contamination of the rest of the building may have occurred by airborne dispersion of bacteria.</p><p>The prevalence of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 in livestock at county and state fairs in 2002 was surveyed by examining fresh fecal specimens from cattle, swine, sheep, and goats along with fly pools (trapped live flies) at 32 county and state fairs in three states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. <em>E. coli</em> O157 was isolated from cattle (11 percent), swine (1 percent), goats and sheep (4 percent), and fly pools (5 percent). Environmental sampling performed at 20 fairgrounds 10 months after the 2002 livestock sampling (while fairgrounds were livestock-free) identified <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 in 0.6 percent of samples, all from beef barn environments. This study suggests that <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 is common among livestock at fairs and may persist in the environment after the fair.</p><p>Investigation of an outbreak of <em>E. coli</em> O111 among inmates of a Colorado prison suggested that inmates were infected through fecally contaminated clothing and other items that were brought into food preparation areas by other inmates employed at an onsite dairy where they had extensive cattle contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Since the initial recognition of severe bloody diarrhea due to a new serotype of <em>E. coli</em>, O157:H7, in the United States in 1982, outbreaks and sporadic infections have been attributed to EHEC worldwide. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> strains can be classified by their O and H antigens.

This strain was associated with a higher incidence of HUS than previous outbreaks.

The most important reservoir for <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 is the gastrointestinal tract of cattle. Risk of transmission is associated with ingestion of undercooked ground beef and other items that have been fecally contaminated.
