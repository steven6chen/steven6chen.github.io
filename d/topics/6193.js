In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight less than 1500 g), <em>Candida albicans</em> is the third most common cause of neonatal late onset sepsis (LOS), which occurs after the first 72 hours of life. This was illustrated in a multicenter study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network that evaluated 6956 VLBW infants (range of birth weight from 401 to 1500 g) admitted over a two-year period from 1998 to 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>C. albicans</em> was the causative agent in 6 percent of first episodes of LOS following Coagulase negative <em>Staphylococcus </em>(48 percent) and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (8 percent) in frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, <em>Candida parapsilosis</em> was isolated as the causative agent in 4 percent of the cases.</p><p>The incidence of<em> Candida</em> infections is greatest in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (ie, birth weights &lt;1000 g), as demonstrated by a study from the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system that included 130,523 patients admitted to 128 NICUs between 1995 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The overall incidence of <em>Candida</em> blood stream infections was 1.53 per 1000 patient-days among the infants admitted to the NICU.

Of note, similar decreases did not occur in the incidence of candidal infections in infants of higher birth weights. The explanation for this decline is unknown. </p><p/><p>In a retrospective study of 30,045 preterm neonates discharged from 11 NICUs in China (2009 to 2011), the overall incidence of invasive candidiasis was 0.74 cases per 100 discharges and among very low birth weight infants, the incidence was 3.42 cases per 100 discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter longitudinal study from Canada, the cumulative incidence rates of invasive candidiasis were 4.2, 2.2, and 1.5 percent for birth weight categories &lt;750 g, &lt;1000 g, and &lt;1500 g, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1909063734\"><span class=\"h2\">Trend for Candida infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of candidiasis in NICUs in the United States appears to be decreasing, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from NNIS, the overall incidence of <em>Candida </em>central line-associated bloodstream infections decreased over the study period from 1999 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The rate of infection due to <em>C. albicans</em>, which remained the most common cause of infection (50 percent), decreased from 0.9 to 0.2 percent, and the incidence for other <em>Candida</em> species decreased from 0.4 to 0.1 percent. A decrease in <em>C. albicans</em> infections was observed across all birth weight categories, and a similar decrease was seen for non-albicans <em>Candida </em>spp in all infants, except in neonates with a birth weight between 1501 and 2500 g.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter study from the Pediatrix Medical Group, the overall incidence of invasive candidiasis decreased from 3.6 to 1.4 episodes per 1000 patients from 1997 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This was examined by a study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network of 3702 infants from 12 NICUs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For each center, the average number of days of administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics per patient was calculated. In this study, the incidence of candidiasis ranged from 2.4 to 20.4 percent among the 12 centers. The average number of days of antibiotic use correlated with the incidence of invasive candidal infections (correlation coefficient 0.7). These results suggest that increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics raises the risk of candidal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SITE OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive blood stream infections are the most common neonatal presentation of <em>Candida</em> infections.

Breastfeeding can result in transmission of <em>Candida</em> from the maternal skin to the oral mucosa of the infant, especially in mothers with <em>Candida</em> mastitis.</p><p>Although neonatal <em>Candida</em> colonization is most commonly the result of vertical transmission, both vertical and horizontal transmissions contribute to neonatal colonization. This was illustrated in a prospective study of 76 mothers who gave birth to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight below 1500 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Maternal cultures were obtained within 24 hours of delivery and infant cultures were obtained weekly for 12 weeks or until death or discharge. <em>C. albicans </em>was isolated from 46 mothers (61 percent) and 27 infants (36 percent). Eighteen of the 27 infants were born to a <em>C. albicans </em>colonized mother (67 percent). DNA fingerprinting performed on isolates from colonized <span class=\"nowrap\">mother/infant</span> pairs, in which the infants were colonized by <em>C. albicans </em>by one week of age, demonstrated identical banding patterns in 11 of the 13 pairs (85 percent) confirming vertical transmission.</p><p>Several outbreaks of <em>C. albicans </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>], <em>C. parapsilosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], <em>C. tropicalis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and <em>C. lusitaniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] infection have been reported due to horizontal transmission from health care staff. In particular, the primary mode of transmission for <em>C. parapsilosis</em> is horizontal from health care workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/19,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,33</a>].

In very low birth weight infants (birth weight below 1500 g), <em>Candida albicans</em> is the third most common cause of neonatal late onset sepsis, which occurs after the first 72 hours of life. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. albicans</em> is the most commonly isolated<em> Candida</em> species (60 percent) followed by <em>C. parapsilosis</em> (34 percent). Other less common species include <em>C. tropicalis</em>, <em>C. lusitaniae</em>, <em>C. glabrata</em>, and <em>C. krusei</em>. Neonatal infections caused by nonalbicans species occur at a later age and are more likely to be acquired from the hospital staff or environment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive blood stream infections are the most common neonatal presentation of<em> Candida </em>infections. Other candidal infections include meningitis, endocarditis, abscesses in the kidneys, spleen and liver, endophthalmitis, skin infections, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Site of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidal infections in the neonate are usually dependent upon transmission of the organism from a carrier, colonization of the infant by the organism, and penetration of the organism through the host epithelial barriers. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most candidal infections are due to vertical transmission from the mother. In some cases, infections, particularly those due to <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, are the result of horizontal transmission from health care staff or hospital environment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> generally colonizes the skin, gastrointestinal tract, lower female genital tract, intertriginous areas, and the foreskin of uncircumcised males. In the neonate, colonization usually precedes invasive fungal infection. The rate of colonization increases with decreasing birth weight. Almost two-thirds of extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight less than 1000 g) are colonized by six weeks of age. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants admitted to the NICU, especially premature infants, are at increased risk for candidal infections because of the immaturity of their immune and host epithelial protection, compromise of their epithelial protection with invasive procedures (eg, intubation, central venous catheters, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery), and factors that promote increased density of candidal colonization (eg, administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for invasive candidiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic candidiasis is a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity with reported mortality rates of 13 to 50 percent.
