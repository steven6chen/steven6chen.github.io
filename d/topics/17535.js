It should also include advice about behavioral precautions and environmental exposures.</p><p>Fewer than half of travelers to high-risk regions seek travel advice, and many clinicians are not aware of the most appropriate advice regarding preventive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, travelers returning to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives are less likely to seek advice since they do not realize they are at risk for illness associated with travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As a result, preventable systemic illnesses such as malaria and typhoid fever occur more commonly in this risk group than among other travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Issues related to advice for travelers will be reviewed here.

The most common syndromic diagnoses among travelers include gastrointestinal, febrile, and dermatologic illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Asia and sub-Saharan Africa were the most common regions where illnesses were acquired (32 and 25 percent). Approximately 40 percent of ill travelers reported pretravel medical visits. Travelers visiting friends and relatives in their country of origin had a disproportionately high burden of serious febrile illness and very low rate of advice prior to travel.</p><p>In addition to variability of health risks according to destination, travel duration, type of travel, activities undertaken, specific traveller characteristics (including age and gender), and other factors influence the chances of presenting for healthcare with various infections. For example, women are proportionately more likely than men to present after travel with diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, or adverse reactions to medication, whereas they are proportionately less likely to have vector-borne diseases or sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETRAVEL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical consultation should be obtained at least one month before travel to allow time for thorough evaluation and for immunizations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for travel&quot;</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Microbiology, epidemiology, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22624013\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral precautions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22624029\"><span class=\"h3\">Food and water</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is prudent to be careful of food and water in areas where sanitation and personal hygiene may be poor. Hands should always be washed before eating. Infections transmissible by contaminated food and water include travelers' diarrhea and hepatitis A and E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Transmission of parasitic infections can also occur.</p><p>In such circumstances, travelers should avoid consuming tap water, ice made from tap water, and raw foods rinsed with tap water. Chlorination kills most bacterial and viral pathogens, but protozoal cysts of <em>Giardia lamblia</em> and <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> and oocysts of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> may survive.</p><p>Boiled, treated, or bottled water may be consumed. Carbonated beverages, beer, wine, and drinks made with boiled water are safe. Produce that is peeled by the traveler may be eaten. Food should be eaten well-cooked and while still hot. Unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked fish or meat should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550184342\"><span class=\"h3\">Vector avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travelers to areas with malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and other vector-borne diseases should receive instructions regarding methods to prevent bites from mosquitoes. These measures are also generally effective for reducing risks of bites from sandflies, ticks, and other insects. Measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding outdoor exposure during mosquito feeding time (for malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus, this is between dusk and dawn; for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever, this is during the daytime)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing clothing that reduces the amount of exposed skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using an insect repellant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating fabrics (including clothes) with insecticides</p><p/><p>Other factors and details of appropriate repellants and insecticides are discussed separately.

The importance of good hand hygiene should be emphasized and appropriate vaccinations considered. Tuberculosis is also an important respiratory pathogen among travelers to endemic areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Swimming and beaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swimming in fresh water should be avoided in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent. Even short exposures to infested water during rafting or swimming are sufficient for transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Swimming in chlorinated or salt water is safe. Rafting and other water-related activities, including exposure to flood waters, can also result in exposure to leptospirosis.</p><p>Travelers also should be cautioned about the risks of walking barefoot or in loose-fitting footwear on beaches, on soil, or in water that may be contaminated with human or canine feces. Such exposure may lead to contact with hookworm or <em>Strongyloides</em> larvae. Acquisition of the larvae can cause cutaneous larva migrans, hookworm, or strongyloidiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-related-cutaneous-larva-migrans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hookworm-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hookworm infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strongyloidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strongyloidiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Travelers should also wear sunglasses and sunblocking agents with ultraviolet A and B protection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H545876359\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travelers should be warned against approaching animals and should be advised regarding potential risks from animal bites and scratches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/travel-advice/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

If possible, competent medical facilities should be identified in destination countries, and all medications should be carried with the traveler. Some countries will not allow entry to individuals with HIV or those found to be carrying antiretroviral medications; consular offices for countries should be checked prior to travel.
