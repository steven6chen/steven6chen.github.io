It is the most commonly used pulmonary function test and is useful in the evaluation of patients with respiratory symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, wheeze) or risk factors for respiratory disease (eg, smoking, occupational exposures, family history).</p><p>In the office setting, spirometry is typically used to detect, confirm, and monitor obstructive airway diseases (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In this setting, the clinician must be knowledgeable about issues related to equipment, performance of the forced expiratory maneuver, and interpretation of the data to obtain reliable and clinically useful information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. International guidelines for performance of office spirometry have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The performance of spirometry in the office setting will be reviewed here. More general issues related to pulmonary function tests, the interpretation of flow volume loops, and the technique of bronchoprovocation testing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of spirometers manufactured since 1990 are accurate, although some flow-sensing office spirometers can produce falsely high results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The National Lung Health Education Program (NLHEP) has published guidelines for office spirometers and has a list of features (eg, graphic output) that should be available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>To avoid cross-contamination between patients when using permanent flow sensors, it is preferable to employ single use disposable flow sensors that practically eliminate the risk of inhalational cross contamination. Disposable one-way mouthpieces may also be used; otherwise, patients should be instructed not to inhale from the spirometer prior to forced exhalation maneuvers. Volume sensing spirometers maintain accuracy over many years, but are more difficult to clean and are rarely used for office spirometry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Office spirometers should accurately measure the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced expiratory volume in six seconds (FEV<sub>6</sub>), and forced vital capacity (FVC) and also provide quality checks and error messages.</p><p>In addition to internal calibration performed by the device, daily calibration checks with a three liter syringe are recommended, since permanent flow sensors can become clogged with secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When performing a calibration check, the three liter syringe should be discharged into the spirometer three times. The volumes read by the machine should be within 3.5 percent of three liters. If the spirometer reading remains outside these limits after replacing the flow sensor, the device should be removed from use until checked by the manufacturer.</p><p>It is also essential that the nurse or technician enter correct values for age, height, and gender, as these values are used to generate the appropriate predicted values for the individual patient. Height should be measured with shoes off, preferably using a stadiometer, rather than relying on the patient's stated height. Percent predicted values that are higher or lower than expected are a clue that an incorrect age or height value may have been entered. Waist circumference should also be measured because abdominal obesity is a common cause of a mildly low FVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are usually seated during spirometry, unless otherwise noted. Nose clips or manual occlusion of the nares help to prevent air leakage through the nasal passages, although spirometry can be performed without nasal occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The deep inhalation should occur before the mouthpiece is placed in the mouth. Immediately after the deep inhalation, the mouthpiece is placed just inside the mouth between the teeth. The lips should be sealed tightly around the mouthpiece to prevent air leakage during maximal forced exhalation. Exhalation should last at least 6 seconds.</p><p>The patient is allowed to rest for several seconds and the procedure is repeated. Usually, three maneuvers are performed, although additional tests may be needed if one or more of the curves are unacceptable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COACHING THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important task of the nurse or technician is to obtain maximal, reproducible efforts from the patient.</p><p>Even with the use of accurate instruments, office spirometry results may be misleading if the patient's efforts are submaximal. Unlike most other medical tests in which the patient remains passive, accurate spirometry results require significant exertion on the part of the patient.</p><p>The technician must instruct and encourage the patient to perform the breathing maneuvers in three phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55460\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55460 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 1: Coach the patient to take as deep a breath as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 2: Loudly prompt the patient to blast out the air into the spirometer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 3: Encourage the patient to continue exhaling for at least six seconds (three seconds for children)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ADEQUACY OF TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adequate test usually requires three acceptable and reproducible forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers. The clinician and technician must learn to recognize the patterns of acceptable and unacceptable efforts, since poorly performed maneuvers often mimic disease patterns. Detection of poorly performed maneuvers requires direct inspection of both flow-volume curves and volume-time spirograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57832 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>An acceptable maneuver requires a sharp peak in the flow curve and an expiratory duration greater than six seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65057 \">figure 3</a>). Two or three acceptable maneuvers should be available for analysis.</p><p>Reproducibility is determined by comparing the FVC values of the maneuvers. The two highest values for FVC should be within 0.15 L of each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. Similarly, the two highest values for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) should be within 0.15 L of each other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All tracings from the forced expiratory maneuvers should be examined for acceptability and reproducibility, according to the criteria mentioned above. The study should then be classified as normal, borderline, or abnormal, the latter showing either an obstructive or a restrictive pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65057 \">figure 3</a>). The severity of any obstructive impairment is then assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72469 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Forced expiratory volume in one second'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Forced vital capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forced vital capacity (FVC) (also known as the forced expiratory volume) is the maximal volume of air exhaled with a maximally forced effort from a position of full inspiration and is expressed in liters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The highest FVC from the three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers is used for interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The FVC may be reduced by suboptimal patient effort, airflow limitation, restriction (eg, from lung parenchymal, pleural, or thoracic cage disease), or a combination of these. An approach to the interpretation of abnormal values is provided in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72469 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The specific values assigned to mild, moderate, and severe disease vary among the different guidelines; we have included in the figure the ones that we find most consistent for predicting the degree of impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. In general, a moderately or severely low FVC needs further evaluation with full pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The slow vital capacity (SVC) is the maximal volume of air exhaled after a maximal inspiration, but without a forced effort. The SVC is rarely measured outside of hospital-based pulmonary function labs. For normal subjects, the slow and forced vital capacities are very close, whereas patients with airflow limitation tend to have a much lower FVC than SVC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;, section on 'Spirometry'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Forced expiratory volume in six seconds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forced expiratory volume in six seconds (FEV<sub>6</sub>) is sometimes used as a surrogate for FVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>]. The FEV<sub>6</sub> has the advantage of being more reproducible than the FVC and less physically demanding for the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Forced expiratory volume in one second</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation that follows a full inspiration, expressed in liters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The FEV<sub>1</sub> reflects the average flow rate during the first second of the FVC maneuver. The FEV<sub>1</sub> is the most important spirometric variable for assessment of the severity of airflow obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72469 \">figure 4</a>). The highest FEV<sub>1</sub> from the three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers is used for interpretation, even if it does not come from the maneuver with the highest FVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In patients with asthma, the FEV<sub>1</sub> declines in direct and linear proportion with clinical worsening of airways obstruction, and it increases with successful treatment of airways obstruction. The FEV<sub>1</sub> should be used for determining the degree of obstruction (mild, moderate, or severe) and for serial comparisons when following patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>The measured FEV<sub>1</sub> is usually expressed as a percent of the predicted value for determination of normality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72469 \">figure 4</a>). The lower limit of normal (LLN) FEV<sub>1</sub> is more accurately defined by the fifth percentile of healthy never-smokers, instead of the traditional 80 percent of predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The reference equations used by most spirometry software for determining predicted values in North America are derived from the NHANES III study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. Reference&nbsp;equations from the Global Lung Function Initiative, which assessed healthy individuals age 3 to 95 years across ethnic and geographic groups in 26 countries, may also be used and can be applied to both pediatric and adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These reference equations are endorsed by the American Thoracic Society, the American College of Chest Physicians, the European Respiratory Society, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Respiratory Science, the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, and the Asian Pacific Society for Respirology. They are becoming more widely available as an option in spirometry software. &#160;</p><p>As a rough guideline, the predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> for a 50 year-old of average height is about 4 L for a man and 3 L for a woman. When predicted values have not been calculated, patients with severe COPD generally have an FEV<sub>1</sub> less than one liter, while those with moderate COPD have an FEV<sub>1</sub> between 1 and 1.5 liters. It is unusual for patients with COPD to have dyspnea due to airflow obstruction when the FEV<sub>1</sub> is greater than 50 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting reference values for pulmonary function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ratio of FEV1/FVC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio is the fraction of the forced vital capacity that can be exhaled in the first second. It is the most important parameter for detecting airflow limitation in diseases like asthma and COPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72469 \">figure 4</a>). However, once it has been determined that a patient has airways obstruction, the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio is not useful for gauging severity of disease, since the FVC also tends to decrease with increasing obstruction. The FEV<sub>1</sub>, not the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio, should be used to monitor patients with asthma or COPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of the fifth percentile LLN for FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> to detect airway obstruction reduces the misclassification associated with using a fixed threshold of 0.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23-25</a>].</p><p>When FVC maneuvers are routinely stopped after six seconds, the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FEV<sub>6</sub></span> should replace the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The advantages of the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FEV<sub>6</sub></span> include less frustration for the patient and technician trying to achieve an end-of-test plateau, less chance of syncope, shorter testing time, and better repeatability, without loss of sensitivity or specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/18,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27-29</a>].

Physiologists have searched for a test that is more sensitive than the FEV<sub>1</sub> for detection of airflow obstruction in its early stages. None has proven to be as reliable as the index obtained by dividing the FEV<sub>1</sub> by the FVC. The forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of the FVC (also known as FEF25-75 or maximal mid-expiratory flow rate) should not be used to detect &quot;small airways disease&quot; in adults, due to poor reproducibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing the best values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Report the highest FVC and the highest FEV<sub>1</sub> from three spirometric maneuvers, even if they are derived from different maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow-volume loops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flow-volume loop is a plot of inspiratory and expiratory flow (on the Y-axis) against volume (on the X-axis) during the performance of maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirometry has limited ability to detect mild or early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in smokers, since airway obstruction predicts only about 10 percent of the variability in the subsequent decline in lung function in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal spirometry results have little if any value in prompting smokers to quit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with asthma, normal airflow at the time of office visits does not exclude serious airflow obstruction at other times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with early interstitial lung disease or sarcoidosis may have normal spirometry and need further testing of gas transfer with a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exercise oximetry to identify the cause of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>Misclassification rates due to suboptimal spirometry performance or interpretation are relatively high in the office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/6,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35</a>]. Among eight general practices, rates for successfully meeting American Thoracic Society (ATS) quality standards were below 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, continuous quality review and feedback to nurses and technologists performing office spirometry are necessary and results should be verified by repeat testing in a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) laboratory when important clinical decisions will be made based on the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spirometry is a low risk procedure and has few side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-spirometry/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. During the test, some patients may experience dizziness. The forced expiratory maneuver causes an increase in the pressure in the chest, abdomen, head, and eyes. In general, patients who have recently (eg, less than six weeks) had abdominal, intracranial, or eye surgery or a pneumothorax should not perform spirometry, although data are limited.</p><p>Spirometry requires exertion and should be avoided in patients with unstable angina or a recent myocardial infarction.</p><p>Rarely, performance of a forced expiratory maneuver will precipitate acute bronchoconstriction. This seems more likely to occur when a patient's asthma or COPD is poorly controlled.
