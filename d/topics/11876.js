However, there are varying degrees of bleeding risk associated with anticoagulation and not all individuals are candidates for this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Some nonpharmacologic strategies to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation, such as radiofrequency catheter ablation, have not been proven to reduce the risk of embolic stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the usual source for clot that embolizes. (See <a href=\"#H3502524461\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> below.) Percutaneous approaches, often referred to as LAA exclusion procedures, that mechanically prevent embolization of LAA thrombi have been developed and tested and are discussed in this topic. In addition, some patients undergoing cardiac surgery for reasons such as valve replacement or repair or coronary artery bypass graft surgery are candidates for LAA exclusion at the time of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1136760403\" class=\"local\">'Patients undergoing cardiac surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3502524461\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF), the vast majority of thrombus material is located within or involves the left atrial appendage (LAA). The intense fibrosis and inflammation seen in the left atrium of patients with AF, which are likely predisposing factors to thrombus formation, are particularly intense in the LAA. In addition, the fibrillating LAA is the only area within the left atrium that is comprised of pectinate muscle and can create an appropriate milieu for blood stasis and thrombus formation. It is estimated that 90 percent of left atrial thrombi are located in the LAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Other experts, particularly those outside the United States, recommend the device for patients who cannot take oral anticoagulation. Many of these patients are placed on dual antiplatelet therapy for up to six months postprocedure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous LAA occlusion'</a> below.) </p><p>The role of surgical procedures to prevent embolization from the LAA in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PERCUTANEOUS LAA OCCLUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For atrial fibrillation (AF) patients not undergoing open heart surgery (see <a href=\"#H1136760403\" class=\"local\">'Patients undergoing cardiac surgery'</a> below) who have indications (see <a href=\"#H426395008\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above) for long-term oral anticoagulation but who are suboptimal candidates, we consider referral for percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Among the available devices, we prefer the WATCHMAN device, as it has been shown to have comparable efficacy and safety to long-term oral anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolization. There are other devices with European CE Mark approval but no randomized controlled trial to support their use. </p><p>Occlusion of the LAA using percutaneous, catheter-based methods was first performed in 2001 with the PLAATO device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although early experience with this device was promising, this device was removed from development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The next dedicated device designed for LAA occlusion was the WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Plymouth, MN), followed by the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (St Jude Medical, MN). Both these devices are the leading implanted LAA endovascular devices worldwide but the Watchman device is the only occlusion device approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Other endovascular devices are available or in development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105504 \">table 1</a>). These devices are implanted with a similar approach, requiring a transseptal puncture from a femoral venous access to enable device implant into the LAA from a purely endovascular approach. An alternative percutaneous approach requires transpericardial (epicardial) access for LAA closure, and examples of such devices (several that require surgical thoracotomy) are listed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105505 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

It is a self-expandable nitinol cage deployed in the LAA using a transseptal approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61636\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61636 \">figure 1</a>). This device is covered by a layer of permeable polyethylene terephthalate (PTFE) membrane, which is endothelialized within 45 days in dog models. It comes in five sizes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105504 \">table 1</a>) and has 10 fixation anchors to aid device stability. </p><p>The WATCHMAN device was evaluated in two randomized trials (PROTECT AF and PREVAIL) in patients with nonvalvular AF eligible for oral anticoagulation. PROTECT AF was a noninferiority trial in which 707 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either the device or to long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (international normalized ratio 2 to 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Inclusion criteria allowed for patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF and all patients had a CHADS2 score &ge;1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61615\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61615 \">table 3</a>). Device implantation was successful in 91 percent of all patients in whom it was attempted. Post-implantation, patients were continued on warfarin for 45 days, followed by switching warfarin to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> to six months, followed by aspirin alone indefinitely. The composite primary efficacy end point included stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death; the primary safety end point was a composite of major bleeding, pericardial effusion, procedure-related stroke, and device embolization. </p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a mean follow-up of 18 months, the primary efficacy event rate was similar in the intervention and control groups (3.0 versus 4.9 events per 100 patient years, respectively; rate ratio 0.62, 95% Bayesian credible interval 0.35-1.25). After a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, the primary efficacy event rates were 3.0 and 4.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

There was also a 60 percent relative risk reduction of cardiovascular death with WATCHMAN, which was predominantly driven by a significant reduction in hemorrhage stroke (rate ratio 0.15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p>Three subsequent reports from PROTECT AF have increased our understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of the WATCHMAN device:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes were compared between the 542 patients in the randomized study and 460 patients in the nonrandomized Continued Access Protocol registry who underwent WATCHMAN implantation after the randomized trial was completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There was a significant decline in the rate of procedure or device-related safety events within seven days compared with those in the randomized trial (3.7 versus 7.7 percent, respectively).

At 12 months, patients treated with the closure device had improvement in health-related quality-of-life measures while these measures declined among patients treated with warfarin.</p><p/><p>The PREVAIL study was mandated by the United States FDA to further evaluate the safety profile and confirm the efficacy of WATCHMAN for regulatory approval. This study randomly assigned 407 patients in a 2:1 ratio to WATCHMAN or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. Study inclusion criteria were CHADS<sub>2</sub> score &ge;2, or CHADS<sub>2</sub> = 1, if &ge;1 of the following was present: female &ge;75 years-old, left ventricular ejection fraction 30 to 34.9 percent, age 65 to 74 with diabetes or coronary artery disease, or age &ge;65 with documented congestive heart failure.<strong> </strong>Antithrombotic regimen post-implantation was similar to PROTECT AF.

(See <a href=\"#H426395008\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) This device also received CE Mark approval in 2005 in Europe. These patients must be able to tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for at least six weeks after the device is implanted and cannot have LAA clot present at the time of implantation. &#160; &#160;</p><p>LAA closure procedures have been evaluated in patients with absolute contraindications to oral anticoagulation. The use of WATCHMAN in such patients was evaluated in a prospective multicenter nonrandomized ASAP study, which treated 150 patients with contraindication to anticoagulation (CHADS<sub>2</sub> score &ge;1) with WATCHMAN and six months of a thienopyridine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>) as well as lifelong <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. During a mean duration of follow-up of 14.4 months, the primary efficacy outcome of all-cause stroke or systemic embolism occurred at a rate of 2.3 percent per year and ischemic stroke occurred at a rate of 1.7 percent per year. This rate was lower than predicted rates for CHADS<sub>2</sub>-matched cohorts of individuals taking either aspirin (7.3 percent) or clopidogrel (5.0 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization#H1052522978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p>Data from a large prospective multicenter registry have been published, reflecting real-world experience with the WATCHMAN device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The EWOLUTION study enrolled 1021 patients at high risk for stroke (mean CHADS-VASc score 4.5).

In this study, 62 percent of patients were deemed unsuitable for oral anticoagulation by their physicians. Thus, only 27 percent were treated with oral anticoagulation as post-implant antithrombotic therapy; the remainder were on dual (59 percent) or single (7 percent) antiplatelet therapy, or no antithrombotic therapy (6 percent). At one-year follow-up, the ischemic stroke rate was 1.1 percent, which represented 84 percent reduction compared with historical estimate based upon CHADS-VASc score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

This device is constructed of nitinol mesh, consisting of a proximal left atrial disk and a distal LAA lobe connected by a short waist. Both the lobe and disk have a Dacron polyester mesh sewn in by hand. The lobe contains six pairs of stabilizing wires designed to increase stability within the appendage. This device is shorter than the WATCHMAN device and may be more advantageous in individuals with short appendages. The second generation Amplatzer Cardiac Plug device (Amulet) received CE Mark in 2013, and has significant advances, including wider lobe and more stabilizing wires (up to 10 pairs) for improved device stability, and larger lobe size to occlude larger appendages.</p><p>This device has been evaluated in observational studies. The largest was a pooled experience from 22 European and Canadian centers and included 1047 patients. Procedural success was 97.3 percent, and there were 5 percent periprocedural major adverse events. One-year all-cause mortality was 4.2 percent (none were device related).

Unlike WATCHMAN, the WaveCrest is covered by a foam layer on the LAA side and PTFE on the side facing the left atrium. It has several anchors along the LAA side and is designed to be separately deployed from the lobe. This device is meant to be deployed quite proximally in the LAA, rather than deep within the structure. Thus, this device is another alternative to the WATCHMAN device if the LAA is too small to accommodate deeper devices.

Its use for LAA closure is &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; in the United States.</p><p>Unlike the endovascular devices, the LARIAT system requires access to both the endocardial and the epicardial space. A magnetic guide is placed within the LAA to allow the epicardially placed lasso to tie off the LAA. Patients who have had prior cardiac surgery or unusual LAA anatomy are not candidates for this procedure.</p><p>In a single-site study of 89 relatively low-risk patients with AF, the placement of the LARIAT device was successful in 96 percent and there were no associated complications due to the device (there were three access-related complications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Complete closure was confirmed in 95 percent at one and three months. No late strokes thought to be embolic were documented. However, subsequent multicenter results from the United States showed higher periprocedural complication rates. The retrospective series of 154 patients reported by the United States Transcatheter LAA Ligation Consortium showed procedural success of only 86 percent, with major complication of 9.7 percent.

However, pericardial effusion requiring drainage was 20 percent, perforation of the LAA occurred in 9 percent, and 17 percent had pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In July of 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication stating that cases of death and complications such as laceration or perforation of the heart or complete LAA detachment from the heart associated with the use of LARIAT had been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These real-world data raised concerns about the procedural safety of this device. Patients being considered for this procedure in the United States are typically those with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation or those who have anatomies that are unstable for endovascular closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2986110994\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AFTER DEVICE IMPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients who receive the WATCHMAN device, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for 45 days, followed by switching warfarin to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (plus aspirin) out to six months. We then discontinue clopidogrel and continue aspirin alone indefinitely. This protocol is based on that used in the PROTECT-AF trial. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'WATCHMAN device'</a> above.)</p><p>However, in patients with absolute contraindications to oral anticoagulation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is often used post-procedure for six months, as was carried out in the ASAP study, or for one to three months for patients at very high risk of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'WATCHMAN device'</a> above.)</p><p>We obtain a post-procedural transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) between one and six months to screen for a peri-device leak or device associated thrombus. Most often, we obtain the TEE between one and six months post-procedure. A peri-device leak of &lt;5 mm is of no known clinical significance, whereas one &ge;5 mm will lead to a much longer period of oral anticoagulation (an additional six months). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022978410\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high-quality evidence that can be used to formulate recommendations regarding endocarditis prophylaxis after placement of a left atrial appendage occlusion device. We generally recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for up to six months after device placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis#H22969468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136760403\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical ligation or amputation of the left atrial appendage (LAA) can be, and often is, performed without significant morbidity (or mortality) in AF patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications. In most instances, it is performed in patients undergoing mitral valve or Maze surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Maze procedure'</a>.) </p><p>One limitation to surgical LAA ligation is that it may be incomplete, as detected by transesophageal echocardiography. The incidence of incomplete LAA ligation was 22 percent in two series with a total of 108 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Such patients continue to be at risk for LAA thrombus and thromboembolic events. </p><p>There are limited data suggesting that this approach can reduce the risk of stroke. The following two retrospective observational studies provide some evidence: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early study of 205 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement (83 percent for rheumatic heart disease, 86 percent in atrial fibrillation [AF]), ligation of the LAA was performed in 58 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After almost six years, the incidence of an embolic event in those with LAA ligation was significantly lower than in those without this procedure (3 versus 17 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 10,633 adults who underwent cardiac surgery, 461 matching pairs (with and without LAA closure) were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Among the matching pairs, there was a significantly higher rate of postoperative (within 30 days) AF (68.6 versus 31.9 percent; p&lt;001) in those who underwent LAA closure, but no significant difference in the risk of stroke or mortality. In addition, there was no difference between the two matched groups in the long-term risks of stroke or death.</p><p/><p>In a patient with atrial fibrillation who has undergone surgical closure of the LAA, a transesophageal echo should be performed postoperatively to confirm that the LAA has been completely closed or removed before decisions are made regarding the need for long term oral anticoagulation.</p><p>The feasibility of a stand-alone, thoracoscopic approach for left atrial appendectomy was demonstrated in a study of 30 patients with AF and prior thromboembolism who had contraindications to oral anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thoracoscopic appendectomy was not associated with increased mortality or major complications. At a mean follow-up of 16 months, no patients had experienced a recurrence of thromboembolism. </p><p>Another surgical method to exclude the LAA is the AtriClip device. In a study of 71 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using a median sternotomy, exclusion of the LAA was confirmed in over 95 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The importance of the LAA in thromboembolic risk among patients with AF provides the rationale for ligation, amputation, or occlusion of the LAA in patients who are candidates for but have either absolute or relative contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H3502524461\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous approaches, referred to as LAA occlusion procedures, that mechanically prevent embolization of LAA thrombi have been developed and shown to be effective. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous LAA occlusion'</a> above.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonvalvular AF patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation and who have reasons to avoid long-term oral anticoagulation, we suggest an LAA occlusion procedure rather than not taking long-term anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'WATCHMAN device'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Among these devices, we prefer the WATCHMAN. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'WATCHMAN device'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After placement of an LAA occlusion device, patients are treated with oral anticoagulation plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for about six weeks followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> plus aspirin out to six months. Aspirin is continued for life. For patients with absolute contraindications to oral anticoagulants, we give dual antiplatelet therapy for six months. All patients are referred for a post-procedural transesophageal echocardiogram at about six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2986110994\" class=\"local\">'Management after device implantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of the LAA at the time of cardiac, and in particular mitral valve, surgery is performed by many surgeons with expertise in this technique. The evidence supporting this procedure is limited and weak.
