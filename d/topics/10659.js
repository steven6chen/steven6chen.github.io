These changes contribute to optimal growth and development of the fetus and help to protect the mother from the risks of delivery, such as hemorrhage. Knowledge of these cardiovascular adaptations is required to correctly interpret hemodynamic and cardiovascular tests in the gravida, to predict the effects of pregnancy on the woman with underlying cardiac disease, and to understand how the fetus will be affected by maternal cardiac disorders.</p><p>The cardiovascular changes associated with normal pregnancy will be reviewed here.

Cardiac output continues to rise, but in a nonlinear fashion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third trimester (28 weeks of gestation to delivery) &ndash; Cardiac output peaks in the early third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Heart rate, which rises throughout gestation, peaks in the late third trimester at an average of 16 beats per minute (24 percent) above nonpregnant values. Supine positioning reduces cardiac output and stroke volume and increases heart rate due to compression of the aorta and vena cava from the enlarging uterus. Placing the woman in the left lateral decubitus position shifts the uterus off the aorta and vena cava, which in turn increases blood flow to the heart and results in increased cardiac output and stroke volume. Blood pressure returns to prepregnancy levels during the third trimester. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrapartum &ndash; Cardiac output increases by 15 percent above prelabor levels in early labor and 25 percent during the active phase.

With epidural anesthesia, the baseline increase in cardiac output is attenuated; however, the increases associated with uterine contractions persist. Position changes from supine to lateral decubitus during labor increases cardiac output. This effect is more pronounced during labor, suggesting that cardiac output during labor may be more dependent on preload. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum &ndash; Following birth, heart rate and blood pressure returns to non-pregnant values and remains unchanged throughout the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in blood volume</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4128796442\"><span class=\"h3\">Timeline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expansion of the plasma volume and an increase in red blood cell mass begin as early as the fourth week of pregnancy, peak at 28 to 34 weeks of gestation, and then plateau until parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Increased plasma erythropoietin induces the rise in red cell mass, which partially supports the higher metabolic requirement for oxygen during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

This becomes most apparent at 30 to 34 weeks of gestation when plasma volume peaks in relation to red cell volume. Assuming normal renal function, blood volume and constituents return to nonpregnant values by eight weeks postpartum, a result of diuresis. Hemoglobin begins to increase from the third postpartum day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The physiologic effects of hypervolemia and anemia during pregnancy have several benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased blood viscosity (from greater increases in plasma volume than red cell volume) results in reduced resistance to flow, facilitating placental perfusion and lowering cardiac work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total intravascular volume increases to approximately 50 percent above nonpregnant values near term to provide some reserve against the normal blood loss during parturition (about 300 to 500 mL for vaginal delivery, 600 to 1000 mL for cesarean delivery) and peripartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

A population-based, case-control study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register reported that women with a hemoglobin concentration of 14.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or higher at the first prenatal visit were at increased risk of stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), antepartum stillbirth without malformations (OR 2.0), and preterm and small for gestational age nonmalformed stillbirth (OR 2.7 and 4.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The elevated risk persisted despite a subsequent fall in hemoglobin concentration and after excluding women with preeclampsia.

A change in the rate and distribution of cardiac output (the product of stroke volume and heart rate) occurs during pregnancy to meet these demands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55985 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1500778504\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During normal pregnancy, the resting heart rate begins to rise in the first trimester, with an average increase of 10 to 30 beats per minute (71 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 10 bpm) having been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In one meta-analysis, heart rate peaked in the late third trimester at an average of 16 bpm (83 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 10) (24 percent) above nonpregnant values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The maximum heart rate occurs in the third trimester and returns to baseline quickly postpartum. The upper limit of resting heart rate is typically not greater than 95 bpm. Thus, pregnant women with resting heart rates &gt;100 bpm are generally considered to have tachycardia and warrant further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac output</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physiology</strong> &ndash; The cardiac output, calculated as the heart rate x the stroke volume, rises 30 to 50 percent (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span> above baseline during normal pregnancy. The elevation in cardiac performance results in part from changes in three important factors that determine cardiac output:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preload is increased due to the associated rise in blood volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Afterload is reduced due to the decline in systemic vascular resistance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Afterload is reduced due to the decline in systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maternal heart rate rises (see <a href=\"#H1500778504\" class=\"local\">'Heart rate'</a> above) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In early pregnancy, increased cardiac output is primarily related to the rise in stroke volume; one meta-analysis reported an 8 percent increase (6 mL) in stroke volume in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In late pregnancy, heart rate change is the major factor contributing to increased cardiac output. The ejection fraction is unchanged from normal nonpregnant values, making it a reliable indicator of left ventricular function during pregnancy, although the direct effect of pregnancy on left ventricular contractility remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although changes in blood volume during pregnancy affect right ventricular preload, central venous pressure remains in the normal nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy due to the reduction in cardiac afterload induced by the substantial decrease in both systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance (ie, afterload to the left and right heart, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regardless of the mechanism, the stress induced by the increase in cardiac output can cause women with underlying and, in some cases, asymptomatic heart disease to decompensate during the latter half of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heart failure during pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac function</strong> &ndash; The inherent contractility of the myocardium is stable to slightly improved in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This stable to improved function may be a result of increased left ventricular mass, with the greatest change, an increase of an average of 40 g (34 percent) above baseline, noted in the early third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures remain in the normal nonpregnant range since the hypervolemia of pregnancy is balanced by the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing</strong> &ndash; About one-half of the increase in cardiac output occurs by eight weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/20,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27-30</a>]. The slope of increase in cardiac output slows in the late second trimester and drops in the late third trimester, although it remains above prepregnancy levels until postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Increased venacaval compression by the uterus, increased blood flow to the uteroplacental circulation, or both have been a proposed as the cause of the late third trimester drop. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact of maternal posture</strong> &ndash; The degree of change is acutely influenced by posture, as the cardiac output is higher when the pregnant woman is in the left lateral decubitus position, particularly after 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/6,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31,32</a>]. By comparison, assumption of the supine position can lower the cardiac output by as much as 25 to 30 percent due to compression of the inferior cava by the gravid uterus, leading to a substantial reduction in venous return to the heart. Changes in maternal heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output during pregnancy measured in the lateral and supine positions are demonstrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55985 \">figure 5</a>).

In the third trimester, blood pressure gradually increases and may normalize to nonpregnant values by term.</p><p>The fall in BP is induced by a reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which in pregnancy appears to parallel changes in afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A meta-analysis of 39 studies reported that the SVR progressively dropped throughout pregnancy, with the lowest value (396 dyne <span class=\"nowrap\">s/cm<sup>6</sup>)</span> being 30 percent below the nonpregnant baseline and occurring in the early third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Both creation of a high flow, low-resistance circuit in the uteroplacental circulation and vasodilatation contribute to the decline in vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

This occurs in normal, healthy pregnant patients primarily in the supine position or with prolonged standing. It is generally relieved by displacing the uterus to the left and off the IVC by having the patient positioned in the left lateral decubitus position or manually displacing the uterus to the left side. Other, less common, causes of supine hypotension include aortic compression and neurogenic etiologies.</p><p>The reduction in preload can result in maternal hypotension, usually within 3 to 10 minutes, associated with one or more signs and symptoms of reflex autonomic activation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced cardiac output (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80135 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

As a result, the apical impulse is shifted cephalad to the fourth intercostal space and laterally to the midclavicular line. The left ventricular impulse is relatively hyperdynamic but not sustained; the right ventricle may be palpable because, like the left ventricle, it handles a larger volume of blood that is ejected against relatively low resistance.
