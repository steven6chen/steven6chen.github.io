Determination of whether an indication for early surgical intervention in IE is present is a critical aspect in the management of IE patients. In general, surgery is warranted in the setting of complications for which antibiotic treatment alone is unlikely to cure the condition or prevent further complications or death. For patients with IE with an indication for surgical intervention, an individualized risk-benefit analysis is performed by a multispecialty heart valve team to determine whether, when and what surgical procedure should be performed to improve patient outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3731014524\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL REFERRAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235591099\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for surgical consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prompt surgical consultation is warranted in all patients with infective endocarditis (IE), as indications for surgical intervention may appear or progress rapidly. Patients with IE are best managed by a multispecialty heart valve team that includes an infectious disease specialist, cardiologist, and cardiac surgeon, with input from neurology, neurosurgery, radiology, and other specialists based on the individual case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Multidisciplinary treatment of IE has been found to reduce mortality in IE by improving the use of surgery based on indications and consideration of operative risk and optimal timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of whether a patient with IE requires early surgical treatment depends upon many clinical and prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Early surgery in IE has been broadly defined as surgery performed before completion of a full course of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following recommendations are similar to those in guidelines established by United States and European cardiology societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,10</a>]. </p><p>Referral for early surgery is indicated in patients with left-sided native valve IE in the following clinical settings. The evidence supporting these recommendations is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1463075723\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for surgical indications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with IE-associated valve dysfunction (usually aortic or mitral regurgitation) causing symptoms or signs of heart failure, we recommend referral for early valve surgery.

Difficult-to-treat pathogens include fungi and multidrug-resistant organisms. We do not consider <em>S. aureus</em> IE alone an indication for early surgery.

We favor referral for surgery to reduce the risk of embolism in the following clinical settings (see <a href=\"#H1629662894\" class=\"local\">'Vegetation characteristics and risk of embolization'</a> below): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with recurrent systemic emboli and persistent or enlarging vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, we suggest referral for early surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with mobile vegetations &gt;10 mm on the mitral or aortic valve and with one or more other relative indications for surgery (eg, severe valve regurgitation or single previous embolic event), if surgery is performed within the first week of antibiotic treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1463075723\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence for surgical indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for surgical management of IE are based largely on observational studies since only one small randomized trial has been performed of surgery for IE as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1629662894\" class=\"local\">'Vegetation characteristics and risk of embolization'</a> below.) Since observational studies are subject to bias (including survivor and selection bias) and confounding, studies have used various methods in an attempt to more accurately assess the effect of surgery on outcomes. Observational studies that have adjusted for bias and confounding have produced mixed results. Among studies of patients with IE that have adjusted for survivor bias, some have found harm or no significant benefit associated with surgery compared with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], while others have found an association between valve surgery and reduced mortality (in-hospital, at one year, or at five years), particularly for patients with IE complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The differing results may be due to difference in analytic methods, as well as differences in patient populations, particularly since studies were not limited to patients with commonly accepted indications for surgery. </p><p>Surgery is recommended only for selected patients with IE, and in the absence of large randomized trials, the most relevant evidence on efficacy comes from studies that included propensity scoring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subset analysis of patients with high-risk features considered indications for surgery. Evidence of an association between surgery and reduced mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] has been found in patients with complicated IE, including heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>], intracardiac abscess or fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], native valve <em>S. aureus</em> IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], or systemic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Further studies are needed to identify patients with IE that will benefit from valve surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31088606\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The survival benefit of surgery in IE appears to be greatest among patients with severe valve dysfunction causing heart failure. Ideally, surgery should be undertaken as soon as signs and symptoms of heart failure appear and before hemodynamic instability occurs. </p><p>Prior to valve replacement or repair for management of endocarditis, approximately 90 percent of deaths among patients with IE were attributable to heart failure. Moderate to severe heart failure due to IE confers a high risk for mortality in the absence of surgery. In such cases, medical therapy alone is associated with approximately 75 percent mortality; with surgery, the mortality rate is &le;25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Among patients with IE who undergo surgery, heart failure is the indication in 65 to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Surgery should be undertaken as soon as signs and symptoms of heart failure appear, before extreme or refractory hemodynamic deterioration occurs. This recommendation is supported by a prospective multicenter study of 4075 patients with IE, including 1359 with heart failure; surgery was performed in 62 percent of patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Surgery was associated with lower in-hospital mortality versus no surgery in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I or II heart failure and a greater reduction in mortality rate with surgery was seen in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. Both in-hospital and one-year mortality rates were significantly lower among patients with heart failure who underwent surgery during the initial hospitalization than patients who did not (21 versus 45 percent and 29 versus 58 percent, respectively).</p><p>Nearly all patients with severe valvular regurgitation due to endocarditis will have signs and symptoms of heart failure due to acute volume overload of the nondilated left ventricle. IE in patients with preexisting compensated valvular regurgitation may lead to decompensation due to worsening valve damage and further regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although heart failure due to IE with valve destruction and severe regurgitation may be stabilized with medical therapy, heart failure is an indication for early surgical intervention. Even in the absence of overt heart failure, individuals with severe regurgitation (based on quantitative echo parameters) and hemodynamic compromise (such as tachycardia or evidence of elevated pressure within the pulmonary circulation) may be candidates for early surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53536%7ECARD%2F95916%7ECARD%2F95917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53536 graphicRef95916 graphicRef95917 \">table 1A-C</a>). In the rare patient with IE and severe regurgitation in whom there are no clinical or echocardiographic signs of cardiac decompensation, initial non-surgical management may be reasonable with the timing of intervention than based on standard indications for chronic native valve regurgitation. The role of surgery in patients with severe valve stenosis or regurgitation and a large mobile vegetation is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1629662894\" class=\"local\">'Vegetation characteristics and risk of embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Noncardiac factors may exaggerate manifestations of heart failure; these include fever, anemia, sepsis, and renal insufficiency. In addition, patients with antecedent left ventricular dysfunction may present with signs or symptoms of heart failure that are out of proportion to the degree of valvular dysfunction caused by IE. Such patients require careful evaluation and management with diuretics and vasodilators, as well as close surveillance of the response to therapy. In some cases of acute heart failure in IE, heart failure symptoms may improve or resolve with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Endocarditis caused by a difficult-to-treat pathogen may also be considered complicated. </p><p>Complicated infection should be suspected in patients with persistent fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistently positive blood cultures after five to seven days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. In such cases, meticulous clinical evaluation for metastatic infection, drug fever, and secondary (often nosocomial) infection is needed. Patients should also undergo transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate for the presence of paravalvular infection. Issues related to complicated IE are discussed further separately.

A rationale for proceeding with early surgery in patients with persistent infection is that paravalvular abscess may be missed by transesophageal echocardiography, particularly when the abscess is located adjacent to mitral annular calcification.

The risk of embolization in the setting of native valve endocarditis is 13 to 44 percent and in many cases embolization occurs before a diagnosis of IE has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].

The risk of embolization tends to decline rapidly after initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy, and serious embolic events are uncommon a week after such therapy is begun. In a multicenter study of 384 patients with definite IE (75 percent with native valve endocarditis), S. aureus and S. bovis were predictors of total embolic events, while vegetation length &gt;10 mm and severe vegetation mobility were significant predictors of embolic events after initiation of antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Major factors predictive of operative mortality included surgical urgency (especially emergent status), hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock, renal failure, and surgery before completion of antibiotic therapy. In addition to predicting operative mortality, this STS-IE risk score has been found to predict six-month mortality in IE, likely because it captures many adverse conditions, such as renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In general, early surgery is warranted for patients with the indications discussed above, irrespective of the duration of preoperative antibiotic therapy. However, the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is typically four to six weeks, a wide time interval to select an appropriate time for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3981624937\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for timing of surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Timing of surgery is based upon balancing the urgency of indications for surgery against risk factors or contraindications for surgery.

As an example, in patients with severe heart failure due to endocarditis-associated valve dysfunction, emergent or urgent surgery is indicated unless surgery is deemed contraindicated (eg, large ischemic stroke with coma or large intracranial hemorrhage that precludes heparinization) or futile (eg, multiple or severe stroke in patient with comorbidities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>For patients with native valve endocarditis with indications for early surgery, we generally favor proceeding with surgery within a few days of development of the surgical indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Similarly, a study including 214 patients who underwent cardiac surgery (including 65 of patients with embolic stroke) demonstrated no difference in perioperative mortality between patients with or without embolic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In a study including 198 patients with IE and ischemic stroke who underwent surgery (30 percent underwent surgery &le;7 days after stroke and 70 percent underwent surgery &gt;7 days after stroke), there was no apparent survival benefit in delaying surgery when indicated; one-year mortality was comparable between the groups (27 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>For patients with ischemic stroke with severe neurologic deficits or diminished consciousness and for patients with hemorrhagic stroke, the risk of postoperative neurological deterioration and mortality is greater, so an individualized approach to timing of surgery is indicated. The timing of cardiac surgery for IE with these neurologic complications is challenging and debatable. As noted above, we favor delaying surgery by four weeks or more in patients with IE with ischemic stroke with severe neurologic deficit or altered consciousness; and we favor delaying valve surgery for &ge;4 weeks after intracranial hemorrhage. A rationale for delaying surgery for at least four weeks after major ischemic stroke is to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in this high-risk population. Thus, the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) IE guidelines contain recommendations similar to the 2017 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/American</span> College of Cardiology focused update on valvular heart disease, which notes that it is reasonable to delay valve surgery for at least four weeks after major ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage if the patient is hemodynamically stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,65</a>].

We do not consider <em>S. aureus</em> IE an indication for early surgery. &#160;(See <a href=\"#H1889149982\" class=\"local\">'Difficult-to-treat pathogens'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent infection &ndash; We suggest referral for early valve surgery for patients with persistent infection (defined as persistent bacteremia or fever lasting &gt;7 days after initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, provided other sites of infection and causes of fever have been excluded) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2609377569\" class=\"local\">'Persistent infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients at high risk of embolization &ndash; The role of early surgery to prevent embolism is controversial. We suggest referral for early surgery for patients with left-sided native valve IE to reduce the risk of embolism in the following clinical settings (see <a href=\"#H1629662894\" class=\"local\">'Vegetation characteristics and risk of embolization'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with recurrent emboli and persistent or enlarging vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with mobile vegetations &gt;10 mm and with one or more other relative indications for surgery (eg, severe valve regurgitation or single previous embolic event), if surgery is performed within the first week of antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with IE with indications for valve surgery, preoperative assessment includes clinically guided imaging to assess for IE complications or other comorbid conditions and an individualized assessment of surgical risks and benefits. Validated operative risk scores are used to estimate risk of surgical mortality in IE. (See <a href=\"#H236213938\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing for surgery in native valve endocarditis is uncertain. Timing of early surgery in patients with indications is based upon balancing the urgency of indications for surgery against risk factors or contraindications for surgery, generally irrespective of the duration of preoperative antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10834481\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart failure &ndash; The benefits of surgery appear to be greatest among patients with severe valve dysfunction causing heart failure. Ideally, surgery should be undertaken as soon as signs and symptoms of heart failure appear and before hemodynamic instability occurs. (See <a href=\"#H31088606\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Timing following stroke &ndash; No delay in valve surgery is required for silent microembolism, transient ischemic attack, cerebral abscess, or ischemic stroke with no hemorrhagic conversion and without severe neurological impairment or decreased level of consciousness. For patients with major ischemic stroke (ie, with severe neurologic deficit or altered consciousness) or intracranial hemorrhage, we typically delay surgery for &ge;4 weeks. (See <a href=\"#H3070370377\" class=\"local\">'Timing following stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low life <span class=\"nowrap\">expectancy/high-risk</span> patients &ndash; For patients with low life expectancy, multi-organ failure, or ruptured infectious aneurysm, it is appropriate to delay or defer surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of active infection, valve repair is preferable to valve replacement when feasible; valve replacement is associated with a small risk of infection of prosthetic materials. Valve repair may be possible when a leaflet perforation occurs in the absence of extensive leaflet destruction or annular involvement. (See <a href=\"#H3671814340\" class=\"local\">'Approach to choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of initially positive blood cultures or positive operative cultures, the first day of negative blood cultures or the day of surgery (whichever is later) is counted as the first day of antibiotic therapy for determining the duration of treatment. In the setting of negative blood cultures and negative operative cultures, the duration of antibiotic therapy should be counted from the first day of administration. Antimicrobial therapy should be continued for at least two weeks postoperatively, even if that extends the originally planned antibiotic course. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3788974\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Drs.
