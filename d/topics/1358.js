These viruses, which belong to the families <em>Flaviviridae</em>, <em>Togaviridae</em>, <em>Bunyaviridae</em>, and Reoviridae, are usually highly adapted to particular reservoir hosts and are spread from animal to animal via the bite of an infected arthropod, usually a specific mosquito or tick species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77283 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the major characteristics of most of the arthropod-borne viral encephalitides. General issues related to viral encephalitis, including clinical manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid findings, distinction from postinfectious encephalitis and meningitis, and an approach to the patients with suspected central nervous system infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mosquito or tick becomes infected when feeding on the blood of the viremic animal. The virus then replicates in the mosquito or tick tissues, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The mosquito or tick transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infective salivary fluid while taking a blood meal.</p><p>The natural animal hosts of these viruses usually remain unaffected and viral circulation generally remains undetected until one of the following occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humans encroach on the natural enzootic focus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental or other conditions that favor substantial amplification in the primary vector-host cycle cause a sufficient number of vectors to become infected so that the human risk is substantially increased</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The virus escapes the primary cycle via a secondary vector or vertebrate host, thereby bringing infected, human-biting vectors in close proximity to human habitation</p><p/><p>Although infected humans may become ill, they usually do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors. As a result, humans do not usually contribute to the transmission cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, the greatest public health threat in North America are posed by the West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis viruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77283 \">table 1</a>). Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is of concern in Central and South America, while Japanese encephalitis virus affects persons living or traveling to parts of Asia. Dengue is a rare cause of encephalitis throughout the tropical world. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among the tick-borne viruses that cause encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis virus has the greatest public health impact worldwide and is of concern to residents of or visitors to northern parts of Eastern Europe and Asia. Powassan virus is a rare, tick-borne cause of encephalitis in the north central and northeastern parts of the United States, eastern Canada, and Russia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CROSS-REACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The close antigenic relationships among the flaviviruses may cause a problem with diagnosis. Individuals who have been recently vaccinated with a heterologous flavivirus (eg, yellow fever, tick borne encephalitis virus, or Japanese encephalitis vaccines) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], or who have been recently infected with a related flavivirus, may have a positive serologic test to one or more flaviviruses not causing the current illness. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which is the most specific test for the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, may identify serologic cross-reactions among the flaviviruses. However, some degree of cross-reaction in neutralizing antibody may still cause ambiguous results, particularly in persons with previous exposure to a heterologous flavivirus. Cross reactivities of the bunyaviruses and togaviruses causing encephalitis is not as extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77283 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WEST NILE, ST. LOUIS, AND DENGUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These three causes of arthropod-borne encephalitis are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>West Nile virus encephalitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>St. Louis encephalitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dengue virus infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus (family <em>Togaviridae</em>, genus <em>Alphavirus</em>) is widely distributed throughout North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean. Four genetic lineages exist: Subtype I in North America and the Caribbean, and subtypes II to IV in South and Central America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While subtype I is associated with severe clinical disease, subtypes II to IV are not clearly associated with human disease.</p><p>In North America, wild birds and <em>Culiseta melanura</em>, a mosquito that is found in swamp areas that support cedar, red maple and loblolly bay trees, maintain the virus. However, since <em>Culiseta melanura</em> mosquitoes rarely bite humans, some <em>Aedes</em>, <em>Coquillettidia</em>, and <em>Culex</em> species that are capable of creating a bridge between infected birds and humans are responsible for transmission to humans. The ecology of South American EEE strains is not well described. Laboratory-acquired infections have occurred, and EEE virus is a potential agent of bioterrorism through the aerosol route.</p><p>Although infections can occur throughout the year, peak incidence is in August and September. In the United States, human infections are usually sporadic and small outbreaks occur each summer, mostly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. From 2004 to 2013, 82 cases of EEE were reported, with the largest number of cases identified in Massachusetts, Florida, and New Hampshire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2005, 21 cases were reported, which included an outbreak of 11 cases (with four fatalities) in New Hampshire and Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This was the first outbreak in New Hampshire recorded during 41 years of surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. All 11 patients had resided in a wooded area located within a half mile of a swamp or cranberry bog.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period is usually 4 to 10 days after the mosquito bite. The illness often begins with a prodrome lasting several days, with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting being common. Approximately 2 percent of infected adults and six percent of infected children develop encephalitis. Once neurologic symptoms begin, the clinical condition deteriorates rapidly, with approximately 90 percent becoming comatose or stuporous. Seizures, and focal neurologic signs, including cranial nerve palsies, develop in approximately one-half of the patients. </p><p>Leukocytosis and hyponatremia are common on laboratory testing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows pleocytosis, often with a neutrophilic predominance and elevated protein concentration. In one case series of 36 patients with EEE, an elevated white cell count in the initial CSF examination and the severity of hyponatremia correlated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, these findings were not observed in a series that evaluated a younger population with EEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Electroencephalography reveals generalized slowing and disorganization of the background, and epileptiform discharges may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT). Both are often abnormal early in the course, with focal lesions in the basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem being particularly common. Cortical lesions, meningeal enhancement, and periventricular white-matter changes are less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of EEE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against EEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EEE virus is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides, with a mortality of at least 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Death can occur within three to five days of onset and, among survivors, complete recovery is uncommon. Sequelae include convulsions, paralysis, and mental retardation. EEE in South America is less severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific treatment for EEE is available. In one series, patients treated with anticonvulsants or corticosteroids had worse outcomes than those not treated, a finding possibly resulting from patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Three case reports have suggested a possible benefit of IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Prevention focuses primarily upon avoiding mosquito bites, which includes mosquito control in suburban areas. Although inactivated vaccines are available for horses, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. However, an inactivated vaccine has been used in laboratory workers and others at high risk of exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WESTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus (family <em>Togaviridae</em>, genus <em>Alphavirus</em>) is a complex of closely related viruses found in North and South America. Flooding, which increases breeding of Culex mosquitoes, may precipitate summer outbreaks. Large outbreaks in humans and horses occurred in the western United States in the 1950s and 1960s. However, a declining horse population, equine vaccination, and improved vector control have reduced the incidence of the disease. WEE is a potential agent of bioterrorism through the aerosol route.</p><p>Fewer than 1 in 1000 infected adults develop encephalitis, but the frequency is greater in children, particularly infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Following an incubation period of about seven days, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and backache are typical; restlessness, irritability, and seizures are common in children. Although rare in adults and older children, neurologic sequelae are relatively common in infants. The case fatality rate is 3 to 7 percent.</p><p>The diagnosis of WEE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against WEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Prevention focuses on mosquito control and personal measures to avoid mosquito bites. Inactivated vaccine is available for horses. Although inactivated vaccine has been used for laboratory staff and others at high risk of exposure, it is not commercially available for use in humans. No specific treatment is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Japanese encephalitis is an arboviral encephalitis that is endemic throughout much of tropical East Asia. Issues related to Japanese encephalitis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=japanese-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Japanese encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">LA CROSSE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>La Crosse virus (LAC, family <em>Bunyaviridae</em>, genus <em>Bunyavirus</em>) is the most pathogenic member of the California encephalitis serogroup, which includes the California encephalitis, trivittatus, snowshoe hare, and Jamestown Canyon viruses. LAC is transmitted via <em>Aedes triseriatus</em> (eastern tree hole mosquito), and mammalian hosts include the eastern chipmunk, tree squirrels, and foxes. </p><p>Human infections occur in the central and eastern United States, mostly in school-aged children from July through September [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Most infections are asymptomatic. Approximately 80 to 100 La Crosse encephalitis neuroinvasive disease cases are reported annually.</p><p>The characteristics of symptomatic disease, which begins after an incubation period of three to seven days, were evaluated in a review of 127 patients who required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the patients were school-aged children (range 0.5 to 15 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache, fever, and vomiting were each present in at least 70 percent of patients and disorientation in 42 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures occurred in 46 percent, 62 percent of which had have a focal component and 24 percent of which progressed to status epilepticus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 percent had focal neurologic abnormalities. The findings of fever, focal neurologic signs, and focal seizures mimic herpes simplex encephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aseptic meningitis alone, without evidence of encephalitis, occurred in 13 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia was present in 21 percent and was present in all 13 patients (11 percent) whose condition deteriorated in the hospital.</p><p/><p>All of patients survived, which is consistent with a very low mortality rate in other reports. However, 12 percent of children had residual neurologic sequelae, including focal neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral deficits.</p><p>Leukocytosis is common, with polymorphonuclear cells predominating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. CSF shows pleocytosis with either neutrophilic or lymphocytic predominance. Electroencephalography is abnormal in two-thirds of patients, mainly with slowing or epileptiform discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Focal features or periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges, usually with involvement of the temporal lobe, may suggest herpes simplex encephalitis.</p><p>CT scan is generally normal, but may show generalized cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. MRI may show focal areas of gadolinium enhancement.</p><p>The diagnosis of LAC can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against LAC virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Viral isolation from the CSF is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Treatment is supportive, with emphasis on control of cerebral edema and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ribavirin</a> has been used, but efficacy is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Prevention rests on avoidance of mosquito bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A case of possible congenital infection has also been reported with IgM antibodies identified in the umbilical cord blood; however, the newborn was asymptomatic and development was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No seroconversion was documented in this case because the mother declined further testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MURRAY VALLEY ENCEPHALITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus (family <em>Flaviviridae</em>, genus <em>Flavivirus</em>), occurs in Australia, New Guinea, and probably islands in the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. MVE virus is believed to be maintained in a natural cycle involving water birds and <em>Culex annulirostris</em> mosquitoes. Viremia has not been documented in humans, who are likely dead-end hosts.</p><p>Only one in 1000 to 2000 infections results in clinical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], which resembles Japanese encephalitis. There is usually a prodromal illness with headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, and myalgias, followed by drowsiness, malaise, irritability, mental confusion, and meningismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Seizures are more common in children. In severe cases, there may be hyperactive reflexes, spastic paresis, seizures, coma, and death.</p><p>CT scan is normal in about two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Reported abnormalities include mild hydrocephalus, cerebral edema, reduced attenuation extending from the thalami to the brainstem, and cerebral atrophy.</p><p>The diagnosis of MVE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against MVE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients with MVE die and about half the survivors have residual neurologic deficits. Children and the elderly are at highest risk.</p><p>There is no vaccine for MVE virus. Prevention relies on mosquito control and avoidance of mosquito bites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Six subtypes (I-VI) within the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus (family <em>Togaviridae</em>, genus <em>Alphavirus</em>) complex have been identified. Four antigenic variants exist within subtype I (IAB, IC, ID, IE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These subtypes and variants are classified as epizootic (can produce outbreaks of illness in animals) or enzootic (infects animals in a region, but often produces asymptomatic or sporadic illness in animals), based upon their apparent virulence and epidemiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epizootic variants of subtype I (IAB and IC) cause equine epizootics and are associated with more severe human disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzootic strains (ID, 1E, 1F [Masso das Piedras], II [Everglades], III [Mucambo, Tonate], IV [Pixuna], V [Cabassou], VI [Rio Negro]) do not cause epizootics in horses, but may produce sporadic disease in humans.</p><p/><p>Epizootic strains are transmitted by many mosquitoes, and enzootic strains by <em>Culex</em> mosquitoes.</p><p>VEE has a widespread geographic distribution from Florida to South America, where it is an important veterinary and public health problem. Focal outbreaks occur periodically, but occasionally, large regional epidemics occur, with thousands of equine and human infections. VEE is infectious via aerosols, making it an occupational risk to certain laboratory workers and a potential agent of bioterrorism.</p><p>After an incubation period of one to six days, there is a brief febrile illness of sudden onset, characterized by malaise, nausea or vomiting, headache, and myalgia. Less than 0.5 percent of adults and less than 4 percent of children develop encephalitis, characterized by nuchal rigidity, seizures, coma, and paralysis. Long-term sequelae and fatalities are uncommon.</p><p>The diagnosis of VEE can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against VEE virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Viremia is usually not detectable in serum. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Effective prevention of both human and equine disease can be accomplished by immunizing equines, which serve as the primary amplification hosts for the epizootic VEE viruses and without which there would be little human disease. During epidemics, mosquito vectors can be controlled by insecticides. Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been used for laboratory workers; however, human vaccines are not commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by three closely related viruses (family <em>Flaviviridae</em>, genus <em>Flavivirus</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Russian spring-summer encephalitis subtype (also called far eastern subtype)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Siberian subtype also called Vasilchenko virus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Central European encephalitis subtype (also called western subtype)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Vector</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These viruses are maintained in natural cycles involving a variety of mammals and ticks. <em>Ixodes persulcatus</em> and <em>Ixodes ricinus</em> are responsible for transmission in Russia and Europe, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. <em>Ixodes ovatus</em> is the vector in Hokkaido.

It is maintained in a cycle between ticks and rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Two lineages of Powassan virus exist in North America. Lineage 1 Powassan virus is associated with <em>Ixodes cookei</em> ticks and <span class=\"nowrap\">groundhogs/mustelids,</span> and <em>Ixodes marxi</em> ticks and squirrels. These ticks rarely bite humans. Lineage 2 Powassan virus, sometimes called deer tick virus, is associated with <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> ticks and a variety of hosts, including white-footed mice. <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> also transmits Lyme disease, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis. </p><p>Since its discovery in 1958, Powassan virus has become recognized as an uncommon cause of encephalitis in Russia, eastern Canada, and the north central, northeastern, and upper midwestern United States. However, the incidence of Powassan virus infection appears to be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>], and from 2006 through 2015, 68 cases were reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mostly from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Infection mostly occurs from June to September.</p><p>The reported incubation periods range from 8 to 34 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. However, few patients recall a tick bite, since Ixodid ticks are small and can be easily overlooked. Symptomatic patients typically present with fever, weakness, paralysis, somnolence, gastrointestinal complaints, headache, and confusion, and seizures can occur.</p><p>Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples can be tested for IgM and neutralizing antibodies. The diagnosis of Powassan virus infection can be made by demonstration of IgM antibody by capture immunoassay of CSF, a fourfold rise in serum antibody titers against the virus, or isolation of virus from or demonstration of viral antigen or genomic sequences in tissue, blood, or CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum IgM antibodies alone should be confirmed by demonstration of neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>The case-fatality rate is approximately 10 percent, with a high incidence of residual neurological dysfunction among survivors, including hemiplegia, headaches, minor memory impairment, and persistent ophthalmoplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/34,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37,38</a>].</p><p>There is no specific treatment or vaccine. Prevention of tick bites by using repellents, avoiding or clearing brushy areas, wearing light colored clothing may be effective. Removing ticks soon after outdoor exposure is advisable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">COLORADO TICK FEVER VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Colorado tick fever virus (genus Coltivirus, family Reoviridae) is transmitted to humans in the western United States and Canada mainly by the Rocky Mountain wood tick, <em>Dermacentor andersoni</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68829\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68829 \">picture 1</a>). Small rodents are the natural hosts of the virus. The distribution of human disease corresponds to the wood tick's distribution in mountainous areas at 4000- to 10,000-foot elevations. Transmission occurs from March to September, but peaks from April to June [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Transmission via blood transfusion has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The mean incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, and 90 percent of patients report tick bites or tick exposure. Fever, chills, myalgias, and prostration are common presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Headache often occurs during the acute febrile phase. Approximately 15 percent of patients experience a petechial or maculopapular rash and leukopenia is a common finding. Although the acute symptoms last about one week, fever may recur several days later, and fatigue is often prolonged. Five to 10 percent of children develop meningitis or encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Serologic tests are often not positive for 10 to 14 days after symptom onset. In comparison, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be diagnostic from the first day of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The virus infects marrow erythrocytic precursors, which accounts for the ability to recover the virus from peripheral blood up to six weeks after illness onset.</p><p>Treatment is supportive and the prognosis is generally favorable. Prevention consists of avoidance of tick bites in endemic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANDIPURA VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the 1950's, outbreaks of encephalitis of unknown etiology and high mortality have occurred in children in India. In 2003 in Southern India, an outbreak of acute encephalitis in 329 children was associated with Chandipura virus (genus <em>Vesiculovirus</em>, family <em>Rhabdoviridae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The affected children all tested negative for eight other potential viral causes including Japanese encephalitis (which is responsible for many encephalitis outbreaks in India), West Nile virus, dengue, and measles virus. The Chandipura virus was identified by electron microscopy, complement fixation, and neutralization tests. The observation that IgM titers directed against this virus were more frequently identified after four days of illness compared to baseline values provided further evidence supporting its pathogenetic role. Nevertheless, speculation remains whether the cause of illness is due to encephalitis or other pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Chandipura virus encephalitis may be transmitted by sandfly bites and has been identified in <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes. Illness is characterized by the rapid onset of fever followed by vomiting, altered mental status, and seizures. The mortality rate in the 2003 outbreak was 56 percent. A similar outbreak occurred in 26 children in western India in 2004, with a mortality of 78 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], while an outbreak in 39 children in Maharashtra in 2007 had a mortality of 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11535065\"><span class=\"h1\">TOSCANA VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toscana virus (genus <em>Phlebovirus</em>, family <em>Bunyaviridae</em>) is transmitted to humans in southern Europe by infected <em>Phlebotomus</em> sandflies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. High seroprevalence rates in populations in endemic areas suggest that most infections are asymptomatic or clinically inconsequential. The incubation period is from a few days to two weeks. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms; decreased consciousness, paresis, and ocular findings may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthropod-borne-encephalitides/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Prognosis is generally favorable. CSF examination generally shows pleocytosis.

These viruses are spread from animal to animal via the bite of an infected arthropod, usually a specific mosquito or tick species. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mosquito or tick becomes infected when feeding on the blood of the viremic animal. The virus then replicates in the mosquito or tick, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The vector then transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infective salivary fluid while taking a blood meal. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transmission cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although infected humans may become ill, they usually do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors. As a result, humans do not usually contribute to the transmission cycle. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transmission cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, the greatest public health threat in North America is posed by the West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis viruses. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus is of concern in Central and South America, while Japanese encephalitis virus affects persons living or traveling to parts of Asia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Geographic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the tick-borne viruses that cause encephalitis, tick-borne Encephalitis virus causes the greatest public health threat among residents or visitors to Eastern Europe and Asia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Geographic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The close antigenic relationships among the flaviviruses may cause a problem with diagnosis due to cross-reactivity. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cross-reactivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) is widely distributed throughout North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean. EEE virus is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides, with a mortality of at least 30 percent. There is no specific therapy for EEE (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Eastern equine encephalitis virus'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus is a found in North and South America and is a potential agent of bioterrorism through the aerosol route. The case fatality rate is 3 to 7 percent. Although inactivated vaccine has been used for laboratory staff and others at high risk of exposure, it is not commercially available for use in humans. No specific treatment is available. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Western equine encephalitis virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>La Crosse virus (LAC, family Bunyaviridae, genus Bunyavirus) is the most pathogenic member of the California encephalitis serogroup. Human infections occur in the central and eastern United States, mostly in school-aged children from July through September. Most infections are asymptomatic; of those who present with encephalitis, the mortality rates are low. Treatment is supportive, with emphasis on control of cerebral edema and seizures. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ribavirin</a> has been used, but efficacy is unproven. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'La Crosse encephalitis virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus), occurs in Australia, New Guinea, and probably islands in the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago. MVE virus is believed to be maintained in a natural cycle involving water birds and Culex annulirostris mosquitoes. Viremia has not been documented in humans, who are likely dead-end hosts. Only 1 in 1000 to 2000 infections results in clinical illness; however, approximately one-third of patients with MVE die and about half the survivors have residual neurologic deficits. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Murray valley encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) has a widespread geographic distribution from Florida to South America, where it is an important veterinary and public health problem. Focal outbreaks occur periodically, but occasionally, large regional epidemics occur, with thousands of equine and human infections. VEE is infectious via aerosols, making it an occupational risk to certain laboratory workers and a potential agent of bioterrorism. Effective prevention of both human and equine disease can be accomplished by immunizing equines, which serve as the primary amplification hosts for the epizootic VEE viruses. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) exists over a wide geographical area, including Russia and Europe. Human exposure occurs through work or recreational activities when the ticks are most active. TBE virus is transmitted from the saliva of an infected tick within minutes of the bite; early removal of the tick may not prevent encephalitis. Case fatality rates range from two to eight percent. Treatment is mainly supportive. Powassan virus is related to the eastern hemisphere's tick-borne encephalitis viruses.
