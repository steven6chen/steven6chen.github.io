Each year, approximately one million patients receive LTOT through Medicare, at a cost exceeding two billion dollars per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This cost is increasing at an annual rate of nearly 13 percent.</p><p>Because LTOT is a costly therapy, Medicare reimbursement for its prescription is tightly regulated. In this topic review, we describe the benefits of LTOT and indications for its use. In addition, we address practical issues including reimbursement, documenting the patient's need for LTOT, and the process of prescribing LTOT that is necessary for the patients to receive their oxygen. High-flow nasal cannula, portable oxygen delivery, and oxygen conserving devices are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portable-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-conserving-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portable oxygen delivery and oxygen conserving devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five randomized trials have evaluated the effect of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) on mortality in patients with COPD. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the trials, the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, demonstrated improved survival among patients that received LTOT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82598 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67353 \">figure 2</a>), including correlation between survival and the average daily duration of oxygen use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, two trials (nocturnal oxygen therapy [NOT] and supplemental oxygen for moderate hypoxemia), found no effect of LTOT on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Long-Term Oxygen Therapy Trial (LOTT), stable COPD patients with moderate resting hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> 89 to 93 percent) were randomly assigned to long-term oxygen or no supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because recruitment goals were lacking at seven months into the study, the study was redesigned to include patients with moderate exercise-induced desaturation between 80 and 90 percent, as well as, resting desaturation. There was no between group difference in survival, time to first hospitalization, or other measured outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>An important difference between these trials was the inclusion criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The trials that demonstrated a survival benefit included patients with more severe resting hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>] &le;60 mmHg [7.98 kPa]) than the trials that showed no benefit (PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;69 mmHg [9.18 kPa]), indicating that individuals with less severe hypoxemia may not derive survival benefit from LTOT.</p><p>LTOT may improve outcome measures other than mortality, including quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, depression, cognitive function, exercise capacity, and frequency of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/3,5-12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-12,17,18</a>]. Improved quality of life was demonstrated in a prospective study that measured health related quality of life (using the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) before and after six months of LTOT delivered via a concentrator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Prior to therapy, health related quality of life was worse among the patients with COPD who had hypoxemia (and had already been receiving LTOT for at least six months via a cylinder), compared to patients with COPD who were not hypoxemic. After six months of LTOT, health-related quality of life had improved and was similar in both groups. This suggests that LTOT improves quality of life and the improvement is related, at least in part, to the time spent using supplemental oxygen, which also relates to the delivery system(s) used. The effect of combining concentrators and portable devices to improve mobility and further enhance quality of life has yet to be determined. Prescribing oxygen during exertion with highly portable lightweight devices without the support of a pulmonary rehabilitation program may or may not lead to a more active lifestyle.</p><p>All of the studies described above evaluated the impact of LTOT used during rest and exertion. Controlled trials have also evaluated the impact of supplemental oxygen when used during exertion only. Among patients who have COPD with a resting PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;60 mmHg (ie, are unlikely to derive a mortality benefit from LTOT), supplemental oxygen improved dyspnea and the distance walked during a five-minute walk test compared to supplemental air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the results of this study do not support general application of long-term oxygen in this patient population. In addition, recovery time following exertion was shorter among the patients who received oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no direct evidence that LTOT has adverse effects in patients with COPD when administered correctly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, there are reasonable concerns about potential toxicities in patients administered oxygen in high concentrations (above 50 percent) for extended time periods. Absorptive atelectasis, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and peripheral vasoconstriction that may limit oxygen transport to the cells are possible hazards to hyperoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Clinical experience has provided little support for these concerns in the setting of LTOT leading to a reassuring conclusion that the benefits outweigh the risks. While this tradeoff may be true for low-flow oxygen, there has been no fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) threshold identified for the possible deleterious effects of oxygen toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As there is little to be gained from increasing the LTOT FiO<sub>2</sub> to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> &gt;92 percent, it would be reasonable to target the SpO<sub>2</sub> to 90 to 92 percent. This would prevent tissue hypoxia while minimizing any deleterious effects, which might accompany delivery of enriched oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. More definitive studies are required to fully understand how enriched oxygen interacts with cells in the body under a variety of different circumstances. </p><p>Facial and upper airway burns are an infrequent complication of LTOT, but can be severe and potentially life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. The main cause of burns is exposure to open flames (eg, gas stove, candle, matches) while wearing supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, spontaneous combustion may occur following exposure to a spark source rather than an open flame. It is hypothesized that certain factors contribute to the risk of combustion in the absence of open flames, such as facial hair and use of hair products containing oils or alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a case series of patients with burns related to LTOT, seven of eight patients had facial hair. </p><p>Patients should be reminded not to smoke while using supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], to keep oxygen at least six feet (two meters) away from any open flame, and to be cautious about exposure to sources of sparks. The safety of electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes, personal vaporizers, or electronic nicotine delivery systems) in the setting of LTOT has not been formally evaluated, but the use of a heat source adjacent to high concentrations of oxygen is concerning and further study is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for continuous long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for patients with chronic lung disease include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76543 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) less than or equal to 55 mmHg (7.32 kPa), or a pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) less than or equal to 88 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PaO<sub>2</sub> less than or equal to 59 mmHg (7.85 kPa), or an SpO<sub>2</sub> less than or equal to 89 percent, if there is evidence of cor pulmonale, right heart failure, or erythrocytosis (hematocrit &gt;55 percent)</p><p/><p>For patients with normal awake oxygenation, oxygen may be prescribed during sleep if any of the following occur during sleep: the PaO<sub>2</sub> is 55 mmHg or less, the SpO<sub>2</sub> is 88 percent or less, the PaO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 10 mmHg (1.33 kPa), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the SpO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 5 percent with signs or symptoms of nocturnal hypoxemia (eg, impaired cognitive function, morning headaches, restlessness, or insomnia).

Performed along with pulse oximetry, ABGs will help to confirm the accuracy of the SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow rate&nbsp;during rest &ndash; The flow of oxygen needed to correct hypoxemia should be determined by measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> when LTOT is initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73572 \">table 3</a>). The threshold PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> that optimally improves survival and quality of life is not known. One of the early studies that demonstrated increased survival among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who received LTOT raised the mean PaO<sub>2</sub> to 71.3 mmHg (9.48 kPa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT), the investigators attempted to maintain the PaO<sub>2</sub> between 60 and 80 mmHg (7.98 to 10.64 kPa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 to 65 mmHg (7.98 to 8.65 kPa) or an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90 to 92 percent is generally considered to be acceptable. This represents clinically &quot;adequate&quot; correction of hypoxemia for most patients and is unlikely to cause significant CO<sub>2</sub> retention. However, high flow oxygen may cause CO<sub>2</sub> retention and possible oxygen toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow rate during exercise &ndash; It is common for patients with COPD who qualify for LTOT and experience hypoxemia at rest to desaturate further during usual activities of daily living, such as walking. As a result, higher oxygen flows are often necessary during exertion. It is therefore important to determine the exercise oxygen prescription while the patient is walking and to include this information in the oxygen prescription. The difference in oxygen flow necessary to correct hypoxemia at rest and during exercise may be magnified when some of the oxygen conserving devices are being used, especially those that utilize an oxygen pulsing device delivering oxygen intermittently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. An additional consideration is the use of hyperoxia to improve ventilation, reduce dyspnea, and enable the patient to exercise longer or at higher intensity during training programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/28,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36</a>]. Therefore, not only should patients be evaluated for desaturation (hypoxemia), but other outcomes such as dyspnea and exercise improvement during exercise on various O<sub>2</sub> liter flows regardless of a desaturation response. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Exercise training'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With increased availability of finger pulse oximeters, it is commonly recommended that patients titrate their own oxygen flow setting to a target SpO<sub>2</sub>. Considering that some inexpensive oximeters may provide inaccurate readings, it is important that the oximeter purchased is accurate and calibrated against arterial blood gases. This is easily accomplished by having the patient bring the oximeter with them to the clinic and validating against clinic measures (eg, the clinics oximeter or preferably arterial blood gas measures).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow rate during sleep &ndash; Among patients prescribed LTOT for daytime hypoxemia, clinicians should determine if higher flows of oxygen are necessary to prevent nocturnal oxygen desaturation. The importance of nocturnal desaturation is uncertain since some persons have oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep without daytime sequelae. Nevertheless, most clinicians managing patients who qualify for LTOT because of daytime hypoxemia adjust the flow rate to prevent hypoxemia during sleep. As an example, the oxygen flow was routinely increased by one <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> during sleep in the NOTT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Some patients who do not qualify for oxygen when awake may require oxygen therapy during sleep. As many as 30 percent of patients with COPD who have no daytime hypoxemia experience desaturation during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In those patients with COPD who have cor pulmonale, right heart failure, or erythrocytosis without evidence of hypoxemia while awake, any period of prolonged desaturation during sleep may potentially be detrimental. Thus, nocturnal monitoring of hypoxemic events and titration of supplemental oxygen are advised. Some patients may have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in addition to their COPD, as a cause of nocturnal desaturation. Overnight polysomnography can help clarify whether OSA is playing a role, and affected patients should be treated for their OSA.

For highly active and mobile patients, the clinician should order ambulatory liquid oxygen, a lightweight aluminum or fiber-wrapped ambulatory cylinder, or a portable oxygen concentrator. Each of these systems may be combined with an oxygen conserving device or transtracheal catheter to substantially increase the functional time and reduce the size and weight of the unit that the patient carries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This requires the clinician to order portable oxygen with or without an oxygen conserving technology, in addition to a stationary LTOT system, although in some cases a portable oxygen concentrator will serve as the stationary as well as the portable system. The proper prescription depends on the individual needs of the patient. The DME supplier might not provide patients with the best available technology unless the clinician has the knowledge and ability to prescribe it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portable-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-conserving-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portable oxygen delivery and oxygen conserving devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Portable oxygen is reimbursed if the Medicare patient is mobile in the home and regularly goes beyond the limits of a stationary oxygen delivery system with 50 feet of tubing. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in the United States, does not consider travel outside of the home in making this determination and also does not recognize a distinction between portable and ambulatory oxygen. The distinction made by the pulmonary community is that ambulatory oxygen delivery systems should weigh less than 10 lbs (4.5 kg) and be easily carried by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This 10 lbs limit is high enough to encompass the use of several portable oxygen concentrators; several portable gas, concentrator, and liquid systems weigh less than 5 lbs. These units should be provided for patients who are highly mobile and active.</p><p>Twenty-pound E cylinders on a two-wheeled stroller cannot be carried by the patient and are difficult to maneuver on stairs and on public or private vehicles of transportation. These E cylinders may be prescribed for patients who are less mobile and leave the home only occasionally, or who require the higher storage capability of these cylinders. Additionally, E-cylinders are typically placed in the patient's home as an emergency backup in the event the primary O<sub>2</sub> delivery system fails.</p><p>Oxygen is reimbursed on a prospective payment basis by CMS, and there is no Medicare requirement concerning the type of equipment being provided by the home oxygen supplier. CMS considers all oxygen delivery systems to be equal and &quot;modality neutral&quot; for the purpose of reimbursement. For patients who require portable systems, there is a small additional reimbursement for a &quot;portable add on&quot; device, which must be ordered by the clinician. The portable device provided to the patient will be tested during ambulation by an independent respiratory therapist to assure adequate oxygenation during activity by that device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Certification of Medical Necessity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicare and most third party carriers will cover home oxygen and oxygen equipment under durable medical equipment benefits when oxygen is considered reasonable and necessary for patients with significant hypoxemia who satisfy all medical documentation, laboratory evidence, and health conditions specified by the Social Security Administration.

Patients who continue to smoke or use e-cigarettes while using oxygen create a hazard to themselves, their families, and other occupants of buildings where they live.</p><p>Patients should be asked about their patterns of oxygen use to determine whether they are adhering to the oxygen prescription. Some patients may discontinue LTOT because they feel that they are doing better, do not want to become &quot;addicted&quot; to oxygen, or do not want to be seen using their supplemental oxygen. Reassurance can be provided regarding the benefits of LTOT in the setting of hypoxemia and the absence of &quot;addiction&quot; to oxygen. Patients sometimes adjust their oxygen use or flow rate based on symptoms. As the presence or absence of dyspnea is not a good substitute for measurement of pulse oxygen saturation, patients should be encouraged to use LTOT as prescribed.</p><p>Oxygen should not be continued if the patient is unwilling to use it, and advanced ambulatory equipment should not be supplied if the patient is unwilling or unable to be physically active. All patients receiving LTOT must be recertified every 12 months; retesting of PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> is not required by Medicare but may be required by other third party payers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">REIMBURSEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not pay for oxygen as medication. Rather, CMS classifies oxygen and oxygen delivery equipment as durable medical equipment (DME); this definition allows oxygen to be reimbursed as a form of &quot;medical equipment.&quot; As a result, a specific Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) called the CMS 484 must be completed by the clinician in order for oxygen therapy to be reimbursed at a level of 80 percent of the Medicare allowable charge. The patient or the supplemental insurance provider is responsible for the remaining 20 percent of the cost. For patients not requiring oxygen at rest but prescribed ambulatory oxygen, the clinician must document three SpO<sub>2</sub> readings: on room air at rest, with exercise, and on the prescribed oxygen setting during exertion. </p><p>Most third party payers also utilize the requirements for medical necessity established by CMS. These requirements are based primarily on the parameters for entry into the multicenter Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Indications and guidelines for therapy have been further refined by six national consensus conferences on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/31,39,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39,42-45</a>]. These guidelines apply not only to hypoxemic patients with COPD, but also to patients whose hypoxemia is due to other disorders, such as chronic interstitial lung disease, chest wall disease, lung cancer, and cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Within these guidelines, it is the clinician's responsibility to be involved in selection of appropriate equipment and provision of an individualized prescription that must be transmitted to the DME provider (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56045 \">figure 3</a>). The prescription must contain several required elements including a specified diagnosis of the disease requiring supplemental oxygen, liter oxygen flow and any changes that may be required for sleep, exercise or other condition, frequency and duration of use, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the issuance of portable oxygen devices. &quot;Oxygen PRN&quot; or &quot;Oxygen as needed&quot; do not qualify. The clinician is now instructed not to sign the CMS form (484) unless the provider has correctly restated the prescription in Section C. Periodically, the clinician will need to recertify the patient for supplemental oxygen and this recertification must be completed within a specified period of time to ensure that oxygen is provided without interruption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194179371\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS APPROVED BY CMS AND SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSITITUE (NHLBIH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover the home use of oxygen as outlined in Section 240.2 of the CMS National Coverage Determinations Manual for beneficiaries with a PaO<sub>2</sub> from 55 to 65 mmHg or an oxygen saturation at or above 89 percent when they are enrolled in clinical trials sponsored and approved by CMS and co-sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

Although transtracheal oxygen therapy is a more invasive alternative, patient acceptance has been exceptionally good and compliance with therapy is substantially enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This is a technology that may be underutilized, but it does require patient education as well as organization and commitment by the clinician and his or her staff.

In a systematic review of trials in patients with interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], two trials that examined the effect of supplemental oxygen during exertion found no benefit in exercise capacity or dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], while a third found an increase in endurance time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, oxygen saturation was not always monitored during exercise. A trial of supplemental oxygen during cycle ergometry in patients with COPD and exercise-hypoxemia reported that oxygen during exercise enabled patients to tolerate higher training intensity and increased exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Patients with a resting room air pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &lt;92 percent at sea level are candidates for supplemental oxygen during air travel. Patients with a resting room air SpO<sub>2</sub> between 92 and 95 percent at sea level need further assessment to determine the need for oxygen in-flight.
