Determining whether there is underlying constipation is an important step in the evaluation of a child with fecal incontinence because it directly affects treatment approaches. In many cases, the constipation is well recognized before the child presents with fecal incontinence. In other children presenting with fecal incontinence, the underlying constipation is not recognized by the family and is only identified after a focused history and physical examination is performed. </p><p>The definition, clinical manifestations, and evaluation of fecal incontinence will be discussed here.

Another population-based study reported prevalence rates of 4 percent in children 4 to 17 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>About 80 percent of children with fecal incontinence have underlying constipation (categorized as retentive fecal incontinence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Conversely, fecal incontinence is a common symptom of constipation. In a study of 418 constipated children, 68 percent of boys and 52 percent of girls presented with fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Functional constipation and associated fecal incontinence is particularly common among children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] and autism spectrum disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>About 20 percent of children with fecal incontinence do not have underlying constipation (categorized as nonretentive fecal incontinence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This proportion varies among studies depending on the population and diagnostic criteria; in one study, only five percent of children with fecal incontinence met criteria for the nonretentive form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The disorder is about four times more common in boys as compared with girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional constipation is associated with several types of environmental triggers. In particular, there are three periods in which the developing child is particularly prone to develop constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The first occurs after the introduction of cereals and solid food into the infant's diet, the second with toilet training, and the third during the start of school. Other common triggers are psychosocial stressors such as separation from parents or schedule changes. The pathophysiology of functional constipation is discussed in detail separately. Any of these triggers can lead to a painful, frightening, or otherwise distressing experience associated with defecation. Because the child wishes to avoid repeating this experience, he or she refrains from evacuation (&quot;stool-withholding&quot;), which further contributes to the constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H703999406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.) </p><p>The triggers and pathophysiology that cause functional constipation are also associated with the development of retentive fecal incontinence. It is not clear why fecal incontinence develops in some children with constipation and not in others. Among children with constipation, there are no clear differences in pathophysiology or psychology between those with and without fecal incontinence. In both groups, constipation in children is frequently triggered by dietary changes, psychosocial stressors such as separation or schedule changes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral adaptations such as stool withholding. </p><p>The causes of nonretentive fecal incontinence remain unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As for functional constipation, there is some association with behavioral and attention problems including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] and autism spectrum disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], as well as with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Soiling episodes are generally linked to certain persons or situations (eg, visits to a divorced parent), suggesting that there are specific triggers for the acute soiling episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, up to 40 percent of children have never been toilet trained properly, suggesting that there is a long-standing underlying physical or environmental cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is unclear whether the associated psychosocial problems are a cause or consequence of the incontinence. Fecal incontinence appears to be somewhat more common in children with a history of sexual abuse compared with the general population, and has also been reported in children referred for psychiatric problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, although some cases of fecal incontinence are associated with emotional stress, the isolated symptom of fecal incontinence does not appear to be a marker for sexual abuse. &#160;</p><p>Nonretentive fecal incontinence also can result from surgical resection of the rectosigmoid colon, eg, in children following pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or following surgery for imperforate anus, especially in patients who have suboptimal anal sphincter pressure. Proctitis may cause urgency and fecal incontinence and can usually be distinguished by its acute or subacute onset and associated rectal bleeding. Proctitis in children usually results from inflammatory bowel disease but may also be due to cow's milk protein intolerance, infection or radiation injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with fecal incontinence most commonly present with repeated soiling of their underwear. Parents may mistake this type of soiling for diarrhea, although its link to chronic constipation has become increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The child frequently denies both the visible and olfactory signs of soiling of their underwear. The child may appear oblivious or nonchalant about the problem even though it may be a source of considerable embarrassment and confusion for the child, frustration for the parents, and a cause of social stigmatization among peers. In some cases, the episodes appear to be triggered by emotional stress; this is somewhat more likely in the nonretentive form of fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H703999406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms may coexist with fecal incontinence. In one series, more than one-half of children had abdominal pain ranging in quality from vague chronic discomfort to severe attacks several days before a large bowel movement or even daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Disordered urination is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In one report, 29 percent of children had daytime wetting and 34 percent had nighttime wetting, while 33 percent of girls and 3 percent of boys had urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Behavioral changes may be disclosed during the history, including sexual acting out, aggression, depression, eating disturbances, and regression. If there are any concerns of sexual abuse, it is important for the clinician to carefully obtain and record the child's statements since physical findings are often within normal limits; referral to an appropriately trained child psychologist should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Exclude organic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should evaluate for organic disorders that may be associated with the incontinence by causing underlying constipation, affect sphincter control, or interfere with regular toileting habits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Fecal soiling is frequently observed in children with cerebral palsy, hypotonia, or intellectual disability (mental retardation). Congenital anterior displacement of the anus (ectopic anus) also can result in constipation and fecal incontinence. Rarely, new onset fecal incontinence is caused by progressive neurological disease, which might be indicated by muscle weakness or back pain. Abnormalities of the spinal cord such as tethered cord (spinal cord dysraphism) or spina bifida also may cause fecal soiling, which sometimes occurs in the absence of other neurological symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although Hirschsprung disease occasionally causes constipation in children, it is unlikely in a child with fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704003529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>A subset of children who have undergone pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung disease develop fecal incontinence due to resection of the rectosigmoid colon, which is the storage region for stool. In these patients, high amplitude colon contractions can propagate right up to the anal verge, and the frequency of high amplitude colon contractions can also be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These patients tend to present with history of passing multiple soft and painless bowel movements every day and can have associated urgency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence of constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical to distinguish between children in whom the fecal incontinence is related to constipation and those with nonretentive fecal incontinence or incontinence following colorectal surgery because the treatment will differ. The constipation may be obvious and well-recognized before the child presents with fecal incontinence. In other cases, the symptoms of constipation are subtle and have not been previously recognized by the family. Even if constipation is initially excluded, parents and provider should remain vigilant for new evidence of constipation.</p><p>Valuable information to determine if there is underlying constipation includes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intervals between bowel movements and amount, diameter, and consistency of the stool deposited into the toilet and of stools deposited into the underwear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Many children with underlying constipation will have episodes of incontinence during sleep, whereas more often children with functional nonretentive fecal incontinence will have episodes during the afternoon and evening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychosocial precipitants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the psychosocial context in which the problem arose may provide clues to whether there is underlying constipation and whether there are psychosocial stressors that either exacerbate the problem or interfere with treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of events that may have precipitated the onset of symptoms. Common triggers for constipation and encopresis include toilet training, separation (eg, starting school or divorce), or other emotional stressors, or a change in the child's daily schedule that may have interfered with regular toileting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's relationships with family members, peers, people at school, and adults with whom he or she comes into contact. The answers can disclose an important influence on the child's toileting behavior. In some cases, they reveal a hidden starting point for his or her constipation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fecal incontinence. Careful questioning may reveal a troublesome, threatening, or confusing event associated with certain important persons (power figures such as a parent or teacher), places (such as the school and school bathroom), events (such as parental divorce), or things, such as the toilet itself. A history of sexually acting out behavior can be a marker for sexual abuse, and warrants referral for further psychiatric evaluation, if not already done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination for a child with fecal incontinence is similar to that for a child with constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830 \">table 3</a>), except that the clinician should be particularly alert for signs of neurologic dysfunction. An abdominal fecal mass, indicating underlying constipation, can be palpated in about one-half of the children with fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/functional-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this group of patients, a digital examination of the rectum should be performed if at all possible. By contrast, a digital examination is not routinely needed for some patients with functional constipation. The rectum is significantly dilated and packed with stool in more than 90 percent of children with underlying functional constipation, except in those who have recently had a large bowel movement. Reduced tone of the anal sphincter as assessed during the digital examination suggests either fecal retention (with inhibition of resting sphincter tone) or a disease involving the sphincter (or both). A patulous anal canal suggests an underlying neurological disorder or can be due to surgical repair of imperforate anus. </p><p>Examination of the perineum and perianal area may reveal fecal material, anal irritation, or fissures. Ectopic or anterior displacement of the anus can be diagnosed on inspection of the perineum by observing the relationship of the perineal pigmentation to the anus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78404 \">figure 1</a>). Examination of the lower back for a sacral dimple, excess hair, or lipoma might indicate a form of closed spinal dysraphism (spina bifida occulta), which may cause fecal incontinence because of neurologic impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'External examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H2828285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous'</a>.)</p><p>On neurological examination, using a cotton swab to elicit an anal wink tests the perianal sensation and function.

In those with suspected nonretentive fecal incontinence, the radiograph helps to confirm there is no occult constipation. In those with known constipation, an abdominal radiograph can be useful to estimate the extent of impaction and also to exclude lower spine abnormalities. Radiography is particularly useful in children without a palpable fecal mass (which may be difficult to appreciate in obese children) and in those who do not permit a rectal examination. However, it should be recognized that plain films are not particularly specific for constipation, are inconsistently interpreted by different clinicians, and rarely add value to the diagnosis if the rectal examination reveals a large amount of retained stool.

However, certain tests may be appropriate if an underlying cause of the constipation is suspected based on the history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998 \">table 2</a>). Tests may include celiac serology, thyroid stimulating hormone, electrolytes and calcium, or blood lead level, depending on the child's clinical characteristics. A urine culture is appropriate if the child has enuresis or daytime wetting. In addition, laboratory testing is appropriate for patients who fail to respond to an appropriate and carefully administered intervention program, including disimpaction, frequent and effective use of laxatives, and behavioral management.

Children with fecal incontinence frequently deny knowledge of stool in their underwear and give the impression they are unable to sense the need to defecate. Because the stool smear is usually soft, parents often presume that the child has diarrhea, even when there is underlying constipation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 80 percent of children with functional fecal incontinence have underlying constipation. The symptoms of constipation may be obvious and well recognized by the family, or may be subtle. Evaluation and management of these children is similar to that of other children with functional constipation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and diagnostic criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of constipation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 20 percent of children with functional fecal incontinence have no evidence of underlying constipation, termed &quot;nonretentive fecal incontinence&quot;. The pathophysiology of this disorder is not clear, but there is a strong association with psychosocial triggers and dysfunction. The treatment of nonretentive functional fecal incontinence is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment#H213257122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment of nonretentive fecal incontinence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of children with fecal incontinence should seek to exclude organic causes of the symptom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998 \">table 2</a>) and to determine if there is underlying constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830 \">table 3</a>). If the history and physical examination (including a digital exam) do not show evidence of constipation, radiographic imaging should be performed to confirm that there is no occult constipation.
