Middle ear disease may be due, at least in part, to failure or inadequacy of eustachian tube function.</p><p>There is no well-accepted definition of eustachian tube dysfunction, but it is commonly understood to mean that the eustachian tube has failed to provide adequate ventilation to the middle ear. However, this imprecise definition excludes the common condition of a patulous (chronically patent) eustachian tube. Eustachian tube dysfunction is more accurately defined as failure of the functional valve of the eustachian tube to open <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> close properly.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of eustachian tube dysfunction. Specific diseases associated with eustachian tube dysfunction are discussed elsewhere.

The eustachian tube runs from the anterior wall of the middle ear cavity to open into the nasopharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66873 \">figure 1</a>). The nasopharyngeal and tympanic ends are wider than the middle of the tube, with the bony isthmus being the narrowest portion. The eustachian tube passes superiorly, posteriorly, and laterally from the nasopharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Its total length in adults ranges 36 to 38 mm. Children have shorter, more horizontal tubes, immature floppy elastic cartilage, and larger adenoids compared with adults, which place them at a higher risk for obstruction and reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions and pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63920 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The eustachian tube in children usually reaches adult length by age six.</p><p>The eustachian tube is not just a static pipe; it is a dynamic organ having a lumen, skeleton, mucosal lining, and surrounding soft tissue and muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70595\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70595 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The skeleton of the tube is formed of cartilage in its inferior and medial two-thirds, and bone in the superior and lateral one-third. The bony portion lies within the petrous part of the temporal bone, while the cartilaginous portion is firmly attached superiorly to the sphenoid bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The bony portion is normally patent and does not open and close dynamically as does the cartilaginous portion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Within the bone and cartilage are the four muscles related to eustachian tube function: tensor veli palatini (TVP), levator veli palatini (LVP), tensor tympani, and salpingopharyngeus. The most important muscles for dilation are the TVP, the principal active tubal dilator, and the LVP, which sets the cartilaginous skeleton into position against which the TVP can complete the dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The anterolateral wall is membranous and consists of the luminal mucosa, submucosa, and the TVP muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lining of the eustachian tube is continuous with the rest of the respiratory tract.</p><p>Viewing the eustachian tube orifice from the nasopharynx with an endoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53444 \">picture 1</a>), the lumen lies just anterior and lateral to the posterior cushion. The adenoid pad is situated in the midline of the nasopharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11700761\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eustachian tube has three functional roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equalization of pressure across the tympanic membrane, which is considered the most important function of the eustachian tube as gas pressure homeostasis is essential for optimal hearing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protecting the middle ear from infection and reflux of nasopharyngeal contents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance of middle ear secretions</p><p/><p>These three functions are mediated by opening and closing of the eustachian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66208\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66208 \">picture 2</a>). The tube ordinarily opens with swallowing and yawning approximately 84 times per hour in the daytime, and less during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Not every swallow or yawn is accompanied with opening of the eustachian tube. However, some individuals with no symptoms of eustachian tube dysfunction fail to &quot;pop&quot; open their eustachian tubes under barometric challenges or with autoinsufflation against closed nostrils. A study using cine computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated progressive passage of an air bolus along the length of the eustachian tube in some asymptomatic individuals that only partially ventilated the ear with discrete aliquots of air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This could explain the lack of correlation between eustachian tube function testing and clinical evidence for middle ear ventilation and may indicate a need for new strategies to test eustachian tube function and evaluate need for treatment, but these results need to be verified in additional studies.</p><p>The recoiling memory properties of the cartilaginous eustachian tube, relaxing bulk of the tensor veli palatini (TVP) muscle, and pressure of neighboring extraluminal tissue cause the tube to close passively. The lumen is likely maintained closed by these factors, as well as by the surface tension of the apposed wet mucosal surfaces, all in congregate serving as a functional valve that opens intermittently for ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The valve is roughly 5 to 8 mm long in the middle of the cartilaginous portion of the tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11700640\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eustachian tube dysfunction can be separated into three pathologic processes: pressure dysregulation, impaired protective function, and diminished clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342881\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure dysregulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eustachian tube may fail to open adequately to allow for ventilation of the middle ear space, leading to pressure dysregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Failure of the eustachian tube to open generally occurs due to functional or anatomic obstruction.</p><p>Functional obstruction refers to compromise of tubal dilation in the absence of a physical blockage of the lumen. Chronic functional obstruction is most commonly due to mucosal inflammation with edema and secretions limiting the ability of the valve to open. Less commonly, failure of muscular actions may limit the dilatory ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A functionally impaired eustachian tube may be able to partially open, but the dilation may be insufficient to adequately ventilate the continually accumulating negative pressure within the middle ear. The negative pressure is induced by the chronic absorption of middle ear gases and can be exacerbated in the unnatural circumstances of descents during air travel and scuba diving. It can also occur secondary to habitual sniffing and thumb sucking with an obstructed nose. The negative pressure within the elastic eustachian tube makes it harder for the tubal muscles to dilate the lumen. Once excessively negative pressure occurs within the middle ear, it becomes a vicious cycle in which the absence of opening makes it increasingly difficult to dilate the tube, and the failure to open increases the negative pressure. Unless the cycle is stopped, pressures may exceed -400 mm H2O and cause fluid transudate to fill the vacuum. Conversely, positive middle ear pressure relative to ambient pressure, as occurs with ascending in the water or in the air, facilitates opening of the tubal lumen. A floppy tube (such as seen in young children with cleft palate, Down syndrome, and other disorders with craniofacial anomalies) will tend to compress more readily with negative middle ear pressure, impairing the ability of the tube to dilate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>True anatomic obstruction occurs infrequently and may be due to unusually severe inflammation with swelling of mucosa, a large adenoid mass, congenital or acquired stenosis, or nasopharyngeal neoplasms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344336\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired protective function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired protective function refers to reflux into the eustachian tube of nasopharyngeal pathogens, allergy-inducing proteins, gastric secretions, and sounds from one's own breathing or speaking (autophony). Reflux occurs in the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormally patent eustachian tubes due to congenital or acquired factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short, floppy eustachian tubes, as in young children and patients with craniofacial anomalies.

Nasopharyngeal obstruction, blowing the nose, and crying can induce abnormal positive pressures at the nasopharyngeal end of the tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of immune protection due to copious or viscous secretions may lead to failure to adequately expel pathogens from the middle ear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of mucosal protection from gastric enzymes and acid. Nasopharyngeal and eustachian tube mucosa also do not contain the protective proteins found in the stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344353\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of mucociliary function can result in the inability to clear viscous material and pathogens from the middle ear. Such loss can occur from bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, smoking, toxic exposure, allergic disease, and other sources of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Primary loss of mucociliary function occurs in cystic fibrosis and other ciliary dysmotility disorders. Ciliary function may be secondarily impaired in inflammatory conditions such as Samter's triad (ie, asthma, nasal polyps, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> sensitivity). Impaired clearance may also be due to an obstructive process or inadequacy of tubal pump function (eg, due to muscle failure).</p><p>Eustachian tube clearance can have postural variation as well. Venous engorgement occurs when the head is in a dependent position. This may not be physiologically significant in most people, but patients with a patulous eustachian tube (in which the valve fails to close) can find relief of their symptoms by lying supine. Seasonal variations in tubal function also occur in some patients, with eustachian tubes demonstrating better function in summer and fall than in winter and spring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342888\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eustachian tube dysfunction represents a spectrum of disorders that can be broadly placed into two etiologic categories. Failure of tubal dilatory action is termed &ldquo;dilatory dysfunction,&rdquo; and valve incompetency leading to chronic patency (stuck open) is termed &ldquo;patulous dysfunction&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dilatory dysfunction is responsible for a large proportion of otitis media and chronic ear disease and is much more common than patulous dysfunction. Patulous dysfunction can cause bothersome symptoms but generally does not lead to any significant acute illness or chronic disease.</p><p>In many cases, the etiology of eustachian tube dysfunction is not found, as the condition resolves spontaneously without ever being diagnosed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342897\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilatory dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several etiologies of dilatory failure of the eustachian tube in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any cause of inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection, usually from the adenoids, nasopharynx, nose, and sinuses.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by nasal endoscopy and audiology studies. Other tests assessing for the etiology of the dysfunction are conducted based on the clinical situation (eg, allergy testing in a patient with persistent allergic symptoms).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342918\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to inquire about specific symptoms (particularly those that may distinguish dilatory from patulous tubal dysfunction), underlying causes, and possible complications. (See <a href=\"#H1596840350\" class=\"local\">'Sequela and complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Symptoms that may accompany dilatory dysfunction include ear pain, a sensation of ear fullness or pressure, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Patients commonly describe their ear(s) as feeling &quot;plugged.&quot; The patient might also report hearing popping and snapping noises that are associated with the opening of the tube with an unusually large change of pressure. Vertigo and disequilibrium may be reported in severe cases of negative pressure or in association with otitis media. Many patients, especially children, do not complain of ear problems but are discovered to have an otitis media on routine checkups. Eustachian tube dysfunction may be suspected as a possible cause for delayed speech or language development or with failure of a school screening test for hearing.</p><p>A seven-item scoring questionnaire for eustachian tube dysfunction has been proposed and contains the following seven attributes: ear pressure, ear pain, sensation of clogging, ear symptoms with a cold or sinusitis, popping or crackling sensation, ringing in the ear, and muffled hearing. It had reasonable validity in a small sample (n = 75) to distinguish patients with and without eustachian tube dysfunction, using tympanometry as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>History can also reveal a direct cause or exacerbating factor for the eustachian tube dysfunction. Nasal itch, frequent sneezing, and rhinorrhea are symptoms of allergy. Infections are characterized by production of colored nasopharyngeal discharge. Sore throat, cough, heartburn, frequent choking, and excessive salivation suggest laryngopharyngeal reflux. Nasal obstruction might be a symptom of a mass lesion, particularly if it is unilateral. Smoking or secondhand smoking may be a contributing factor.</p><p>Eustachian tube dysfunction is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of middle ear infections. Acute otitis media episodes will be apparent having presented with fever and ear pain, but otitis media with effusion can be subtle and present with speech delays in children, hearing loss, and ear pressure or discomfort. Chronic or recurrent purulent otorrhea may indicate the presence of a tympanic membrane retraction pocket or cholesteatoma. (See <a href=\"#H1596840350\" class=\"local\">'Sequela and complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In persistent cases, the patient should be asked about habits that may precipitate or exacerbate eustachian tube dysfunction, such as habitual sniffing or forceful attempts to aerate their middle ears and relieve the sense of <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/obstruction</span>. Habitual sniffing can cause chronic negative pressure in the middle ear that leads to retraction or atelectasis of the tympanic membrane. Strong nose blows or raising nasopharyngeal pressure against a closed nose can force the eustachian tube open, but this repetition over time may distend and weaken the eustachian tube or even result in a patulous tube.</p><p>The hallmark symptom of patulous dysfunction of the eustachian tube is autophony: the patient complains about hearing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own voice and breathing sounds greatly amplified, as if &quot;talking into a barrel.&quot; Hearing one's own voice is generally more bothersome than hearing one's own breathing sounds. Symptoms of patulous dysfunction often fluctuate and may be relieved with the head in a dependent position. They can be initiated or worsened by exercise and prolonged speaking as these activities cause dehydration of mucosa, and there can be a decongestive effect from the epinephrine-like hormones released with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with patulous dysfunction may also complain of ear fullness similar to those with dilatory dysfunction. Symptoms of patulous dysfunction can vary in severity from subtle to significantly bothersome, even to the point of being disabling, although patulous dysfunction does not lead to any significant disease in the middle ear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342934\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A head and neck examination should be performed on every patient with a possible eustachian tube problem. Particular attention should be given to the ear examination as this is most likely to detect any underlying etiology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of eustachian tube dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The ear examination is done using an otoscope. Normally the tympanic membrane has a shiny translucent appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 5</a>). A dull bluish gray or yellowish coloration denotes an effusion behind the membrane. Reddish coloration and engorged vessels could be a sign of inflammation, although straining of a child during crying or blowing the nose can also lead to engorged tympanic vessels. The reflection of the light on the anteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane is not a reliable indicator of changes in the drum, as it is often present despite significant pathology. Scarring and thickening of the tympanic membrane can alter the shape of the cone of light, so the entire tympanic membrane should be evaluated systematically.</p><p>The short process of malleus is visible as a mild protrusion near the &quot;twelve-o-clock&quot; position in the healthy transparent tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 5</a>). In cases of high negative pressures, the tympanic membrane is retracted and the short process is more prominent, and the manubrium (or handle) of the malleus appears shorter because it is medially rotated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52819\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819 \">picture 6</a>). Presence of middle ear effusion may obscure the view of the short process. The fullness or retraction of the tympanic membrane is most clearly appreciated at the posterosuperior aspect, as it has the highest compliance.</p><p>The tympanic membrane is examined for any retractions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52819\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819 \">picture 6</a>), effusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67379 \">picture 7</a>), atelectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78843 \">picture 8</a>), cholesteatomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59937\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59937 \">picture 9</a>), perforations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64202 \">picture 10</a>), or tympanosclerotic plaques. Any of these signs can be associated with dilatory eustachian tube dysfunction. Normal otoscopic findings do not necessarily mean the absence of eustachian tube disease.</p><p>The examination is greatly aided with a pneumatic otoscope that allows for insufflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F93798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93798 \">picture 11</a>). With gentle application of positive and then negative pressure by the pneumatic otoscope, the normal drum moves inwards then outwards respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55117\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55117 \">movie 1</a>). The movement of the drum is most evident posterosuperiorly. A fluid-filled middle ear will minimize any tympanic membrane excursions with insufflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67928\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67928 \">movie 2</a>). When there is negative pressure within the middle ear, the retracted tympanic membrane will mobilize laterally and become more compliant with the application of negative pressure insufflation. Newborn infants have a thicker and more opaque tympanic membrane than older infants and children. Thus, care should be taken during otoscopy not to mistake them for being retracted.</p><p>When there is an actively patulous eustachian tube, excursions of the tympanic membrane will accompany the patient's breathing, especially if the opposite nostril is held closed. Lying in the supine position may temporarily close the patulous defect and stop the breathing-induced excursions.</p><p>When hearing loss is present, patients should undergo further evaluation which may include the use of tuning forks to determine whether there is conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss may occur with dilatory, but not with patulous dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other components of the physical examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal cavity should be inspected for abnormalities, including evidence of inflammation, allergic changes, masses, bleeding, granulomatous disease, and polyps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neck should be examined for enlarged lymph nodes, masses, or congenital cysts.

(See <a href=\"#H2344727\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> below.)</p><p>In our experience, it is useful to start the examination with the flexible endoscope and, if more detailed views are needed, then the rigid endoscopes may provide the optimal view. The flexible endoscope is used to survey the nasal cavity in detail and inspect the sinus orifices for inflammation, secretions, or allergic manifestations. The nasopharynx is also examined for evidence of enlarged or inflamed adenoids or other masses. The relationship of any adenoidal mass to the posterior cushion is noted to see if it may cause impingement on tubal opening at rest or with swallowing. The best view into the eustachian tubal lumen is often obtained by passing the flexible endoscope from the contralateral nares, curving around the vomer bone to come in line with the longitudinal axis of the eustachian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52732\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52732 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79152 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53444 \">picture 1</a>). Patients are asked to perform a series of swallows and yawns to assess the quality of opening of the tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66208\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66208 \">picture 2</a>). The endoscope is passed towards the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx to check for evidence of reflux, such as thickening, edema, and erythema of the vocal cords.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2342948\"><span class=\"h2\">Audiometric evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both tympanogram to measure the middle ear pressure and pure tone audiometry to assess for hearing loss are important tools in evaluation of eustachian tube dysfunction. In a child with persistent symptoms, an audiogram and tympanogram should be repeated after three months, at which time the decision to perform tympanostomy tubes may be made. In adults, a follow-up audiogram and tympanogram may be done after 3 to 12 months depending on the severity of symptoms and whether any improvement is occurring or anticipated. Persistent, severe symptoms in an adult would prompt a follow-up audiogram and tympanogram after three months with consideration for more aggressive medical care or a tympanostomy tube.</p><p>Tympanometry is a reliable instrument that determines normal versus abnormal pressures within the middle ear. Tympanometry can indirectly measure middle ear pressure by comparing changes in compliance of the tympanic membrane to changes in external ear canal pressure. The presence of middle ear effusion stiffens the system (decreases the compliance). Actively patulous eustachian tubes can sometimes be identified on tympanometry by sawtoothed changes in compliance as the patient's breathing causes shifts in middle ear pressure.</p><p>Audiometry is important in measuring the impact that eustachian tube dysfunction may have on hearing function, but it does not correlate with severity of tubal pathology. Mild to moderate conductive hearing loss is expected in cases of atelectasis and middle ear effusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344874929\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with contrast is indicated in patients with more than three months of unilateral symptoms or a middle ear effusion.

In TMJ, there can be pain deep within the ear, tenderness around the ear canal or pre-auricular area, or headaches. TMJ is also accompanied by tenderness just posteriorly and superiorly within the joint space that occurs with mouth opening. Intraoral exam will usually reveal significant tenderness over the pterygoid muscles that can be palpated where they insert into the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55205\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55205 \">picture 12</a>). Furthermore, in contrast to patients with eustachian tube dysfunction, otoscopic examination, pneumatic insufflation, and tympanometry will be normal despite the patient's active &quot;ear&quot; complaints, which should raise suspicion about the possibility of TMJ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporomandibular disorders in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease &ndash; Patients with early M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease may present with a sensation of fluctuating ear blockage, with or without accompanying fluctuating hearing loss. The ear examination and tympanometry will be normal in most cases. The diagnosis is made by observing the patient as symptoms spontaneously fluctuate over time. Audiometric testing during exacerbations may confirm the diagnosis by showing a characteristic low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. In contrast to the relatively stable symptoms of eustachian tube dysfunction over time, advanced cases of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease will be more likely to exhibit the classical episodic fluctuating symptoms of ear fullness, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Vestibular function tests may be normal early in the course of M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease, but will eventually be abnormal on the affected side.

It can present with variable symptoms that can be confused with eustachian tube dysfunction. There can be ear blockage, disequilibrium, vertigo with loud noises, conductive hearing loss, and enhanced perception of internal sounds such as one's own voice (autophony) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The diagnosis can be established with an MRI or high-resolution CT of the temporal bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The choice of management strategies for isolated eustachian tube dysfunction remains controversial as randomized trial data are limited, study outcomes vary widely between studies, and much of what is known about the treatment of eustachian tube dysfunction comes from animal rather than human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a systematic review of 34 observational studies and randomized trials assessing a variety of interventions (eg, decongestants, antibiotics, surgery), several studies demonstrated beneficial effects for some aspects of tubal function (mostly ventilatory function) and detrimental effects for others (mostly protective <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clearance functions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, there was no intervention that was consistently effective in improving tubal function. Furthermore, as the primary outcome measures in these studies were measures of tubal function, it is not clear if treatments ultimately lead to improved symptoms or prevention of illness.</p><p>In treating eustachian tube dysfunction, dilatory dysfunction should be differentiated from patulous dysfunction during the clinical evaluation. Dilatory dysfunction is best differentiated by accompanying symptoms of hearing loss and abnormalities of the tympanic membrane such as retraction or middle ear effusion. Patulous dysfunction should be suspected when the primary complaint is autophony (hearing one's own voice and breathing sounds), yet there is no complaint of hearing loss and the tympanic membrane appears normal. Clinicians may be tempted to consider patients complaining of ear blockage as having dilatory dysfunction. However, ear blockage can occur in both dilatory and patulous dysfunction. Dilatory dysfunction treatments for patulous dysfunction will fail to help and may even exacerbate the symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2342911\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2343018\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilatory dysfunction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1750696946\"><span class=\"h3\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2015 consensus statement defined eustachian tube dilatory dysfunction as insufficient dilation to perform the known functions of the eustachian tube: ventilation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, clearance of secretions from the middle ear, and protection of the ear from reflux of nasopharyngeal contents and sounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. The consequences of dilatory dysfunction are negative middle ear pressure and difficulty clearing the ears with changes in atmospheric pressure, such as with flying or diving.

A careful search for the cause with appropriate therapy is usually successful in improving eustachian tube function. There are many possible causes for dilatory dysfunction, most of which will respond to treatment. In the absence of bacterial infection, systemic decongestants (most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>), antihistamines, or nasal steroid sprays are frequently prescribed to treat presumptive viral rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis.</p><p>The most common etiologies of dilatory dysfunction and their treatments include (see <a href=\"#H2342888\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinosinusitis &ndash; Treatment for viral rhinosinusitis and mild cases of bacterial rhinosinusitis is usually directed at symptom management. Moderate to severe cases of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are usually treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Multiple therapies are utilized in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis, including intranasal saline, topical and systemic glucocorticoids, antibiotics, leukotriene inhibitors, and antifungals. These treatments are discussed in detail separately.

The decision to use pharmacotherapy varies based on patient age, severity of symptoms, and comorbidities (eg, asthma, nasal polyposis). Antihistamines, topical nasal steroid sprays or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a>, oral leukotriene inhibitors, or combinations of these treatments are commonly effective in treating allergic symptoms. Immunotherapy can be helpful in refractory cases. Counseling for smoking cessation and the hazards of secondhand smoking should also be offered to the patient. In children over six years old with otitis media with effusion, allergies should be strongly suspected. Many patients with vasomotor rhinitis may have allergies that have not been identified by testing and may respond to the above measures as well.

This includes avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, peppermints, carbonated beverages, nicotine, and spicy foods. Patients should eat smaller meals and avoid eating immediately before exercise or sleep. Patients with concomitant laryngopharyngeal and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) should be treated with proton pump inhibitors. For all other patients, in the absence of symptomatic GERD, acid-blocking therapy is generally not helpful.

Adenoid hypertrophy is the most common entity in which the adenoid either physically impairs the opening of the tubal orifice or it may contribute to inflammation within the eustachian tube. Excision of enlarged adenoids is effective in reducing the incidence of otitis media with effusion, especially in children. Tumors are uncommon but should be suspected in cases of persistent unilateral symptoms. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the most common malignancy affecting the eustachian tube, is usually treated with radiation therapy, without surgical resection.

A randomized trial in patients with eustachian tube dysfunction (negative middle ear pressure or middle ear effusion) above the age of six years, in whom the eustachian tubes have presumably reached anatomical maturity, found that six weeks of aqueous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide nasal spray did not reverse the sequelae of eustachian tube dysfunction compared with the placebo control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct steroid application</strong> &ndash; One study suggested some benefit of direct application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> through a ventilation tube that contained a MicroWick, which was placed anteriorly in the tympanic membrane directly over the eustachian tube orifice.

Tympanostomy tubes neutralize the negative pressure within the middle ear, providing relief from the effects of dilatory dysfunction. Tympanostomy tubes are effective in preventing sequela of negative pressure and, in most cases, any effusion will not recur upon extrusion of the tube. However, when tubal pathology persists, recurrence of signs and symptoms is likely to occur. Additional tubes may be performed as needed. Longer-term tympanostomy tubes may be used that typically remain in place for several years but have a higher risk for subsequent tympanic membrane perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eustachian tuboplasty</strong> &ndash; Eustachian tuboplasty is a procedure that reduces the thickness of the mucosa and submucosa of the more bulky posterior-medial wall of the tubal orifice and lumen in order to facilitate tubal dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although many patients have experienced a significant weight loss with their illness, weight gain is rarely effective and is generally not recommended unless the patient is physiologically underweight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344692\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with patulous dysfunction have often been given decongestants or nasal steroid therapy empirically, and these should be discontinued as they are not effective and may worsen symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients who have mild symptoms only require reassurance about the benign nature of patulous dysfunction. Patulous symptoms often fluctuate, depending on the patient's medical condition and any dehydration. Medical therapy should be initiated for patients having severe symptoms lasting more than six weeks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good hydration can be effective and may be supplemented by nasal saline drops as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. To achieve the best result, the drops should come in contact with the tubal orifice. Patients are instructed to raise their nose straight up, place the drops, then tilt the head to the diseased side. Saline irrigations may be tried when drops are not sufficiently effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When hydration and topical therapy are ineffective, thickening of the mucosa can be attempted using potassium iodine, 8 to 10 drops in a glass of juice, taken orally three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344699\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical management is reserved for patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to medical management (ie, treatment of underlying etiology, hydration, and potassium iodine).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tympanostomy tube insertion may be offered to patients as first-line surgical treatment, as other surgical treatments are new and not widely available. Tubes can<strong> </strong>provide some relief in approximately half of treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. They are only effective in relieving the bothersome sensation of movements of the tympanic membrane during breathing, but not in improving autophony, which is usually the main complaint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraluminal catheter placement &ndash; An intravenous catheter sealed with bone wax is a method to block the wide eustachian tube by plugging its lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72681 \">picture 14</a>). The catheter wedges into the isthmus but does not completely obstruct the tube, and a sufficient amount of air can be exchanged around the catheter. Several case reports show that this method can be effective in eliminating or reducing the bothersome patulous autophony in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/6,17,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,51</a>]. The catheter is inert and can stay in place for long periods of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cartilage grafting &ndash; This approach is generally used after failure of intraluminal catheters. Endoscopic approaches are used for reconstruction of the patulous defect while preserving the eustachian tube's function. The technique implants conchal or septal cartilage grafts to augment the concave defect within the anterolateral wall. Although long-term data are not yet available, patients followed for five years demonstrate that the procedure is efficacious, but some symptoms recur in about 50 percent of patients after two years of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete occlusion of the eustachian tube &ndash; Occlusion of the eustachian tube is effective in relieving symptoms, but it is only done as a last resort in patients who are intolerant of persistent symptoms despite other treatment. The ear will usually require tympanostomy tubes indefinitely in order to avoid complications of severe tympanic membrane retraction, permanent effusion, or cholesteatoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596840350\"><span class=\"h1\">SEQUELA AND COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531862\"><span class=\"h2\">Hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the initial stages of eustachian tube dysfunction, the retracted tympanic membrane or middle ear effusion will cause a conductive hearing loss. Restoration of tubal function at this stage will usually reverse the hearing loss and permit normal hearing function. If eustachian tube dysfunction continues, permanent injury may occur to the tympanic membrane from retraction, in which case full restoration of the conductive hearing loss is not always possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531869\"><span class=\"h2\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otitis media, occurring as a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction, is usually self-limited, but antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapy directed at symptom relief may be used. Antibiotic treatment is used for treatment of acute otitis media. In otitis media with effusion, topical decongestants and antihistamines are commonly used for temporary symptomatic relief, but there is little evidence that these agents are effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eustachian-tube-dysfunction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Children that continue to have recurrent otitis media should be suspected of ongoing factors that could contribute to otitis media such as allergic disease, laryngopharyngeal reflux, or immune deficiency. Treatment of otitis media is discussed in detail elsewhere.

For most patients with acute rupture of the tympanic membrane, treatment consists of antibiotics and preventing water from entering the ear canal. Patients with severe symptoms (eg, significant hearing loss, otorrhea, nystagmus) or persistent perforation should be referred to an otolaryngologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H49926436\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'AOM with perforation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14531883\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholesteatomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent inflammation within the middle ear and tympanic membrane due to eustachian tube dysfunction may lead to the formation of retraction pockets that develop retention of debris and progressive deepening of the pockets into the roof of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. This may eventually become a continually expanding cyst of squamous epithelium, known as a cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas are potentially destructive to the middle and inner ear, especially when they get infected. Cholesteatomas should be referred to an otolaryngologist for surgical removal, usually in conjunction with tympanoplasty.

Eustachian tube dysfunction can predispose to middle ear disease. (See <a href=\"#H11700761\" class=\"local\">'Normal function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11700640\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eustachian tube dysfunction represents a spectrum of disorders that can be broadly placed into two etiologic categories. Failure of tubal dilatory action is termed &quot;dilatory dysfunction,&quot; and valve incompetency leading to chronic patency (stuck open) is termed &quot;patulous dysfunction.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2342888\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eustachian tube dysfunction is a clinical diagnosis, mainly based on history and physical examination. Dilatory dysfunction should be differentiated from patulous dysfunction during the clinical evaluation, as medical therapies differ. Dilatory dysfunction is best differentiated by accompanying symptoms of hearing loss and abnormalities of the tympanic membrane such as retraction or middle ear effusion. Patulous dysfunction should be suspected when the primary complaint is autophony (hearing one's own voice and breathing sounds), yet there is no complaint of hearing loss and the tympanic membrane appears normal. The diagnosis can be confirmed by nasal endoscopy and audiology studies. A head and neck examination should be performed in patients with a possible eustachian tube problem. Particular attention should be given to the ear examination, as this is most likely to detect any underlying etiology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of eustachian tube dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2342911\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of eustachian tube dysfunction should be directed at the underlying etiology, if known. There are many causes of dilatory dysfunction (including rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and tumors) that will respond to specific treatment. In the absence of an underlying cause of dilatory dysfunction, systemic decongestants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> may be helpful for congestive symptoms (eg, ear fullness or pressure). Patients should be counseled not to exceed three days of nasal decongestant treatment in order to avoid nasal mucosal dependency and rhinitis medicamentosa. (See <a href=\"#H2343018\" class=\"local\">'Dilatory dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical management of patients with patulous dysfunction includes hydration and mucus-thickening agents. Decongestants should be avoided because they are not effective and may worsen symptoms. Surgical management includes tympanostomy tube insertion, cartilage grafting, intraluminal catheter placement, and complete occlusion of the eustachian tube. (See <a href=\"#H2343040\" class=\"local\">'Patulous dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of eustachian tube dysfunction include hearing loss, otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, and cholesteatomas. (See <a href=\"#H1596840350\" class=\"local\">'Sequela and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist if they have severe symptoms (hearing loss, persistent ear pain), <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/worsening</span> symptoms or signs despite medical therapy, or complication that may require surgical treatment (eg, cholesteatoma, perforated tympanic membrane).
