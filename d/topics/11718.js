NEC can happen in all newborn babies, but is most common in premature babies.</p><p>NEC is a serious disease. A baby who has it needs treatment as soon as possible. This is because the injury can destroy parts of the intestine. This damage can be permanent. In some very sick babies, it can even cause death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080479\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of newborn necrotizing enterocolitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually happen 10 days to a few weeks after birth. Doctors usually find NEC in babies who are already in the hospital. This is because NEC usually happens in premature babies or sick babies who are born on time.</p><p>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding problems, such as: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Milk or formula that stays in the stomach, instead of going into the intestines the way it should</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the rectum</p><p/><p>Some symptoms of NEC can also happen with other conditions. These symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long pauses with no breathing (called &quot;apnea&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting sleepy a lot of the time &ndash; It can be hard to wake the baby up.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that feels too warm or too cool</p><p/><p>If the doctors and nurses taking care of your baby think he or she might have NEC, they can do an exam and treat the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080494\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can order some or all of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-ray of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound of the belly &ndash; An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of the baby's bowel movement</p><p/><p>Imaging tests such as X-ray and ultrasound show changes in the intestines caused by NEC. Blood tests and tests on a sample of bowel movement might help doctors tell if NEC is causing the symptoms or if a different condition might be the cause. Other diseases can cause symptoms like those of NEC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14080508\"><span class=\"h1\">How is necrotizing enterocolitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baby with NEC needs treatment right away. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving fluids and nutrition through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a thin tube, called a &quot;nasogastric tube,&quot; in the baby's nose, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. (The esophagus is the tube that carries food to the stomach.) If there is extra fluid and air in the stomach or intestines, the tube can suck it up. This can relieve belly swelling and help stop vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving medicines or blood transfusions to help bleeding problems or other problems &ndash; During a blood transfusion, the baby will get blood that has been donated by someone else. The donated blood goes into a vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to fight infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors can drain fluid from the belly or take out a part of the intestine that has serious damage.</p><p/><p>Babies with NEC can be very sick. During treatment, they might need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help the heart work correctly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breathing machine or oxygen to help them get enough air in the lungs</p><p/><p>Babies getting treatment for NEC will have X-rays, blood tests, and tests on a sample of bowel movement often. All these tests can show if the NEC is getting better or worse.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
