Sporadic renal AMLs and renal AMLs associated with sporadic pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-angiomyolipomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal angiomyolipomas&quot;</a>). The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of TSC are also discussed in detail elsewhere.

The gene product of <em>TSC1</em> is hamartin, and the gene product of <em>TSC2</em> is tuberin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p><em>TSC2</em> mutations generally produce a more severe phenotype than <em>TSC1</em> mutations<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This includes a higher frequency and severity of renal angiolipomas and renal cysts and a higher risk for the development of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H230287694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genotype-phenotype correlations'</a>.)</p><p><em>TSC2</em> mutations may also be associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) since the <em>TSC2</em> gene is adjacent (tail-to-tail) to the <em>PKD1</em> gene. Deletions that inactivate both genes are associated with polycystic kidneys that are most often diagnosed during the first year of life or early childhood; this disorder is called the <em>TSC2</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>PKD1</em></span> contiguous gene syndrome. By contrast, somatic mosaicism, which is well documented in TSC, can greatly attenuate both phenotypic manifestations and severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This condition is due to a TSC mutation acquired by one of multiple pluripotent stem cells during early embryogenesis and is increasingly recognized in TSC patients with no detectable mutations using next-generation sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In various series, AML have been reported in 75 to 85 percent of TSC patients with renal lesions and in 49 to 60 percent of TSC patients overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4135671\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above). AMLs belong to a family of tumors collectively referred to as &quot;neoplasms with perivascular epithelioid differentiation,&quot; which were previously called &quot;perivascular epithelioid cell tumors&quot; and now are referred to as &quot;PEComas&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These tumors arise by clonal proliferation of epithelioid cells distributed around blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and, in patients with TSC, include renal AMLs and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). A TSC-associated AML lesion may be due to clonal expansion of pericytes in the kidney that has undergone biallelic (ie, germline plus a somatic) mutations of a TSC gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among patients with TSC, the prevalence and size of renal AMLs increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/2,5,6,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,12-18</a>]. Renal AMLs are more numerous and reach a larger size in women than in men, suggesting a hormonal effect on TSC development and growth, which can also occur in prepubertal girls, who have higher estradiol levels than boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In one study of 164 children with TSC who underwent serial renal ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), there were no renal AMLs in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In contrast, renal AMLs were present in 37 percent of the children between one and five years of age and in 41 percent of boys and 63 percent of girls after five years of age.</p><p>Increasing prevalence with age has been described in older children with TSC. In a longitudinal study of 60 such patients, renal AMLs were present in 48 percent of boys and 60 percent of girls at a mean age of 6.9 years and in 76 percent of boys and 83 percent of girls at follow-up at a mean age of 10.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The overall prevalence of AMLs among patients with TSC is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H4135671\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to the increase in prevalence of renal AMLs, the number and size of renal AMLs also increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/2,5,6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the above series of children with TSC who had follow-up at a mean age of 10.5 years, growth of renal AMLs occurred in 10 of 18 boys (3 an increase in number and 7 an increase in size) and in 18 of 27 girls (17 an increase in number and all 18 an increase in size) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large series from the Netherlands (351 adult TSC patients and 244 with at least one AML &ge;3.5 cm) in which AML were classified according to size, number, and renal morphology, the median age of patients with no AML was 37 years, whereas the median age with stage 3 (ie, at least one AML &ge;3.5 cm) was 46 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F106129\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106129 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Cautious interpretation is warranted when considering these ultrasound data, however, because ultrasound often cannot detect fat-poor angiomyolipomata, and approximately a third of patients demonstrate such fat-poor lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H898939342\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major histologic types of renal AMLs associated with TSC: classic and epithelioid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90669\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90669 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/13,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,22</a>].

Epithelioid variants may undergo malignant transformation.

Thus, most patients with TSC-related AML come to attention on surveillance imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis#H314611346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Renal disease'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, patients with TSC present with a renal AML, either because of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, hematuria, or impingement of the AMLs on normal tissue, which can impair renal function.</p><p>Following are common clinical presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; The most common clinical manifestations of symptomatic renal AMLs are related to hemorrhage (hematuria, intratumoral, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage) and to their mass effect (abdominal or flank mass, flank pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenderness, hypertension, and renal insufficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/2,13,18,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,18,26,27</a>]. The chances of developing symptoms are directly related to AML size. As a rule, renal AMLs larger than 4 cm are more likely to grow, develop microaneurysms and macroaneurysms, and cause symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/13,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AMLs may cause significant and occasionally life-threatening hemorrhage. Renal AMLs are the most common cause of Wunderlich syndrome, a life-threatening, nontraumatic renal hemorrhage into the subcapsular and perirenal spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of significant hemorrhage is related to the degree of vascularity, the AML size, and the size of aneurysms within the AML. Increased vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aneurysm size (5 mm or more) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] are associated with an increased risk of AML rupture. The risk of bleeding may rise during pregnancy, possibly due to rapid growth induced by hormonal changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic kidney disease (CKD</strong>) &ndash; Some patients develop significant renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), due to destruction of renal tissue related to extensive bilateral renal AMLs. (See <a href=\"#H4135706\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia</strong> &ndash; Anemia is common. In the series from the Netherlands, anemia was present in 60 percent of patients overall and positively correlated with the size and number of AMLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> &ndash; Hypertension is often observed. Hypertension is less common in patients who only have renal AMLs compared with patients who have renal cysts with or without AMLs. Hypertension correlates with the size and number of AMLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51091881\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant renal epithelioid angiomyolipomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the uniformly benign prognosis of classic renal AMLs, epithelioid variants may undergo malignant transformation, although this is infrequent. Malignant transformation is manifested by local recurrence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal metastases. The relative risk is greater in patients with TSC, but most patients with malignant transformation have sporadic renal AMLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4135833\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566151197\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of renal AMLs is usually made by imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], CT, or ultrasound) and relies on the demonstration of the tumor. We generally usually use MRI for the initial screen and use ultrasound alternating with MRI to monitor growth, depending on findings. It is occasionally difficult to get good-quality MRI without motion artifact unless general anesthesia is used among patients with cognitive impairment. Ultrasound should be followed up with MRI if a lesion is detected. The international guideline recommends MRI for diagnosis and imaging every one to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The fat, if present, appears hyperechogenic on ultrasound; has a low attenuation value on CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50146\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50146 \">image 1</a>); and, with MRI, appears bright on T1-weighted images, dark on T2-weighted images with fat saturation, and intermediate on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/6,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,36-39</a>]. The early, small lesions have a characteristic radial, striated, or wedge-shaped pattern, with the base of the wedge facing the surface of the kidney. As the AMLs grow, there may be a mass effect within the renal parenchyma, or they can become exophytic (ie, grow outward).</p><p>The diagnostic accuracy often depends upon the amount of fat tissue in the tumor. A potential source of error in the interpretation of imaging studies is that small amounts of fat can be found within the borders of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) that invade renal sinus fat (which is the major differential diagnosis to AMLs). The demonstration of fat occasionally leads to misinterpretation of an RCC as an AML. In addition, approximately 5 percent of renal AMLs contain at least components with minimal amounts of fat and are called minimal fat or fat poor. It is difficult to distinguish fat-poor AML (either classic AML [predominantly composed of smooth muscle cells] or epithelioid AML) from RCC and oncocytoma. Failure to detect fat in an AML may also be due to intratumoral hemorrhage obscuring the fat attenuation signal. (See <a href=\"#H4135692\" class=\"local\">'Renal cell carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific radiographic criteria have been proposed that define fat-rich, fat-poor, and fat-invisible AML based on quantitative values observed on CT and MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A fat-invisible AML (defined by CT attenuation greater than -10 HU and an MRI tumor-to-spleen ratio of 0.71 or greater and a signal intensity index of 16.5 percent or less) requires biopsy for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The approach to fat-poor AML, defined by attenuation of more than -10 HU on CT images but with an MRI tumor-to-spleen ratio less than 0.71 or a signal intensity index greater than 16.5 percent, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Often, combining imaging modalities can be helpful.</p><p>Several findings on CT, MRI, and <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/positron</span> emission tomography (PET) may help to distinguish renal AMLs with no or minimal fat from RCC. These include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90668\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90668 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjacent fat attenuation pixels within the lesion by thin-section unenhanced CT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homogeneously high attenuation on unenhanced CT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homogeneous and prolonged enhancement pattern on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low T2 signal intensity on MRI</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic fat on in-phase and opposed-phase gradient echo MR sequences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homogeneous signal on diffusion-weighted MRI</p><p/><p>Other tests have also been evaluated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combining tumor to renal cortex signal intensity ratios on T1- and T2-weighted images, signal intensities on in- and opposed-phase gradient echo MRIs, and arterial-to-delayed enhancement ratio has been reported to differentiate AML without visible fat from RCC with 73 percent sensitivity, 99 percent specificity, and 96 percent accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual-tracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 11C-acetate <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> have been reported to differentiate fat-poor AMLs from RCC with 94 percent sensitivity, 98 percent specificity, and 97 percent accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy using a sheath technique should be considered as an alternative to surgical exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The risk of bleeding following needle biopsy of a minimal-fat AML does not appear to be higher than that of a biopsy for other renal tumors, particularly when fine needles are used.</p><p>The differentiation of renal AML from RCC has become more reliable with the aid of immunocytochemical analysis. Melanocytic markers such as HMB-45 and melan A are expressed in classic and epithelioid renal AMLs but not in typical RCC, while epithelial cell-associated markers such as cytokeratin and EMA are present in RCC but not in renal AMLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/21,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,48-50</a>].</p><p>An exception to this distinction occurs in rare RCCs characterized by t(6;11)(p21;q12), a chromosome translocation involving the gene for transcription factor EB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. These carcinomas consistently express HMB-45 and melan A, are often negative or only focally positive for cytokeratin, and are more common in children and young adults in the general population but would be exceedingly rare in the TSC population given the frequencies of the diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4135840\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnoses of AML include other renal masses detected by imaging, including RCC and oncocytoma, and metastatic lesions from primary tumors elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H4135692\" class=\"local\">'Renal cell carcinoma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4135699\" class=\"local\">'Oncocytoma'</a> below.)</p><p>These entities are usually distinguished from each other by characteristic radiographic features (see <a href=\"#H566151197\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic diagnosis'</a> above). However, as noted above, the diagnosis may be challenging among patients with minimal-fat AMLs; such patients may require biopsy with analysis of tissue using specific immunohistochemical techniques. (See <a href=\"#H4210732874\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>The rate of growth of the lesion may help to differentiate a slowly growing, benign AML from a more rapidly growing RCC. However, data are limited.

Women may require more frequent imaging if they are pregnant or starting estrogen therapy. In patients with known renal lesions, the serum creatinine should be measured at least once per year. (See <a href=\"#H4135862\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance for small, stable lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4390538\" class=\"local\">'Potential issues in women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H241537943\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge William M Bennett, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dabora SL, Jozwiak S, Franz DN, et al.
