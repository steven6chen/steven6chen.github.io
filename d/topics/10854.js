Estrogen is the most effective treatment available for relief of menopausal symptoms, most importantly, hot flashes. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT, estrogen alone or combined with a progestin) is currently indicated for management of menopausal symptoms.</p><p>An overview of the risks and benefits of MHT will be provided here. The management of women with hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms is reviewed in greater detail separately.

It is highly effective for the management of hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, and, in some cases, the mood lability that many women experience during the menopausal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Similar to most other guidelines, the Endocrine Society agrees that MHT is indicated for the management of menopausal symptoms but not for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The benefits of MHT appear to outweigh its risks for most symptomatic women who are either under age 60 years or less than 10 years from menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The approach to managing menopausal symptoms with MHT and nonhormonal alternatives is reviewed separately.

However, data from the WHI, a set of two hormone therapy (HT) trials (unopposed estrogen and continuous, combined estrogen-progestin therapy versus placebo) in approximately 27,000 postmenopausal women (mean age 63 years), showed a number of adverse outcomes, including an excess risk of CHD, stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Similar results were noted in a meta-analysis of 22 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and an updated 2017 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) meta-analysis of 18 trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Both included the WHI, and the mean age of subjects was &gt;60 years. In the USPSTF analysis, results were largely based upon the WHI. Based upon their current meta-analysis, the USPSTF continues to recommend against the use of both combined estrogen and progestin and unopposed estrogen (for women posthysterectomy) for the prevention of chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. However, they do not address the use of MHT for menopausal symptoms, nor do they present the WHI data showing the low absolute risks of MHT in younger menopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H507693\" class=\"local\">'Estimates of risk in women 50 to 59 years'</a> below.)</p><p>Many expert groups do suggest MHT for younger postmenopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms and no contraindications to estrogen use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. In the past, some experts advised that MHT be limited to five years of use. However, hot flashes can last a decade or more in many women. Therefore, some professional societies now suggest that longer therapy is reasonable in select women with persistent symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy#H352145522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Duration of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>While the WHI clearly demonstrated the adverse effects of MHT in older postmenopausal women (over age 60 years), this is not the age group that presents with new onset of menopausal symptoms. Almost all women who seek medical therapy for menopausal symptoms do so in their late 40s or 50s. (See <a href=\"#H507693\" class=\"local\">'Estimates of risk in women 50 to 59 years'</a> below.)</p><p>When counseling women about MHT, the clinician should provide estimates for the absolute risks and benefits for up to five years of treatment in young postmenopausal women (eg, &lt;10 years postmenopausal or ages 50 to 59 years). Women should be reassured that the absolute risk of complications for healthy, young postmenopausal women taking HT for five years is very low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168740212\"><span class=\"h3\">Decline in MHT use: Health and economic impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) decreased significantly in the decade after publication of the WHI results in 2002. In a report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), use of oral MHT in the United States in women over age 40 decreased from 22 percent in 1999 to 2002 to 12 percent in 2003 to 2004, reaching a low of 4.7 percent in 2009 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This continued decline occurred in spite of reassuring data that the benefits of MHT outweigh the risks for most young menopausal women (within 10 years of menopause or under age 60 years). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Younger, postmenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p>There are conflicting data on the health impact of the decline in MHT use. WHI investigators used mathematical models to estimate the health and economic return of the trial (based upon the initial cost of the trial [USD $260 million], changes in rates of combined estrogen-progestin therapy use over 10 years (2003 to 2012), disease and mortality rates, and the costs assuming a WHI or non-WHI scenario) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. With the WHI scenario, they estimated 4.3 million fewer users of combined HT; 126,000 fewer cases of breast cancer; 76,000 fewer cases of cardiovascular disease; 263,000 more fractures; and savings of USD $35.2 billion dollars. These results suggest that the WHI resulted in beneficial health outcomes and a substantial return on investment. However, the impact of declining use of unopposed estrogen in hysterectomized women was not considered in their analysis, and the analysis was not stratified by age.</p><p>In a second analysis of the impact of avoiding unopposed estrogen therapy post-WHI (women posthysterectomy), an important increase in mortality rates in women ages 50 to 59 years was calculated (a minimum of 18,601 and as many as 91,601 additional deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The broad range of mortality estimates was due to variable estimates of estrogen use and hysterectomy rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H507693\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATES OF RISK IN WOMEN 50 TO 59 YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) demonstrated adverse effects of MHT in older postmenopausal women (over age 60 years or more than 10 years since menopause); this is not the age group that presents with new onset of menopausal symptoms. Almost all women who seek medical therapy for menopausal symptoms do so in their late 40s or 50s. When counseling symptomatic women considering hormone therapy (HT), the clinician should provide the best estimate of potential risks and benefits for five years of use based upon data from women in their 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although most available HT clinical trial data is from women over age 60 years, estimates of the absolute risks and benefits for women starting MHT in their 50s has been published (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks/abstract/2,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,16</a>].

Estrogen-progestin therapy should be used for women with a uterus and unopposed estrogen for those posthysterectomy. For women with vaginal atrophy symptoms only, we suggest vaginal estrogen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal estrogen therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy#H290558928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Choosing candidates'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MHT is effective for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes and vaginal atrophy caused by hypoestrogenism. However, it is currently not recommended for the prevention of chronic disease such as prevention of cardiovascular or bone disease. (See <a href=\"#H91121219\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) combined hormone therapy (HT) trial, risks included CHD events, stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and breast cancer, while benefits included a reduction of fracture and colorectal cancer risk. Results for stroke, VTE, and fracture risk with unopposed conjugated equine estrogen were similar to those in the combined therapy trial. (See <a href=\"#H91121219\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, no increase in either CHD or breast cancer risk was seen with unopposed estrogen use; in fact, a possible reduction in breast cancer risk was observed. The discrepancies in CHD and breast cancer risk between the WHI unopposed-estrogen trial and the combined estrogen-progestin trial suggest that the progestin played an important role in the increased CHD and breast cancer risk seen with combined therapy. (See <a href=\"#H91121219\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent analyses suggest that the risk of CHD appears to depend upon the <strong>timing of exposure</strong>, with no excess risk observed in younger (&lt;60 years of age) menopausal women. In addition, mortality rates appear to be lower in young postmenopausal hormone users compared with nonusers. Thus, for young, symptomatic postmenopausal women, short-term HT is considered to be a reasonable option (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 1</a>).
