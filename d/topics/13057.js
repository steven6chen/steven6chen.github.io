In an attempt to treat patients with severe and life-threatening illnesses (eg, malignancies treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation), immune cells may be transplanted from a non-identical donor to the patient. These donor (eg, graft) cells may recognize patient (eg, host) cells as foreign, thereby initiating a graft-versus-host reaction which may lead to GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An understanding of the pathogenesis of this reaction has been obtained via the study of animal models of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The basic requirements for the development of this disorder were recognized as early as the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These include the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The graft must contain immunologically competent cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The host must possess transplantation antigens that are lacking in the graft, thereby appearing foreign to the graft; host cells subsequently stimulate donor cells via these specific antigenic determinants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The host must be incapable of mounting a reaction against the graft for a period of time sufficient to allow graft cells to attack the host.</p><p/><p>Since GVHD is primarily a T cell mediated disease, this discussion of disease pathogenesis provides an overview of the more important properties and interactions of a transplanted T cell. Other cell types that contribute to the development of GVHD (eg, antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells, B lymphocytes) are discussed more briefly.</p><p>The pathogenesis of GVHD will be reviewed here. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of GVHD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY CLASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to discussing those aspects of T cell function relevant to the pathogenesis of GVHD, it is helpful to first briefly review the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) or HLA (for Human Leukocyte Antigens) in humans since these molecules underlie the recognition of antigen by T cells. The MHC is highly polymorphic from individual to individual, and segregates in families in a Mendelian codominant fashion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genes of the HLA locus encode two distinct classes of cell surface molecules, classes I and II. Class I molecules are expressed on the surfaces of virtually all nucleated cells at varying densities, while class II molecules are more restricted to cells of the immune system, primarily B lymphocytes and monocytes. However, cytokines secreted by lymphocytes and monocytes during immune activation may cause dramatic increases in class II HLA antigen expression, even on cell types which normally have little or no surface expression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are three different class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (HLA-DQ, -DR, -DP) antigens. HLA-A, -B and -DR antigens appear to be the most important loci determining whether transplanted cells initiate a graft versus host reaction (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Since the principal task of the immune system is to distinguish self from non-self, HLA molecules provide the crucial surface upon which the antigen receptors on T lymphocytes (T cell receptors or TCR) recognize foreign (non-self) antigens. On antigen presenting cells such as macrophages, class II molecules present antigenic fragments (in the form of linear peptides) to the CD4 positive inducer (or helper) T cells, while class I molecules function at the effector phase of immunity by presenting antigens to CD8 positive T cells, which generally have <span class=\"nowrap\">cytotoxic/suppressor</span> function. This process of antigen presentation consists of the binding of a single T cell receptor to a complex on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, consisting of the MHC molecule and a peptide fragment derived from the foreign antigen.</p><p>In hematopoietic cell transplantation, the principal antigenic targets of the T cells of the graft are the host MHC molecules if the patient and donor MHC molecules differ. However, for grafts matched at the MHC, mismatching of other antigens, termed minor histocompatibility antigens, appear to underlie the development of GVHD (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation, the following principal factors determine whether graft versus host disease occurs and the strength of the reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types and properties of the transplanted T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histocompatibility antigen mismatching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trafficking of T cells to involved tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interactions between T cells and endothelial cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signaling events occurring between immune cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dose of B lineage-specific progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p>In addition, one study has suggested that the presence of certain HLA alleles, even if fully matched, may be associated with a stronger (ie, HLA -A10, HLA-B7) or weaker (HLA-B27) GVHD response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Initial observations have suggested that the risk of developing GVHD may be less in certain island populations (eg, Japan), due to limited overall genetic diversity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate Immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even before T cells are activated, the innate immune system is an important component of the induction of GVHD. Much of the model for cytokine-driven effects is likely due to stimulation of innate immunity through the preparatory regimen and the gut mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Experimental models and clinical experience point to the importance of gastrointestinal damage and the intestinal microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The conditioning regimen damages the intestinal epithelium and leads to bacterial translocation or enhanced stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) which results in an increased cytokine release by <span class=\"nowrap\">macrophages/monocytes</span> and T-cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TLRs are a large family of proteins involved in pathogen recognition through unique patterns such as nucleic acids or sugars. Clinically, gastrointestinal GVHD is one of the most severe manifestations of acute GVHD and frequently precedes progression to liver GVHD.</p><p>The earliest example of the importance of TLRs is the data on the importance of the <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD2/CARD15</span> protein in Crohn's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD2/CARD15</span> is an intracellular sensor of muramyl dipeptide (a component of the bacterial cell wall) and mediates nuclear factor kappa B activation. <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD2/CARD15</span> expression is found in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and cells of <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> lineage. Within the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD2/CARD15</span> gene, high-risk alleles in SNPs 8, 12, and 13 have been identified which confer an increased risk for Crohn disease. Patients heterozygous for these mutated forms have a two- to fourfold increased risk to develop Crohn disease; the risk increases to 20- to 40-fold in homozygous patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Genetic susceptibility'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the homologies in the pathophysiology of GVHD and inflammatory bowel disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD2/CARD15</span> polymorphisms also have an impact on the pathophysiology of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This was shown in a study of retrospectively-typed DNA from <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pairs in 169 consecutive patients receiving transplants from related or unrelated donors. Mutated alleles were observed in 21 percent of patients and in 14 percent of donors. The cumulative incidence of one-year transplant-related mortality rose from 20 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pairs without mutated SNPs to 49 percent in pairs with recipient mutations and 59 percent in pairs with donor mutations, and was highest in 12 pairs with mutated alleles in both donor and recipients (83 percent).</p><p>Similar associations were observed for severe overall and severe gastrointestinal GVHD. These data suggest that differences in TLRs may be an independent risk factor for complications and clearly demonstrate an important role of the innate immunity in GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, others have not found this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is unclear if these differences are due to patient populations, preparatory regimens, other factors, or a lack of statistical power to observe differences.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that the diversity and composition of intestinal bacteria (ie, gastrointestinal microbiome) play a role in the development of GVHD involving the lower gastrointestinal tract. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease#H3486904\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell heterogeneity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The particular phenotypic T cell variants transplanted from the graft, and their state of activation or level of maturity are important factors underlying GVHD. The population of T cells harvested from bone marrow or peripheral blood is heterogeneous, with most T cells expressing CD3 and T cell receptors. Within this population, both CD4 and CD8 positive cells are found, as well as T cells negative for both CD4 and CD8 (double negatives). These last cells suppress and dampen the immune response (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Besides these phenotypic differences, T cells also exist in various states of activation or maturity. Altered T cell states can be detected via the varied expression of the different isoforms of the antigen CD45, although these changes are not exclusive in that these isoforms may revert back (ie, CD45RO memory cells may revert back to be CD45RA+) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RO positive cells are usually mature memory T cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RA positive cells are usually naive and nonactivated</p><p/><p>The elimination of activated mature T cells, via the use of specific monoclonal antibodies or of different harvesting techniques, may dampen the immune response:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The depletion of CD45RO and CD45RB cells significantly decreases the intensity of mixed lymphocyte reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of memory cells alone prevented GVHD in two murine models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p>Data also exist suggesting that there may be functionally different T cells which arise or differentiate at distinct sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A prevailing hypothesis concerning T cell differentiation is that a naive T cell is solely educated in the thymus of the host, the location where it acquires its life-long immune repertoire. In the thymus, cells which are highly reactive to self-antigens are deleted, and cells which are weakly reactive or non-reactive also die if they fail to receive the proper stimulatory signals by the thymic epithelium.</p><p>However, there may be other anatomic areas where T cells may arise and be endowed with different immune functions. The bone marrow, for example, appears to be an area where T cells mature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. These cells lack certain phenotypic markers and functionally behave as suppressor cells. Another possibility is how T cells traffic to lymphoid organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For example, T cells that home to the Peyer's patches in the gastrointestinal tract may be particularly important in the generation of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Histocompatibility antigen mismatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned previously, CD4 positive cells interact with the MHC class II molecules of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and CD8 positive cells interact with MHC class I antigens. In most centers, a complete match at the HLA-A, -B (both class I) and -DR loci (class II) is required for that individual to be used as a transplant donor, since mismatches at these loci are associated with a higher risk of severe GVHD and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, in some cases, donors and recipients are mismatched at a single HLA locus. The outcome for these patients with a single antigen mismatch is similar to a fully matched donor-recipient pair.</p><p>When related donors are serologically matched at class I loci, the match is likely to be genotypic (ie, genetically identical), whereas unrelated donors with the same serotype may have different alleles, leading to potential clinical incompatibility. This was illustrated in a study of transplant-related mortality (TRM, primarily due to acute GVHD) in 100 unrelated donor-recipient pairs, in which amino acid substitutions of the HLA class I heavy chain were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In multivariate analysis, the only variable predictive of severe acute GVHD was substitution at position 116 of the class I heavy chain. Substitutions at other sites did not affect TRM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Extended haplotype matching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of a matched sibling <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pair, the entire chromosome and its accompanying Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is matched, since identical ones are inherited from the mother and the father. However, in the case of an HLA-matched unrelated donor, it is not known whether other genes in the MHC area are matched as well.</p><p>The genome in the MHC area is organized into blocks of genes that are closely linked (ie, haplotypes) so that matching is based mainly on only three of these genes, HLA-A, B and DRB1. However, the 7.6 million base pairs within the MHC region contain more than 400 genes that have immune-related functions. The total number of transplantation antigens encoded in this region is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The current method used for HLA haplotype matching interrogates only about 18,000 base pairs and therefore cannot define these extended HLA haplotypes. A novel DNA microarray method to isolate DNA strands extending across 2 million base pairs of the MHC has been devised for the purpose of identifying genes that influence transplantation outcomes when the extended haplotypes of the donor and recipient cannot be defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Two hundred forty-six HCT recipients and their donors who had been HLA matched by current techniques were restudied using this novel approach. The authors found that 22 percent of the donor-recipient pairs were in fact haplotype mismatched. Regression analysis, which included disease risk, age, year of transplantation, patient and donor gender, and presence of mismatching at HLA-DPB1, demonstrated that mismatching at the haplotype level was associated with a fourfold greater risk of grade III-IV acute GVHD. A lower risk of disease recurrence due to a greater chance of a graft-versus-leukemia effect was also seen, such that overall survival remained the same.</p><p>These data suggest that this novel method of haplotype matching could be useful in selecting the &quot;best&quot; donor when several are available. This approach could also be used for discovery of genes that predispose patients to autoimmune phenomena, cancer, or infections in cases where susceptibility to these diseases has been strongly linked to specific HLA alleles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">High and low risk antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thus far, no consistent relationship has been shown between any one particular HLA antigen and the risk for development of GVHD. Preliminary studies may shed some light on this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 167 patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing a first HLA-matched allogeneic HCT, the incidence of acute GVHD of grades II to IV was significantly lower in subjects carrying the DR15 allele than in those with other HLA DRB1 alleles (23 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The presence or absence of the DR15 allele did not affect the incidence of chronic GVHD, overall survival, or progression-free survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese study involving 5210 donor-recipient pairs, 15 significant high-risk HLA allele mismatch combinations and one HLA-DRB1-DQB1-linked mismatch combination for severe acute GVHD were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Six specific amino acid substitution positions in HLA class I were identified as those responsible for acute GVHD. Whether these observations pertain to non-Asian populations is not clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 161 HCT recipients matched at the allelic level for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1, mismatching at the HLA-DPB1 locus was associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD and treatment- related mortality and worse overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Mismatching at distinct amino acid positions, especially position 69 of the DPB chain, was of particular negative impact in this study.

Mismatching of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with acute GVHD (&gt; grade II), and mismatching at HA-1, 2, 4, 5 was also significantly associated with GVHD. Acute GVHD developed in <strong>all cases</strong> where a HA-1 positive patient received a HA-1 negative graft. Mismatching at HA-3 was equally distributed between those with and without GVHD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second study, mismatching at the HA-1 locus in HLA-A*0201 individuals was associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD (relative risk 2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>Because the manner in which a particular protein is processed is dependent upon genes outside of the MHC, two siblings, despite having identical MHC molecules, will have many different peptides in the MHC groove [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The identification of the particular peptides responsible for GVHD has been an area of intense research. One such antigen, the HA-2 peptide mentioned above, has been found to be a member of the class I myosin family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Two other miH candidates associated with acute GVHD may be one of the human platelet antigens (HPA), especially HPA-3, and an amino acid polymorphism of CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>It remains unclear how many such peptides behave as miH antigens. Although up to 50 such antigens are estimated to exist in mice, the precise number in humans is unclear. Many potential miH antigens exist in humans, but the actual number that may cause GVHD is probably limited.</p><p>Minor differences in these peptide sequences as compared with the native peptide (such as substitution of one amino acid) can also have profound consequences on the outcome of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions, possibly resulting in partial activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. TCR interactions therefore do not simply activate or disable a T cell; rather, in response to subtle variations of peptide sequences, this engagement may cause a multitude of responses, ranging from profoundly helpful to deleterious. As an example, small changes in peptides may shift a vigorous proliferative response to the induction of an anergic state (or vice versa). These changes have been referred to as altered peptide ligands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a mature donor T cell is placed into the host, the systemic vasculature (including the capillary beds) is the first potential extensive area of contact with new host antigens.

If the receptor recognizes an antigen while the T cell is rolling, the binding of adhesion molecules on the T cell to their endothelial cell ligand is significantly strengthened; this step firmly anchors the T cell, preventing further rolling and initiating conditions necessary for its activation.</p><p>These adhesion molecules, named integrins and selectins, are therefore critically important for initial tethering and subsequent activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This adhesion also permits T cells to eventually move from the circulation into lymph nodes, spleen, other reticuloendothelial organs, and target organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Interference with adhesion therefore weakens the interaction between the TCR and the MHC, leading to a lower binding affinity and perhaps a weaker immune response. The administration of monoclonal antibodies to adhesion molecules may also physically prevent the dimerization of the TCR and MHC molecules (a process important for the proper signaling events); in addition, this event may be altered by the administration of a polymer which binds to the MHC molecule or a peptide modeled after the D1-CD4 domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/44,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8474935\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemokines and chemokine receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemoattractant cytokines, commonly referred to as chemokines, attract leukocytes to sites of tissue injury, infection, or allotransplantation and are essential for the induction of the acute inflammatory response. Initial studies suggest that some chemokines promote the development of GVHD by attracting donor T cells to potential sites of involvement.

The local production of chemokines also results in a chemoattractant gradient, thereby directing leukocyte trafficking through the tissues, blood, and lymph nodes. This process brings naive lymphocytes into contact with antigen, and so enhances the effecter and memory functions of the immune response.

The last condition is a long-lasting state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness. Signaling through the TCR complex in the absence of costimulation is a down-regulatory signal for human T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several ligands have been characterized as candidate molecules for potent costimulation of resting T cells, antigen-primed T-lymphocytes, or T-helper cell clones. The best-characterized are the B7 antigens (B7-1 [CD80] and B7-2 [CD86]); these antigens bind to two T cell surface receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4, resulting in potent costimulation of T cell activation initiated through the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3/T</span> cell receptor complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In normal animals, the outcome of T cell activation is dependent upon signals from the TCR, a costimulatory signal from CD28, and an inhibitory signal from CTLA-4. These characteristics have been elegantly demonstrated in knockout mice with the loss of either CD28 or CTLA-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. The absence of the CD28 signal results in a decrease in T cell responses; by comparison, genetic deletion of CTLA-4 causes a loss of the inhibitory signal, resulting in enhanced and uncontrolled cytokine production and lymphocytic proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Costimulatory requirements for T cells differ depending upon their state of activation-induced maturation. For resting (unprimed) CD4 positive T cells, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (both adhesion molecules) and possibly others provide the co-stimulatory signal(s). As a result, T cell activation in vivo is complex, depending upon the state of activation of the T cell (resting versus activated, naive versus mature), and on the nature of the antigen-presenting cell (professional versus non-professional APCs and resting versus activated B cells).</p><p>Interactions between CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) have also been found to be important in costimulatory signals for T cell activation. The interaction between the CD40 molecule on endothelium and the CD40L on the T cell induces endothelial cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/66,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,71,72</a>]. This activation may lead to increased endothelium expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1. The CD40-CD40L interaction is therefore a mechanism in which activated CD4 positive T cells may increase the immune response by upregulating the expression of endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a T cell is activated and begins to proliferate, it releases a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Cytokines may be very important in various steps of the graft-versus-host reaction. These include the initial stimulation of T cells, the maintenance of stimulation, the afferent phase, and the efferent phase, a period when toxicity is manifest.</p><p>Most cytokine studies have used murine models, either across major or minor histocompatibility barriers. When a MHC mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation is performed in a mouse, both CD4 positive and CD8 positive cells release cytokines such as IL-1, IL-3, IL-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>], GM-CSF, TNF-alpha and gamma-interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease#H6225514\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Further investigation of B cell reconstitution following hematopoietic cell transplantation has revealed that chronic GVHD is associated with increased levels of B cell activation factor (BAFF), delayed recovery of na&iuml;ve memory B cells, and increased numbers of activated memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/142-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">142-145</a>]. Stimulation of these B cells provides a hypothetical mechanism for the generation of autoantibodies that may play a role in the development of GVHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25784855\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non-identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes disease in the transplant recipient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of GVHD is a complex, multistep process. While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated from animal models, many remain unknown. It is clear that the following three factors are necessary for the development of GVHD:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The graft must contain immunologically competent cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The host must possess transplantation antigens that are lacking in the graft, thereby appearing foreign to the graft; host cells subsequently stimulate donor cells via these specific antigenic determinants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The host must be incapable of mounting a reaction against the graft for a period of time sufficient to allow graft cells to attack the host.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GVHD is primarily a T cell mediated disease. In hematopoietic cell transplantation, the principal antigenic targets of the T cells of the graft are the host Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules if the patient and donor MHC molecules differ. However, for grafts matched at the MHC, mismatching of other antigens, termed minor histocompatibility antigens, appear to underlie the development of GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Histocompatibility antigen mismatch'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage of the gastrointestinal system by the conditioning regimen appears to play a role in the initial development of GVHD. The damage is thought to allow bacterial translocation or the enhanced stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), which results in an increased cytokine release by <span class=\"nowrap\">macrophages/monocytes</span> and T-cell activation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Innate Immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating transplanted T cells are activated through interaction with the vascular endothelium, TCR-peptide-MHC interactions, and through a second or costimulatory signal delivered by antigen-presenting cells. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Adhesion and activation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Signaling events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a circulating transplanted T cell is activated and begins to proliferate, it releases a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) which is a potent proinflammatory and immunoregulatory mediator known to play a role in many rheumatologic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cytokines'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating activated transplanted T cells damage the host cells through perforin-dependent cytolysis and Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, regulatory cells appear to be important in controlling the ultimate response of GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cell mediated cytotoxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Regulatory T cells'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ferrara JL, Levine JE, Reddy P, Holler E.
