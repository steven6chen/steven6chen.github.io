Anxiety disorders that may begin in childhood include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder (collectively known as the &ldquo;child anxiety triad&rdquo;), in addition to selective mutism, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobia. </p><p>Pediatric anxiety disorders are associated with functional difficulty in childhood and tend to persist into adulthood, where they are associated with functional impairment and co-occurring psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The development and testing of psychotherapies for pediatric anxiety disorders has largely been limited to cognitive-behavioral therapy and more recent advances in parent-child therapy in very young children. </p><p>This topic describes psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are described separately. Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents is also described separately. Psychosocial treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in children is also discussed separately.

The content of CBT programs can vary but typically includes psychoeducation and exposure to anxiety producing stimuli and situations, couched within an active and collaborative patient-therapist relationship, and reinforced by the use of patient-centered homework assignments. </p><p>Exposure treatment is central to all efficacious CBT for pediatric anxiety disorders; this involves the child gradually but repeatedly experiencing the feared situation with the intent of reducing the associated anxiety, or learning to tolerate and manage normal, expected levels of anxiety. </p><p>There are multiple semi-structured, manualized CBT programs for pediatric anxiety disorders that have been found to be efficacious when delivered by a trained clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>The most well-researched and prominently used program for treating anxiety is the Coping Cat program, which<em> </em>was developed for children ages 7 to 13 diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The C.A.T. Project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]<em> </em>adapts this program for use with adolescents ages 14 to 17 with the same disorders. Both programs help teach youth the following core skills:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychoeducation to the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> and caretakers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic management skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive restructuring techniques</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problem-solving skills</p><p/><p>Once these skills are taught, treatment focuses on gradual exposure to feared situations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10660690\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT is indicated for all of the childhood anxiety disorders, including separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia in adolescents and children age seven and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. </p><p>Children younger than seven typically do not possess the developmental abilities needed to understand and apply cognitive-behavioral strategies to their symptoms, but CBT has been adapted for delivery to parents of children with anxiety disorders, or to parents and children together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3730247321\" class=\"local\">'Adaptations for young children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153468297\"><span class=\"h2\">Conceptualization and components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT conceptualizes anxiety as a tripartite construct that involves interaction between physiological, cognitive, and behavioral components. Change in one of these three components sets up a process of change in one or more of the other two. CBT includes several key treatment components, such as psychoeducation, somatic management skills, cognitive restructuring, exposure to feared situations, and relapse prevention. Each component targets mechanisms that are believed to maintain maladaptive anxiety. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718145\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychoeducation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychoeducation involves teaching children and caregivers about their anxiety symptoms and providing an overview and rationale for CBT. Emphasis is placed on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalizing anxiety symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between anxiety and avoidance; the role of avoidance in maintaining anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The process of exposure treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creating a detailed list of situations the patient avoids due to anxiety and behaviors the child or caregivers enact to reduce anxiety (eg, providing reassurance).</p><p/><p>Patients learn, for example, that the experience and sensations of anxiety are normal, but that maladaptive levels of anxiety interfere with their functioning (eg, leading to poor grades at school, few friendships, or poor work performance). Through self-monitoring of their daily lives and reactions, patients learn to recognize their individual patterns of responding to anxiety-provoking events and triggers with avoidance, increased negative thinking, and greater subjective feelings of distress. </p><p>Self-monitoring may be in the form of paper-and-pencil diary forms or through commercially available software applications (eg, MindShift) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718159\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatic management skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic management skills, including diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, are intended to teach the patient to identify and effectively manage physical symptoms of anxiety. </p><p>Diaphragmatic breathing involves breathing slowly and deeply from the diaphragm, and is intended to facilitate a parasympathetic response. Progressive muscle relaxation involves systematically tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body to relieve muscle tension associated with anxiety. Patients are encouraged to use these strategies when facing anxiety-provoking situations. </p><p>Software applications such as MindShift and various computer-based programs, such as Camp Cope-A-Lot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], reinforce the teaching of these skills to children and teens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718169\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive restructuring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive restructuring is a process of logically identifying and challenging maladaptive thoughts (eg, cognitive distortions) that may be contributing to or perpetuating anxiety. Common cognitive distortions, often labeled as &ldquo;thinking traps,&rdquo; are reviewed with patients and may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fortune telling &ndash; Predicting that negative events will occur in the future</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mind reading &ndash; Assuming that others are thinking negatively about you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catastrophizing &ndash; Believing that a terrible event is likely to occur</p><p/><p>Cognitions serve the same function across the anxiety disorders, to increase anxiety while prompting the child to avoid a situation or to act out with much distress. The focus of the thought varies according to the nature of the anxiety (social fears, general worries, separation concerns, fear of body sensations in panic), yet the process of restructuring these thoughts are the same across the disorders. </p><p>Patients are taught to identify these distortions and challenge them with alternative, coping-focused thoughts, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;What is the worst thing that can happen, and can I handle that?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;What are the chances my fear will come true?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;I have handled this situation before and I can do it again.&rdquo; </p><p/><p>These strategies can be modified for each specific anxiety disorder and to match the age and developmental level of the child. As an example, a therapist may help a child with social anxiety disorder identify his thought, that no one will talk to him at an upcoming party, as &ldquo;fortune telling&rdquo; and help him identify a more adaptive alternate thought, such as, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m invited, someone wants me there, and I might end up with a new friend.&rdquo; </p><p>A child with separation anxiety typically thinks the parent will not make it home from an evening out due to a catastrophe. The child is taught to address his or her inner thoughts with realistic challenges, &ldquo;How many times has Mom gone out at night and not come home? She&rsquo;s always returned! I can go to sleep and she&rsquo;ll be happy to see me at breakfast!&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718179\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to feared situations identified by the patient is considered to be a core component of effective CBT for pediatric anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Exposure directly targets the mechanism of avoidance, which allows symptoms of anxiety to perpetuate and often worsen. Through exposure, patients are guided in repetitions of facing anxiety-provoking situations, which typically causes the anxiety to diminish and in some cases remit. As an example, initial exposure treatment for a child with a specific phobia of dogs might begin with looking at pictures of dogs. Exposure proceeds to being physically near a dog, and then to petting a dog. Of note, exposure treatment of specific phobias is effective in one session, usually two to three hours in length.</p><p>For some youth and situations, the goal of exposure would be learning to tolerate the associated anxiety as opposed to the goal of extinguishing it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This would be for situations where anxiety is typical and normal in magnitude(eg, when the child gives an oral report in class or asks someone on a date). </p><p>Patients typically complete exposures in session with the therapist, and are then encouraged to complete exposures regularly between treatment sessions. The process of exposure is very similar across pediatric anxiety disorders, with only the content of exposures changing based on the child&rsquo;s fears. </p><p>For younger children, it is typically helpful to involve caregivers during in-session exposures so that they can lead their children in exposures at home. Older children and adolescents are often more able to complete exposures independently and may not want their caregivers&rsquo; involvement. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718189\"><span class=\"h3\">Relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapse prevention helps to sustain the effects of treatment by working with the patient to establish a contingency plan in the event that symptoms or functioning worsen after termination. The return of symptoms can be due to a setback, to external events (such as a return to school), or to taking on new, challenging developmental tasks. Further treatment might involve additional &ldquo;booster sessions&rdquo; of CBT, check-in calls, or other types of intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718888\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of individual CBT to treat separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder in children as young as seven years. CBT for panic disorder has empirical support in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. Single, small trials suggest that CBT may be efficacious for selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder. There are no randomized trials of CBT for agoraphobia in <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adolescents</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153468336\"><span class=\"h3\">Social anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have found CBT to be efficacious for pediatric social anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 50 youths (ages 7 to 14) to 12 weeks of child-focused CBT, CBT plus parent involvement, or to a waitlist condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At the end of the treatment period, patients assigned to each of the CBT groups experienced higher remission rates compared with the control group (58 and 87.5 versus 7 percent). At 12-month follow-up, treatment gains were maintained for both CBT groups. A statistically insignificant trend found greater efficacy for the combination of CBT plus parent involvement compared with CBT alone (81 versus 53 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153468360\"><span class=\"h3\">Selective mutism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small trials suggest that exposure therapy may be more effective than contingency management for pediatric anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. As an example, a 2013 trial randomly assigned 21 children ages four to eight years with selective mutism to 24 weeks of integrated behavior therapy for selective mutism or a 12-week waitlist control. The exposure-based therapy group increased speaking behavior among the group by 75 percent compared with the control condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4062655089\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have found a one-session CBT treatment in children diagnosed with specific phobia reduced phobic and anxious symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This treatment comprises primarily of continued graded exposure to the feared object over the course of several hours. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3046475061\"><span class=\"h3\">Panic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have found cognitive behavioral therapies to be efficacious in panic disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] randomly assigned 26 adolescents ages 14 to 17 and diagnosed with panic disorder to receive 11 weeks of panic control treatment for adolescents (PCT-A), which is a downward extension of panic control treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or to a control condition involving self-monitoring panic symptoms and meeting with a therapist every two weeks to review monitoring. At post-treatment, the PCT-A group was found to have a greater reduction of panic symptoms compared with the control condition. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 trial randomly assigned 54 youth ages 11 to 17 to intensive CBT or to a waitlist condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Panic disorder diagnosis, severity, and number of feared or avoided situations were assessed at baseline and after six weeks. Results showed intensive CBT was more efficacious at reducing both symptoms and criteria for diagnosis compared with the control condition. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036713283\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple anxiety disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical trials found CBT to be effective in children and adolescents with multiple anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,18,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,32-36</a>]. As an example, a 16-week trial randomly assigned 47 participants ages 9 to 13 with either separation anxiety disorder, DSM-III avoidant disorder, or DSM-III overanxious disorder to receive CBT or to a waitlist control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Based on serial assessments with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children and Parents, participants assigned to the CBT group were much more likely to meet criteria for remittance rate of the anxiety disorder at the completion of treatment compared with the control group (64 versus 5 percent). Symptom improvement gains were also maintained by participants receiving CBT compared with waitlist controls at follow-up after one year. Several subsequent studies have also found CBT superior to waitlist or active control conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,33-36</a>].</p><p>A modular approach to treatment of childhood anxiety disorders may be superior to standard treatment protocols. In this approach, the clinician is instructed to apply specific treatment modules, such as cognitive restructuring, exposure, or parenting strategies, based on child and parent feedback and clinician judgment. When children present with multiple problems requiring more than one treatment, the modular approach provides guidance with sequencing treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A modular approach may be particularly helpful for children exhibiting anxiety disorders and comorbid depression or disruptive behavior disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525468773\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderators of treatment outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain factors have been found to moderate treatment outcome in CBT for childhood anxiety disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family-based treatment may be superior for younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and when both parents also had an anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low anxiety sensitivity and high caregiver burden were predictors of poorer response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children diagnosed with social anxiety disorder responded more poorly to CBT compared with children with generalized anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10658613\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child and adolescent patients in these clinical trials typically received CBT over 12 to 20 weekly sessions of 45- to 60-minute sessions.

(See <a href=\"#H10659346\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10659582\" class=\"local\">'Other psychotherapies'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on the interplay between cognitions, behaviors and emotions, helping patients to recognize and modify maladaptive anxiety-provoking thoughts and to change patterns of avoidance. The content of CBT programs can vary but typically includes psychoeducation and exposure to anxiety producing stimuli and situations, couched within an active and collaborative patient-therapist relationship, and reinforced by the use of patient-centered homework assignments. (See <a href=\"#H10659346\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure treatment is central to all efficacious CBT for pediatric anxiety disorders; this involves the child gradually but repeatedly experiencing the feared situation with the intent of reducing the associated anxiety, or learning to tolerate and manage normal, expected levels of anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H10659346\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of individual CBT to treat separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder in children as young as seven years. CBT for panic disorder has empirical support in adolescence. Smaller trials suggest that CBT may be efficacious for selective mutism, separation anxiety disorder and comorbid anxiety and depression. (See <a href=\"#H718888\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A growing body of research suggests that clinical interventions with parents or parent and child may be efficacious for treating anxiety disorders in children and for children with separation disorder, both between age four and seven. These treatments are primarily adaptions of CBT strategies applied to older children and adolescents, but with greater parental involvement. (See <a href=\"#H3730247321\" class=\"local\">'Adaptations for young children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest CBT as a first-line treatment of children with an anxiety disorder of mild to moderate severity rather than an SSRI or other treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
