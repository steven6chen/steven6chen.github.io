HLHS is the most common form of functional single ventricle heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database reported an estimate of 16,781 cases of HLHS among neonates born between 1988 and 2005 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A male predominance (male to female ratio approximately 1.5:1) is observed in most population-based and clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The reported overall incidence is likely underestimated because of the indeterminate rate of spontaneous abortions and elective termination of pregnancy of affected fetuses.</p><p>Despite its low incidence relative to other congenital cardiac disorders, HLHS, if left untreated, is responsible for 25 to 40 percent of all neonatal cardiac deaths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18895183\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project anatomically defines HLHS as &quot;a spectrum of cardiac malformations with normally related great arteries characterized by underdevelopment of the left heart with significant hypoplasia of the left ventricle including atresia, stenosis or hypoplasia of the aortic or mitral valve, or both valves, and hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and arch&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In clinical settings, the anatomic variants of the disease are often distinguished by the status of the left heart valves (eg, mitral stenosis with aortic atresia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82280 \">figure 1</a>). At one extreme of this anatomic spectrum, atresia of both the mitral and aortic valves is associated with either an absent or a slit-like left ventricular (LV) cavity and diminutive ascending aorta. With no possibility of LV output, this anatomic subtype is unequivocally identified as HLHS. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the &quot;borderline left heart&quot; in which left heart valves are patent and near-normal in size, but LV hypoplasia and serial left heart obstructions result in the dependence on a postnatal patent ductus arteriosus to maintain adequate systemic circulation. At this end of the spectrum, the need for a Norwood stage I type intervention becomes the defining feature of a diagnosis of HLHS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635302\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying causal mechanism of HLHS is unknown. The main contributing mechanisms are thought to be alterations in blood flow and genetic contributions. Other mechanisms that have been suggested include intrauterine infarction, infection, and selective left ventricular (LV) cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370353043\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One prevalent theory hypothesizes that &quot;primary&quot; anatomic defects of isolated left heart structures lead to altered blood flow through the left side of the heart, resulting in secondary malformation of the LV and outflow tract pathway (sometimes called the &quot;no flow, no grow&quot; theory). The flow-based theory is supported by observational studies of human fetuses which reveal that aortic valve stenosis is an isolated early finding among fetuses who develop progressive prenatal hypoplasia of the left heart and neonatal HLHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, animal studies have shown that obstructing flow results in severe structural heart defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18895190\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HLHS most commonly occurs sporadically in otherwise clinically normal neonates. Nonsyndromic HLHS appears to be genetically heterogeneous, and multiple loci have been implicated including <em>NKX2.5</em> on chromosome 5 and loci on 10q22 and 6q23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although the genetic relationship between HLHS and other left heart lesions is poorly understood, the recurrence risk of left heart disease in first degree relatives of infants with this disease is estimated at 2 to 4 percent. This recurrence risk supports the view that predisposing mutations, which are incompletely penetrant, play a role in pathogenesis.</p><p>HLHS has also been associated with the following genetic disorders: Turner syndrome (XO), Jacobsen syndrome (deletion of distal 11q), trisomy 13, and trisomy 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635622\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With hypoplastic or atretic left heart valves, and a diminutive left ventricle, the right ventricle (RV) must perfuse both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Survival is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to ensure adequate systemic perfusion (from the RV to the aorta) and a nonrestrictive atrial septal defect (ASD) to ensure adequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The relative distribution of RV output to the systemic and pulmonary circulations is dependent on the relative resistances of these parallel circuits.</p><p>At birth, there is typically a short &quot;honeymoon&quot; period, when the ductus arteriosus is unrestrictive and pulmonary arteriolar resistance is relatively high. As a result, there is no restriction of adequately oxygenated systemic blood flow from the RV through the PDA and into the aorta. During this period, infants may be relatively asymptomatic. However, two normal physiologic postdelivery events, PDA closure and a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, lead to a decrease in systemic perfusion and an increase in pulmonary blood flow. These events, if unchecked, lead to cardiogenic shock and ventilatory insufficiency.</p><p>In an estimated 10 percent of cases of HLHS, there is an inadequate defect in the atrial septum to allow egress of pulmonary venous return from the left atrium back to the RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Restrictive ASDs result in increased pulmonary venous congestion and inadequate interatrial mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Thus, these patients present after delivery with severe cyanosis and acidosis, and rapidly deteriorate with hemodynamic instability and shock. They require urgent intervention to create a larger atrial communication for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1247847362\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal of initial management of HLHS is to maintain adequate systemic perfusion by preserving the patency of the ductus arteriosus and establishing an adequate atrial defect for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Avoidance of measures that could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood flow (ie, high fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO<sub>2</sub>]) is also essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H250708383\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Initial medical management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942406903\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1247847362\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of HLHS are identified on prenatal ultrasonography and fetal echocardiography.

In some cases, a dusky appearance due to cyanosis is noted in the newborn nursery, but other patients may appear normal and are occasionally discharged home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As the PDA begins to close and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, infants become symptomatic with a decrease in systemic perfusion manifested by diminished peripheral pulses and increasing pulmonary blood flow, which eventually leads to hypotension, acidosis, and respiratory distress. Symptoms can rapidly progress from cyanosis, increased respiratory distress, and poor feeding to heart failure and cardiogenic shock. (See <a href=\"#H635622\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with a restrictive or no ASD at birth present with severe cyanosis and respiratory distress because of inadequate interatrial mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and increasing pulmonary venous congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

Fetuses with HLHS have decreased growth velocity in late pregnancy compared with unaffected fetuses, resulting in small for gestational age presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2457131985\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following clinical features are typically found in the natural course of HLHS, although timing varies depending on the size of the ASD and patency of the ductus arteriosus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyanosis &ndash; Cyanosis is the most common feature of HLHS. The degree of cyanosis is determined by the relative states of pulmonary and systemic blood flow (ie, infants with very high pulmonary flow rates may have very mild degrees of cyanosis). Cyanosis is not corrected by the use of supplemental oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Hyperoxia test'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachypnea &ndash; Rarely, more significant respiratory distress is part of the early presentation and becomes more prominent as pulmonary blood flow increases or acidosis develops.

In both fetal and postnatal examinations, the anatomic features including a diminutive left ventricle (LV), abnormal mitral and aortic valves, and a hypoplastic ascending aorta are readily identified and confirm the diagnosis of HLHS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635588\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is possible during a routine obstetrical ultrasound screening in the second trimester of pregnancy (typically between 18 and 24 weeks gestation), if the clinician recognizes the above constellation of anatomic findings for HLHS. Additional features of the prenatal echocardiogram (ECG) that are associated with left heart hypoplasia or dysfunction include left-to-right flow at the level of the atrial septum (normally right-to-left in utero) and retrograde flow in the transverse arch (due to the ascending aortic and coronary arterial flow being supplied via the ductus arteriosus). Antenatal diagnosis is also made when fetal echocardiography is performed due to family history or other fetal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. HLHS is diagnosed prenatally in approximately 50 to 60 percent of cases at tertiary referral centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>].

However, there does not appear to be any difference in mortality between prenatally and postnatally diagnosed patients, as illustrated by the following case series.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one large case series of 216 neonates with HLHS referred for surgical palliation between 1992 and 1997, all prenatally-diagnosed patients were born at a tertiary facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prostaglandin E1 (also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) treatment was started earlier in neonates diagnosed prenatally compared with postnatally diagnosed patients (day 1 versus day 2 of life). Overall mortality was 26 percent and did not differ between the two groups; however, the risk of perioperative neurologic events was lower in the prenatally diagnosed group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series of 87 neonates cared for at a single tertiary center between 1999 and 2010, prenatally diagnosed cases, all of whom were inborn, had lower gestational age and birth weight than postnatally diagnosed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of the patients undergoing surgery (45 prenatal cases and 28 postnatal cases), there were no differences in survival (91 versus 89 percent), postoperative complications, and length of stay.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635765\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the characteristic echocardiographic findings of HLHS are a diminutive LV, abnormal mitral and aortic valves, and hypoplastic ascending aorta, which confirm the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59781\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59781 \">image 1</a>). These patients have normal segmental anatomy and an intact ventricular septum. The mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic valves may be atretic or if present may be severely stenotic. The ascending aorta is often small and can be extremely diminutive in cases with aortic valvar atresia. Ductal flow is typically bidirectional (right-to-left in systole). As noted above, an atrial septal defect is essential for survival, and flow is left to right.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635787\"><span class=\"h3\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although chest radiography and electrocardiography are often performed in the evaluation of a patient with HLHS, they are nonspecific and are not diagnostically useful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrocardiography</strong> &ndash; Although right axis deviation and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy are common ECG findings in patients with HLHS, they are nonspecific and difficult to distinguish from the typical RV predominance seen in the ECG of normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> &ndash; The chest radiographic findings vary and are nonspecific. In infants with increased pulmonary blood flow, typical findings include cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vasculature.
