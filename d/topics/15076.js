In ROP, extra blood vessels grow inside the eye. They can damage the tissue at the back of the eye, called the &quot;retina.&quot; This part of the eye contains the cells that react to light. Damage to the retina can cause vision problems and even blindness.</p><p>ROP usually goes away as a baby grows. But if ROP is severe, a baby might need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108791183\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ROP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ROP does not usually cause symptoms. But if a baby is born very early or is very small, doctors will check for signs of ROP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108791198\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ROP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. An eye doctor with special training in caring for newborn babies can do an exam to check for ROP. A baby might not need this exam until he or she is 4 to 8 weeks old.</p><p>After the first exam, an eye doctor will probably check your baby's eyes every 1 to 3 weeks. He or she can check to see if the ROP is getting worse or better. If it gets worse, your baby might need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108791213\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ROP treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some babies do not need any treatment for ROP. But severe ROP needs treatment. If severe ROP is not treated, it can cause blindness.</p><p>Doctors usually treat ROP with a procedure called &quot;photocoagulation.&quot; This treatment uses a powerful light called a &quot;laser&quot; to seal or destroy the extra blood vessels.</p><p>Another treatment involves injecting the eye with special medicines. These medicines stop the extra blood vessels from growing.</p><p>Sometimes, ROP pulls the retina out of its normal place in the eye. When this happens, it is called a &quot;retinal detachment.&quot; Doctors can do surgery to try to put the retina back in place. But there might be too much damage for surgery to fix it completely. If this happens to your baby, he or she might not see well from that eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108791228\"><span class=\"h1\">Can ROP be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right now, doctors do not have a good way to keep babies from getting ROP. Feeding your baby breast milk can help protect him or her from getting ROP. Breast milk has other benefits for babies, too.</p><p>If your baby needs eye exams to check for ROP, make sure you go to all the appointments. If you do this, your baby can get treatment for ROP if he or she needs it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108791243\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
