It is an aggressive NHL where survival without treatment is measured in months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of patients with DLBCL, the majority are not cured with conventional therapy. Following relapse, at least 60 percent of patients remain sensitive to conventional treatment, but less than 10 percent of patients experience prolonged disease-free survival with second-line treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is discussed here; diagnosis, staging, prognostic measures, and the initial treatment of DLBCL are presented separately.

Clinicians must always be alert to their potential presence and be prepared to deal with them urgently and effectively. These issues are discussed separately.

At these visits, patients are evaluated with a history, physical examination, blood work, and, if indicated, imaging studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Surveillance for relapse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459934133\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining relapsed and refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refractory (resistant) DLBCL is suggested by a less than 50 percent decrease in lesion size with treatment in the absence of new lesion development. In contrast, progressive disease usually manifests as the appearance of any new lesion, a 50 percent increase in the longest diameter of a previously identified lesion, or <span class=\"nowrap\">new/recurrent</span> involvement of the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480 \">table 1</a>). Relapsed disease reflects the appearance of any new lesion after attainment of an initial complete remission.</p><p>Refractory or progressive disease is identified during the post-treatment response evaluation. The majority of relapses occur during the first two years after completion of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, as many as 18 percent of relapses occur more than five years after initial treatment. Relapses are usually symptomatic and are rarely identified solely on the basis of routine imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Progressive disease or relapse can present with systemic B symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss), cytopenias, the development of an extranodal mass, or as the symptomatic or asymptomatic enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen.</p><p>When relapse is suspected, a biopsy of the involved lymph node or mass is recommended to confirm relapse and evaluate for a potential change in histology, for example to an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459934229\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsed DLBCL can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy. In patients with prior complete remission who present with new lymph node or organ involvement, the importance of a repeat biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of recurrent lymphoma cannot be overemphasized. While most of these patients will have recurrent lymphoma, other conditions (eg, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, fungal infection, carcinoma) may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infrequently, patients will have a change in histology, resulting in a change in preferred treatment.

The pretreatment evaluation of a patient with relapsed disease is similar to that performed prior to initial therapy.

We suggest that the following tests be performed to assess molecular risk in all patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H14049196\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetics'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An evaluation of MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 status, preferably by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) &ndash; These studies should be performed in the relapsed setting even if they were performed at the time of the initial diagnosis since it is possible to acquire a <em>MYC</em> translocation upon relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An evaluation of cell of origin by gene expression profile (GEP) analysis, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx platform &ndash; Cell of origin testing does not need to be repeated at the time of relapse if it was already performed at initial diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Using this information, an individual case may be subclassified as one of the following, which may have therapeutic implications (see <a href=\"#H935612098\" class=\"local\">'Tailoring the therapy by molecular subtype'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL &ndash; Cases with GCB DLBCL identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx without double hit DLBCL. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated B cell (ABC) DLBCL &ndash; Cases with non-GCB DLBCL identified by GEP, immunohistochemistry algorithms, or Lymph2Cx without double hit DLBCL. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Double hit DLBCL&quot; &ndash; <em>MYC</em> translocation plus gene rearrangement of <em>BCL2</em>,<em> BCL6</em>, or both.

The impact of disease subtype on the prognosis of <strong>relapsed or refractory</strong> disease is not clear and requires further exploration. Of importance, double hit DLBCL occurs more frequently in GCB and is responsible for a large percentage of relapse events in that subgroup. Studies of novel agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) suggest that the efficacy of these agents differs by disease subtype. As such, analysis of disease subtype may help guide the choice of therapy in relapsed disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACHIEVING A SECOND RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsed or refractory DLBCL is treated with systemic chemoimmunotherapy (&quot;salvage&quot; therapy) with plans to proceed to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease. </p><p>For patients who fail to respond adequately to salvage therapy (ie, chemoresistant DLBCL), we suggest participation in a clinical trial; other acceptable options include allogeneic HCT or chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H921146805\" class=\"local\">'Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who are not candidates for HCT or who relapse after HCT, we suggest participation in a clinical trial, CAR-T therapy, or palliative care. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Regimens for patients ineligible for transplant'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of HCT, conventional chemoimmunotherapy regimens provide only transient disease control for the majority of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Patients with primary refractory disease rarely achieve a complete remission when treated with a second chemotherapy regimen. Following relapse from a first complete remission, a subset of patients will achieve a second complete remission with chemotherapy; however, these remissions are generally not durable, and long-term disease-free survivors are rare. In contrast, approximately half of patients who respond to a second chemotherapy regimen and proceed to HCT will maintain their response at two years. (See <a href=\"#H68955546\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>A retrospective pooled analysis (SCHOLAR-1) included 636 patients with refractory DLBCL or who relapsed after autologous HCT from two phase 3 trials and two observational cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Salvage therapy achieved an objective response rate of 26 percent (7 percent complete response), six-month median overall survival (OS), and 20 percent two-year OS. </p><p>Numerous studies have illustrated the importance of demonstrating chemotherapy sensitivity prior to proceeding with HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, a report of 103 patients with refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, most of whom had DLBCL, evaluated the use of high-dose sequential treatment (HST) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> followed by a high-dose regimen and autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of those responding to HST and going on to receive HCT, 53 percent were in continuous complete remission at a median follow-up of two years. In comparison, the two-year OS rate of non-responders going on to receive HCT was less than 10 percent; all non-responders to HST who did not receive HCT died of their disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Regimens for transplant candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of chemotherapy agents and combination regimens have been used as salvage therapy for patients with resistant or relapsed DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-32</a>]. Most of these regimens contain non-cross-resistant drugs at higher doses. No agent or regimen has demonstrated superiority to another in this setting. As such, a choice among regimens is largely based upon side effect profiles and clinical experience. The genetic and molecular subtype may also help to guide selection, as described below. In theory, the preferred regimen would exclude agents at dose levels for salvage that the patient has been exposed to recently and would allow for future stem cell collection.</p><p>The most commonly used regimens are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GDP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>] &ndash; Gemcitabine (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day on days 1 and 8), cisplatin (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on day 1), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg daily on days 1 through 4) are administered at 21-day intervals.

Two randomized trials have compared regimens in this setting: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the CORAL trial, 396 patients with DLBCL in first relapse or with primary refractory disease were randomly assigned treatment with R-ICE or R-DHAP followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT for responding patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity was significantly more common with R-DHAP, especially thrombocytopenia and renal toxicity. At a median follow-up of 27 months, three cycles of R-ICE resulted in similar rates of overall response (64 versus 63 percent), three-year event-free survival (EFS; 26 and 35 percent), and three-year OS (47 and 51 percent) when compared with three cycles of R-DHAP. While outcomes were inferior for the 17 percent of patients whose tumors harbored an <span class=\"nowrap\">8q24/<em>MYC</em></span> rearrangement (eg, four-year OS 29 versus 62 percent), a subset analysis did not demonstrate superiority of either treatment regimen in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In contrast, in a subset analysis of patients with germinal center B cell (GCB) DLBCL (the bioCORAL study), R-DHAP was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS; 100 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the LY.12 trial, 619 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma (71 percent DLBCL) were randomly assigned to GDP or DHAP (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> for patients with B cell lymphoma), followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT for responding patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. When compared with DHAP, GDP resulted in similar response rates (45 versus 44 percent), percent of patients proceeding with HCT (52 versus 49 percent), EFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99), and OS (HR 1.03). DHAP was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization (99 versus 47 percent) and severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> toxicity (61 versus 47 percent) including febrile neutropenia (23 versus 9 percent) and thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions (47 versus 31 percent). There were eight treatment-related deaths, two during treatment with GDP and six after receiving DHAP.</p><p/><p>Any of the regimens listed above would be acceptable second-line chemotherapy, and practice varies by clinical center. A choice between these regimens must take into consideration the experience of the clinician with the administration of these regimens and the molecular subtype (ie, GCB versus ABC cell of origin). Importantly, the toxicity differs among these regimens with DHAP clearly being more toxic than GDP and ICE in the randomized trials described above. (See <a href=\"#H935612098\" class=\"local\">'Tailoring the therapy by molecular subtype'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are candidates for HCT, we suggest the use of R-GDP rather than another regimen. This preference is largely based upon presumed equal efficacy to other regimens, a more acceptable toxicity profile, and our familiarity with this regimen. While R-ICE and R-DHAP are potential alternatives, they are usually administered in the inpatient setting, which comes with additional costs. In addition, R-DHAP is associated with significantly greater toxicity. The decision to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to second-line therapy is largely dependent on the length of initial response but is generally encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H68956458\" class=\"local\">'Should rituximab be added?'</a> below.)</p><p>A chemotherapy regimen is generally administered for two to three cycles. Disease response to therapy is assessed by combined positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scans (or CT alone where PET is not available) three weeks after completion of the second or third chemotherapy cycle. This earlier response assessment (compared with six to eight weeks after initial chemotherapy) allows for responding patients to proceed to transplantation in a timely fashion.

Whether rituximab therapy should be included in the treatment of all patients with relapsed or refractory disease is controversial. This is primarily because the studies that have demonstrated a benefit from rituximab in the setting of relapsed disease have included few patients who received rituximab as part of their initial chemotherapy regimen. Some clinicians choose to include rituximab in the treatment of all patients with relapsed or refractory disease while others reserve the use of rituximab for those patients who relapse late (eg, &gt;6 months) after a complete remission or did not receive rituximab as part of their initial therapy.</p><p>For patients with relapsed DLBCL who did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> with initial therapy (which in the current era is exceedingly rare), we recommend the addition of rituximab to second-line chemotherapy rather than the administration of chemotherapy alone. For most patients with relapsed DLBCL who were initially treated with a rituximab-containing regimen, we also suggest the addition of rituximab to second-line chemotherapy rather than the administration of chemotherapy alone. This preference reflects the low rate of side effects with rituximab and the suggestion of an increased response rate that may allow for progression to potentially curable HCT.
