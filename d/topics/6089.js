TEVAR was initially used to provide treatment to patients who were not considered to be surgical candidates, but it is now the preferred technique for treatment given the improved risk profile compared with open thoracic aortic surgery. In this topic review, we principally discuss endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, but variations on the technique as it pertains to other thoracic pathologies are also briefly reviewed. </p><p>The indications for, preparation, and issues related to thoracic endograft placement, follow-up, and outcomes will be reviewed. Issues related to the management of thoracic aortic diseases that might be treated using thoracic endovascular stent-grafts are discussed separately.

The ascending thoracic aorta gives off the coronary arteries, and the aortic arch branches are typically the brachiocephalic trunk (branches to the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries), left common carotid and left subclavian arteries; however, aortic arch anatomy can vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54048\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048 \">figure 2</a>). The descending thoracic aorta provides paired thoracic arteries (T1-T12) and continues through the hiatus of the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86026%7ESURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86026 graphicRef51087 \">figure 3A-B</a>) to become the abdominal aorta, which extends retroperitoneally to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. </p><p>The abdominal aorta is a retroperitoneal structure that begins at the hiatus of the diaphragm and extends to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 3B</a>). It lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is in close apposition. The branches of the aorta (superior to inferior) include the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries, possible accessory renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, left and right common iliac arteries, middle sacral artery, and the paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4). </p><p>The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 4</a>). The internal iliac artery, also termed the hypogastric artery, gives off anterior and posterior branches to the pelvic viscera and also supplies the musculature of the pelvis. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2546783662\"><span class=\"h2\">Landing zone classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thoracic aorta is divided into landing zones (zones 0 to 4) for the purpose of describing the extent of endovascular coverage, which determines the need for aortic debranching procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107727 \">figure 5</a>).

The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The thoracic spinal cord is particularly dependent on radicular contributions to the anterior spinal artery. The artery of Adamkiewicz (Arteria Radicularis Magna) is the most prominent thoracic radicular artery and can be found between the T9 to T12 level in the majority of individuals, but can also be located above or below this level. The anatomy of the spinal cord is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The pivotal trials of stent-graft placement for the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysm led to its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta has been increasingly used for other aortic pathologies, including blunt thoracic aortic injury, aortic dissection, and penetrating aortic ulcer, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Guidelines from major medical and surgical societies emphasize an individualized approach when choosing endovascular repair, taking into account the patient's age and risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Whether to choose an open or endovascular approach for specific aortic pathologies is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H67146420\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic aortic aneurysm'</a> below and <a href=\"#H67146303\" class=\"local\">'Other thoracic aortic pathologies'</a> below.)</p><p>While there are no randomized trials directly comparing open and endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta, observational studies suggest equivalent or better patient-important outcomes with thoracic endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Benefits of endovascular relative to open repair include avoidance of sternotomy and thoracotomy, no need to cross-clamp the aorta, less blood loss, a lower incidence of end-organ ischemia, fewer episodes of respiratory dependency, and quicker recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67146420\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic aortic aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysms are classified depending upon their proximal and distal extent as ascending aneurysm, arch aneurysm, descending thoracic aneurysm, and thoracoabdominal aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66037\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66037 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/1,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-18</a>].

Survival is improved for open surgical repair compared with medical therapy, and although there are few data comparing endovascular repair and medical management, it is reasonable to assume that outcomes will also be better for endovascular repair in those patients with indications for open surgery, since endovascular repair compares favorably with open surgery.

However, long-term data regarding the longevity of stent repair in this typically younger age group are not available.

Treatment of complicated Type B dissection with malperfusion has been successfully treated using endovascular techniques and consists of covering the primary entry tear and re-expanding the true lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Assessment of the restoration of luminal flow to the true lumen can be performed with the use of IVUS (intravascular ultrasound), which offers real-time information regarding the true and false lumina throughout the cardiac cycle. Although thoracic devices have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of both acute and chronic dissection, there is considerable uncertainty in terms of the role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in the setting of chronic dissection and further study is needed.</p><p>In the multicenter INvestigation of STEnt grafts in patients with type B Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD trial), optimal medical therapy was compared with endovascular stent-graft placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. At one year follow-up, no significant difference in all-cause mortality was found at one year between the groups. At five years, TEVAR in addition to optimal medical treatment was associated with improved aorta-specific survival and delayed disease progression. A critique of the INSTEAD trial was that the study was designed to evaluate patients with more chronic dissections (56 days in the stent-graft group versus 75 days in the medical management group). The ADSORB study, a pending trial in Europe, will compare best medical management to stent-grafting for patients with uncomplicated type B dissection presenting &lt;14 days after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Proponents of designs that have less metallic support structure claim the device is better able to adapt to changes in aneurysm configuration over time. On the other hand, some physicians feel that fully supported endografts are less prone to kinking and subsequent thrombosis. The curve of the proximal thoracic aorta adds an additional challenge to achieving a design with adequate proximal fixation and seal. The amount of radial support, which allows the endograft to withstand external compression must be weighed against the need for enough flexibility and conformability within the device to navigate the proximal aorta and achieve a proper seal following deployment. </p><p>New endograft designs are continually being tested to enhance performance. Improvements have focused upon smaller device and delivery profiles, more accurate deployment, improved fixation systems, and perhaps most importantly, flexibility in managing challenging anatomy. These improvements, along with increased operator experience, have led to improvements in the short-term and long-term results of endovascular aneurysm repair, and have expanded the application of endovascular repair to many patients whose aortic anatomy was previously deemed unsuitable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67143035\"><span class=\"h1\">PLANNING TEVAR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67143042\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, including the femoral arteries, and three-dimensional reformatting to assess the aorta to appropriately size the diameter and length of the thoracic endograft.

We use centerline measurements, which are particularly useful for angled sections of the aorta, to evaluate for device length, but other methods are also used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The angulation of the aorta often progresses with age as atherosclerotic changes lead to lengthening and increased tortuosity, which adds to the difficulty of accurate device deployment and obtaining an adequate proximal seal. In general, a 2-cm length of normal diameter aorta is required to achieve a seal. Specific parameters for individual devices are given in the instructions for use (IFU) for each device. </p><p>Suitable iliac artery morphology is also required for passage of the thoracic endograft. The iliac arteries should have a minimal amount of calcification and tortuosity, and no significant stenosis. Generally, a 7- to 8-mm external iliac artery should accommodate a 22 French sheath, which is an approximately 24 French (8 mm) outer diameter. In one review, women were more likely to require a low-profile device or conduit to allow placement of a device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The requirements for a specific device are found in the IFU.

If the proximal end of the graft is oriented towards the apex of such a curve, &quot;bird-beaking&quot; where the graft is not apposed to the aortic wall will occur, increasing the risk of graft collapse, migration, and failure of aneurysm exclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. With adequate preoperative planning, landing more proximally and debranching the arch as needed can usually circumvent these issues. To achieve the 20-mm proximal seal required and ensure that the graft will sit in close apposition to the inner curve of the arch, debranching procedures using &quot;hybrid&quot; techniques can be performed, which essentially &quot;move&quot; the branch vessels to a more proximal location, allowing coverage of the origins of these vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].

Median survival was 57.6 months (95% CI 55-61 months). Early and late mortality depended upon underlying aortic pathology.

Isolated aneurysm patients, in particular those not requiring subclavian artery coverage, had the lowest incidence of perioperative death, although they had a relatively higher incidence of late death. Aortic rupture was associated with a high incidence of early and late death. A sobering finding of this large analysis was that among patients who survived to 180 days, 6 to 12 percent of patients died per year, depending on aortic diagnosis.
