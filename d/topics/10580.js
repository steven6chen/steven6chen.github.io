This is based on the fact that there is a wide clinical experience with warfarin in these patients and that patients with an eGFR of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> were almost entirely excluded from the randomized trials of the NOAC agents. In addition, unlike patients with normal renal function, patients with stage 4 CKD are at higher risk of having unpredictable sudden deterioration in renal function, which could suddenly result in less clearance of a NOAC that depends on renal metabolism.</p><p>For these patients in whom a decision is made to anticoagulate but who cannot take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (for reasons such as inability to keep the INR in or near the therapeutic range), we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a> with the dosing schedule described below.

In addition, as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is metabolized mainly by the liver, there are no recommendations to alter warfarin dose in patients with CKD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, observations of higher rates of bleeding in patients with ESRD taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, compared with those with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction, have raised the possibility of an influence of CKD on warfarin dosing. The relationship between kidney function and warfarin dose was evaluated in a study of 565 patients stratified by baseline renal function (eGFR &ge;60, 30 to 59, or &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). After adjustment for clinical and genetic factors, patients with severe CKD had significantly lower warfarin dose requirements compared with those with lesser degrees of renal impairment (3.9, 4.3, and 4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, the proportion of INR values in the target range was significantly lower in those with more impaired renal function (46, 46, and 50 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H124798703\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Clinical use of anticoagulants'</a>.)</p><p>Lower eGFRs are associated with poorer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> control (proportion of out-of-range INRs) and a significantly higher rate of major bleeding (RR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8-7.2, comparing severe with moderate CKD groups).</p><p>During the first 30 to 90 days on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, the risk for hemorrhagic events is markedly increased among those with moderate CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37,48,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,48,57-59</a>]. The reason for this may be that warfarin therapy is often started too aggressively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48,57,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,57,60</a>], which results in supratherapeutic INRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30,48,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,48,57</a>]. Moreover, these bleeding events in the early phase may be caused by some patient-inherent factors (eg, microangiopathy of cerebral arteries). This implies that those who have already taken warfarin for at least 90 days without any major bleeding complications may be a lower-risk group, with a smaller risk for future hemorrhagic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. Based on the increase in risk of bleeding during the early period of warfarin anticoagulation, we suggest reducing the starting warfarin dose to 2.5 mg daily for two days for patients with AF and an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Initial dosing'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest monitoring the INR several times per week during at least the first few weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy to facilitate safety. With regard to the high rate of bleedings during the first one to three months of the oral anticoagulant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37,48,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,48,57-59</a>], self-monitoring may provide a marked improvement in safety.
