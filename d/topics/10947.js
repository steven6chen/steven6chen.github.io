Multiple victim methanol poisonings can occur with illicit distillation (&quot;moonshine&quot;) or occult substitution for ethanol. Methanol poisoning outbreaks with hundreds of victims are rare, but continue to occur around the globe, overwhelming available critical care and hemodialysis infrastructure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>To provide proper management, clinicians must understand the metabolic activation of these alcohols to their toxic acid metabolites, the limitations of available laboratory tests, and the indications for treatment with antidotes, with or without hemodialysis.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication will be reviewed here. While there are differences between methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, there is substantial overlap and both the similarities and differences are described below. Isopropyl alcohol intoxication is considerably different, and is discussed separately, as is a general approach to the poisoned adult or child.

However, profound toxicity can ensue when these parent alcohols are metabolized in vivo (ie, oxidized, primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55124 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56013 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The methanol metabolite formate and the ethylene glycol metabolites glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate accumulate following large ingestions. Above plasma levels of approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of methanol or 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of ethylene glycol), these metabolites can cause specific end-organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formate causes retinal injury with optic disc hyperemia, edema, and eventually permanent blindness, as well as ischemic or hemorrhagic injury to the basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The renal failure is primarily due to glycolate-induced damage to tubules, although tubule obstruction from precipitated oxalate crystals may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Acidemia increases the ability of the toxic metabolites to penetrate cells, further depressing CNS function and causing a rapid downward spiral of hypoxia and acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like other simple alcohols, methanol and ethylene glycol are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral ingestion. Peak serum alcohol concentrations are reached within one to two hours. Two-step metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase leads to the production of toxic species. Methanol elimination follows zero-order kinetics in the absence of treatment, and has been estimated at 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> per hour following overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Pyridoxine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> are involved in minor elimination pathways of glycolate, an ethylene glycol metabolite, but it is not known if pyridoxine and thiamine supplementation accelerates metabolism along these minor pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

This is ideally done by retrieving the original container and consulting product databases, as well as interviewing the patient, relatives, and prehospital workers. Methanol and ethylene glycol are frequently found in high concentration in automotive <span class=\"nowrap\">coolant/antifreeze</span> and de-icing solutions, windshield wiper fluid, solvents, cleaners, fuels, and other industrial products. Most serious poisonings occur following ingestion. &quot;Antifreeze&quot; may also contain a different alcohol than originally suspected (eg, propylene glycol rather than ethylene glycol). Such information dramatically changes the treatment strategy, underscoring the need to obtain accurate information.</p><p>In the absence of treatment, an ingestion of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of either methanol or ethylene glycol (ie, parent alcohols) is considered lethal, and serious toxicity has been reported following ingestions of as little as one teaspoon of methanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Inhalation and dermal exposures rarely cause toxicity. Product labels rarely provide the concentrations of toxic alcohols. As an approximate guide, a 50 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">vol/vol</span> solution contains 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL</span> of methanol or 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL</span> of ethylene glycol.</p><p>It is important to clarify when the ingestion occurred and whether ethanol was also ingested. As mentioned above, ethanol competitively inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, thereby diminishing formation of toxic metabolites of the parent compound.</p><p>The intent of the exposure (whether accidental, suicidal, or homicidal) may only become apparent with closer investigation (eg, interview of friends and family). The identification of other potential victims depends upon understanding the circumstances of the exposure (eg, occult substitution for ethanol), and active case identification is essential when dealing with accidental methanol ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p>Complaints of visual blurring, central scotomata, and blindness suggest methanol poisoning.

Ethanol coingestion may exacerbate such symptoms. Coma, seizures, hyperpnea (Kussmaul-Kien respirations), and hypotension all suggest a substantial portion of the parent alcohol has been metabolized to its toxic byproducts.</p><p>An afferent pupillary defect is an ominous sign of advanced methanol poisoning. Eye examination in methanol poisoning may also reveal mydriasis, a retinal sheen due to retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the onset of methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity is delayed when ethanol is coingested. The possibility of concomitant ethanol and toxic alcohol ingestion must always be considered, particularly in alcoholics, who may ingest alcohol in any form.</p><p>Ethylene glycol metabolism can lead to cranial nerve palsies and tetany (thought to result from oxalate-induced hypocalcemia). Oliguria and hematuria may occur.

The toxic acid metabolites of methanol (formate) and ethylene glycol (glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate) exist primarily in a dissociated (ie, charged) form at physiologic pH; since these anions must be accompanied by a cation (mostly sodium), they do <strong>not</strong> contribute to the calculated osmolal gap.

Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> or ethanol should NOT be initiated during this observation period, as such treatment will prevent the development of acidosis even in patients with massive ingestions. Treatment with fomepizole or ethanol invalidates the above protocol.</p><p>Parents should be counseled about safe storage of household products and pharmaceuticals prior to discharge.</p><p>For those pediatric patients who do demonstrate signs of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, the diagnostic and treatment considerations described above for adults largely hold. The limited published experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> supports its safe and effective use in children using the same dosing protocol given above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, infants with inherited metabolic disorders such as methylmalonic acidemia present with features that resemble ethylene glycol poisoning, and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. The clinician should obtain organic acid testing in all infants presenting with unexplained metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organic-acidemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organic acidemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Groups of adolescents trying to become inebriated may consume toxic alcohols knowingly or accidentally in contaminated beverages.

In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses. The World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its website: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=336\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3887508272\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The methanol metabolite formate can cause retinal and basal ganglia injury, and the ethylene glycol metabolites can cause renal failure following large ingestions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methanol and ethylene glycol are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral ingestion. Peak serum alcohol concentrations are reached within one to two hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should make every effort to identify the source and nature of the exposure. This is ideally done by retrieving the original container and consulting product databases. It is important to clarify when the ingestion occurred, whether ethanol was also ingested, and the intent of the exposure (whether accidental, suicidal, or homicidal). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of either methanol or ethylene glycol is considered lethal, and serious toxicity has been reported following ingestions of as little as 8 g of methanol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complaints of visual blurring, central scotomata, and blindness suggest methanol poisoning. Flank pain and hematuria suggest ethylene glycol poisoning. Coma, seizures, hyperpnea, and hypotension all suggest a substantial portion of the parent alcohols has been metabolized to toxic acids. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few conditions other than methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication present with a profound metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> and most of these conditions present in a characteristic fashion (eg, status epilepticus, profound shock, ischemic bowel) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77464 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct testing of toxic alcohols is the preferred diagnostic test when available. If a &quot;solvent screen&quot; is performed, the clinician should clarify exactly which solvents are detected by the test. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls in laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few substances cause a very high (greater than 25 mOsm) osmolal gap, and most severely poisoned methanol and ethylene glycol patients manifest osmolal gaps of this magnitude shortly after ingestion. An unexplained, large osmolal gap is presumptive evidence of a recent methanol, ethylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol exposure in the appropriate clinical setting. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Plasma osmolal gap'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First assess and secure the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. If mechanical ventilation is required, large minute ventilations may be needed to prevent profound acidemia (pH &lt;7.1) in patients with severe intoxication. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Airway, breathing, circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning fare worse when systemic acidemia is present. For patients with a serum pH below 7.3, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Begin treatment with 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/kg</span> of sodium bicarbonate via IV bolus infusion. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment with sodium bicarbonate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibition therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> be initiated in any patient in whom the clinician has strong suspicion of poisoning with either methanol or ethylene glycol coupled with an elevated plasma osmolal gap, or acidemia, or a measured methanol or ethylene glycol concentration over 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> methanol [SI equivalent: methanol 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> ethylene glycol 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Fomepizole is loaded at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously, followed by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 12 hours, with adjustments for hemodialysis or after more than two days of therapy. If fomepizole is unavailable, we recommend treatment with ethanol in these same circumstances (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We provide cofactor therapy to all patients receiving ADH inhibition. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Cofactor therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend immediate hemodialysis be performed in the setting of a known methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion when the following conditions are present (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic acidosis, regardless of drug level</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevated serum levels of methanol or ethylene glycol (more than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [SI equivalent: methanol 15.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> ethylene glycol 8.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> unless arterial pH is above 7.3</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of end-organ damage (eg, visual changes, renal failure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We recommend treatment with hemodialysis if the clinician suspects a toxic alcohol ingestion in a patient with a severe, unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis and significant osmolal gap (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We generally refrain from using hemodialysis to treat patients with elevated ethylene glycol concentrations, provided their serum pH is near normal, their renal function is normal, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> is given. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultation with a medical toxicologist at a regional poison center is strongly recommended for all suspected exposures and for cases in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a>, ethanol, or hemodialysis therapy may be used. Consultation with nephrology and emergent hemodialysis should be immediately obtained for severely acidotic patients in whom the diagnosis appears likely, especially if accompanied by visual or renal impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated charcoal (AC), gastric lavage, and syrup of ipecac have no role in the management of toxic alcohol exposures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2132826096\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge James Winchester, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wallace EA, Green AS.
