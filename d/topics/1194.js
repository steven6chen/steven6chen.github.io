The ANC is usually lower in women than in men.

BEN is associated with a polymorphism of the <em>DARC</em> gene promoter that reduces expression of Duffy antigen (a chemokine receptor that is ordinarily present on red blood cells, but not on neutrophils) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

Altered neutrophil chemotaxis (due to reduced clearance of pro-inflammatory cytokines by loss of Duffy antigen), reduced neutrophil production, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decreased bone marrow storage pool may contribute to neutropenia in BEN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In practice, we repeat the ANC two or three times, at intervals of at least two weeks. While the ANC is generally &gt;1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> occasional patients may have ANC &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p>After the diagnosis is established, it is not necessary to further monitor the ANC in patients with BEN. However, the patient should be counseled that further evaluation is warranted if a pattern of recurrent or severe infections develops, as this is not compatible with the diagnosis of BEN.</p><p>It may be difficult to identify an appropriate ethnic background for BEN in some patients. In ambiguous cases, we test family members, since confidence in the diagnosis is reinforced by the finding of asymptomatic neutropenia in other family members. For some patients, we test for the presence of Duffy antigen; although the Duffy null phenotype is not specific for BEN, the presence of Duffy antigen on red blood cells effectively excludes this diagnosis.</p><p>Familial neutropenia is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with unexplained neutropenia in families from ethnic groups that are not typically associated with BEN.</p><p>There is no threshold value for ANC in a patient with presumed BEN that should trigger further evaluation. However, a pattern of recurrent infections is not compatible with a diagnosis of BEN and such a history requires consideration of other causes (eg, medications, viral suppression, other congenital neutropenia syndrome) and may benefit from referral to a hematologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow evaluation.
