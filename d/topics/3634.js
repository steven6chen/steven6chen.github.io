Pancreatic cysts may be detected in over 2 percent of patients who undergo abdominal imaging with multidetector computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for unrelated reasons. This frequency increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Pancreatic cysts can either be neoplastic (eg, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms) or non-neoplastic. Accurate cyst categorization is important, since non-neoplastic cysts require treatment only if symptomatic, whereas some of the pancreatic cystic neoplasms have significant malignant potential and should be resected.</p><p>This topic will review the classification of pancreatic cysts. An overview of pancreatic cystic neoplasms and issues related to pancreatic inflammatory fluid collections and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Efficacy and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis#H19602500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Local complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF PANCREATIC CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic lesions of the pancreas can be divided pathologically into inflammatory fluid collections, non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts, and pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs). Rarely, solid pancreatic tumors may also present as a pancreatic cyst (eg, islet cell tumor). Most pancreatic cysts are detected incidentally when abdominal imaging is performed for some other indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study of 341 patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for nonpancreatic indications, pancreatic cysts were noted in 9 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. PCNs account for more than half of pancreatic cysts, even in patients with a history of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Pancreatic cystic lesions can be an isolated finding, or they can be associated with an underlying disorder such as von Hippel-Lindau disease or polycystic kidney disease. In a study of 158 consecutive patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, 77 percent had a pancreatic abnormality, including 70 percent with cysts, 9 percent with serous cystadenomas, and 9 percent with neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pancreatic cysts are seen in 7 to 10 percent of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrarenal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrarenal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Pancreatic cysts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975903111\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory fluid collections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are not true epithelial cysts and typically represent local complications of acute pancreatitis. Inflammatory fluid collections were previously grouped together under the heading of pancreatic pseudocysts. In 2013, a revision of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis was published that updated the terminology used to describe pancreatic fluid collections to better reflect the underlying pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. According to the revised Atlanta classification, inflammatory fluid collections include acute peripancreatic fluid collections, pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute peripancreatic fluid collections occur in the setting of acute interstitial pancreatitis within four weeks of the onset of pancreatitis. They are typically extra-pancreatic and do not have a definable wall. The fluid contains no solid material, and there is no pancreatic necrosis present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudocysts represent more mature fluid collections that are usually outside the pancreas (though they may be intrapancreatic). They typically develop at least four weeks after acute pancreatitis. They have a well-defined wall, and as is the case with acute peripancreatic fluid collections, there should be no solid material or pancreatic necrosis present. Pseudocysts may also develop following pancreatic trauma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute necrotic collections occur in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis, may be adjacent to or involve the pancreas, have no definable wall, and may contain both liquid and solid material. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is a mature (typically developing at least four weeks after acute pancreatitis), encapsulated collection of pancreatic necrosis that may contain liquid and solid elements (with or without loculation). They may be intra- or extrapancreatic. </p><p/><p>It is important to remember that PCNs can sometimes cause acute pancreatitis, or patients presenting with acute pancreatitis may harbor an incidental PCN. As such, all cysts discovered at the time of acute pancreatitis cannot be assumed to be inflammatory. Review of prior imaging if available, clinical presentation and radiological features, and follow-up are important to make this distinction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-NEOPLASTIC PANCREATIC CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-neoplastic pancreatic cysts (NNPCs) include a variety of very rare cysts that are often asymptomatic and do not require resection. These include true cysts, retention cysts, mucinous non-neoplastic cysts, and lymphoepithelial cysts. They are typically diagnosed after surgical resection of a lesion that was thought to be a pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN) preoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">True cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are only a few cases reported of true cysts or &quot;benign epithelial cysts&quot; of the pancreas. These cystic lesions with a cuboidal epithelial lining have an unclear natural history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Retention cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retention cysts are small dilated pancreatic duct side branches arising due to obstruction (eg, from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or from inspissated protein debris seen in association with chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucinous non-neoplastic cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucinous non-neoplastic cysts have only recently been described and are exceedingly difficult to differentiate from PCNs. Like PCNs, mucinous non-neoplastic cysts are lined with a mucinous lining, but they lack any neoplastic features (eg, atypia) or ductal communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These lesions have an unclear natural history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoepithelial cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoepithelial cysts (LEC) are rare, benign, and usually asymptomatic cystic lesions. Often described as peripancreatic, these lesions are lined by mature keratinizing squamous epithelium surrounded by a distinct layer of lymphoid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may be required to differentiate an LEC from a PCN. FNA cytology usually reveals characteristic epithelial cells and small, mature lymphocytes in a background of keratinaceous debris, anucleate squamous cells, and multinucleated histiocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Resection is recommended in symptomatic cases, but not for asymptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC CYSTIC NEOPLASMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) is important, since some have malignant potential. PCNs are categorized using the WHO histological classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69594 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There are four subtypes of PCNs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serous cystic tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs)</p><p/><p>The key demographic and clinical features of PCNs are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57759 \">table 2</a>). Each of the subtypes has benign and malignant forms.</p><p>The relative frequencies of the different PCNs were examined in a retrospective series of 851 patients undergoing surgical resection for a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas between 1978 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms accounted for 38 percent of lesions, mucinous cystic neoplasms for 23 percent, serous cystic tumors for 16 percent, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms for 3 percent. When only the 376 patients who had surgery between 2005 and 2011 were considered, 49 percent had intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 16 percent had mucinous cystic neoplasms, 12 percent had serous cystic tumors, and 5 percent had solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. However, this series is subject to sampling bias, as it only evaluated resected PCNs. Most branch duct IPMNs and serous cystadenomas do not require resection; thus the relative frequency of these lesions may have been underestimated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serous cystic tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most serous cystic tumors are serous cystadenomas, which are benign neoplasms lined by glycogen-rich cells that originate from pancreatic centro-acinar cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66608\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66608 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61511 \">picture 1</a>). These lesions can arise anywhere in the pancreas and are most commonly diagnosed in women over the age 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>Varieties include microcystic serous cystadenomas, which are composed of multiple small cystic spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73288%7EGAST%2F82546%7EGAST%2F71673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73288 graphicRef82546 graphicRef71673 \">picture 2A-C</a>), and oligocystic serous cystadenomas, which are composed of fewer, larger cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The oligocystic variant can be difficult to distinguish from an MCN or branch duct IPMN, which can have a similar appearance. Unless symptomatic, these can be followed conservatively since malignant degeneration is exceedingly rare.

MCNs exhibit variable cellular atypia and secrete mucin similar to IPMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In contrast to IPMNs, MCNs demonstrate ovarian-like stroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], typically arise in the pancreatic tail or body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52386\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52386 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and do not communicate with the pancreatic duct. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms'</a> below.)</p><p>Due to the risk of malignancy developing, resection is recommended in appropriate candidates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are mucin-producing papillary neoplasms of the pancreatic ductal system that exhibit variable cellular atypia and cause dilation of the pancreatic ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. IPMNs have an equal sex distribution, with incidence peaking over the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct (main duct IPMN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51921\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51921 \">image 2</a>), its side branches (branch duct IPMN), or both (mixed-type IPMN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101892\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101892 \">image 3</a>). They are often multifocal or diffuse, and can extend microscopically from the clinically apparent lesions.</p><p>The characteristic pathologic features include the diffuse or segmental dilation of the pancreatic duct without stricturing, the intraductal expansion of mucin-producing ductal cells (which may be flat or project into the lumen), and the dilation of either one or both pancreatic orifices, through which there is a copious secretion of mucus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52643\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52643 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Histologically, the columnar mucin-producing cells can be hyperplastic or dysplastic. They can be further classified based upon the degree of dysplasia exhibited by the epithelial cells as adenoma (mild dysplasia), borderline (moderate dysplasia), or carcinoma (high-grade dysplasia), with or without invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-pancreatic-cysts/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Management involves a combination of surveillance and resection depending upon the risk of malignancy and patient-related factors.
