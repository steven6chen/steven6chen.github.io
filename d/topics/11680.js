The wide range in reported prevalence reflects in part the use of different criteria for neuropsychiatric disease. Similarly, the reported frequencies of individual neurologic and psychiatric manifestations also vary widely, depending in part upon the population studied, the case definition used, and methods used for screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has formulated case definitions, reporting standards, and diagnostic testing recommendations for 19 neuropsychiatric SLE syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51238 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE are varied and may be classified as primary neurologic and psychiatric disease (eg, related to direct involvement of the neuropsychiatric system) or secondary disease (eg, related to complications of the disease and its treatment) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63649 \">table 2</a>).

The diagnostic approach to patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations is presented separately. Other clinical manifestations of SLE are also discussed separately.

Identification of these diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms has helped to uncover possible mechanisms of immune-mediated neuropsychiatric disorders and has permitted more accurate and effective therapy. For the purposes of this discussion, the term lupus cerebritis is used to refer to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of lupus that appear to have an organic basis, rather than a specific pathophysiologic mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nervous system involvement in SLE was initially thought to be due to vasculitis. This idea was challenged, however, by investigators who found that true vasculitis was a rare finding in patients with SLE and neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, many patients may have a vasculopathy that may cause direct injury and can also affect the blood-brain barrier, thereby allowing antibodies to enter the nervous system. This vasculopathy is characterized by a small to moderate perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells, without destruction (eg, fibrinoid necrosis) of the blood vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. There may be small infarcts due to luminal occlusion.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the vasculopathy and the vasculitis are not known. Certain autoantibodies have been associated with different aspects of central nervous system (CNS) lupus but not with the vascular disease itself (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-neuropsychiatric-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Serologic studies'</a>). Antiphospholipid antibodies may play a role in the vasculopathy in at least some patients, since they have been associated with stroke syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

This section will review these disorders and will present a general approach to therapy of the individual conditions. Treatment tends to vary with the manifestation. As examples, stroke due to antiphospholipid antibodies is treated with anticoagulants, and cognitive defects may respond to steroids, antidepressants, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiolytics. The possible role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and plasmapheresis in certain settings is discussed separately at the end of this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive dysfunction, manifested by impairments in mental activities (eg, memory, abstract thinking, and judgment), is very prevalent among patients with SLE. When a battery of neuropsychological tests is used to assess cognitive function, deficits may be present in 20 to 80 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropsychiatric-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Cognitive defects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLE may be associated with a significant increase in the risk of stroke and of premature death due to cerebrovascular disease. Strokes have been reported in up to 19 percent of patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. An analysis of hospital discharges for young patients with stroke revealed that SLE is a risk factor for stroke with an age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of 1.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A longitudinal cohort of 490 SLE patients found that younger patients are at substantially increased risk of stroke compared with age-matched population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The standardized incidence ratio of stroke in this cohort of SLE patients was 2.02 (95 % CI 1.30 &ndash; 3.81), which was significantly higher than in the general population. Among patients with SLE, baseline disease activity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension are risk factors for stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Strokes in the setting of SLE may be particularly severe. In a prospective cohort of patients with SLE, a high proportion, 77 percent, of incident strokes were associated with an NIH stroke scale of &gt;6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In another observational study of 2688 Canadian patients with SLE, the risk of death due to stroke or other cerebrovascular disease was doubled when compared with non-SLE controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, according to another study, the prognosis of patients with SLE hospitalized with stroke did not appear to be substantially different than that of non-SLE patients; fatality rates were 12.3 percent for both groups in the hospital-based study cited earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiphospholipid antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other reports in the literature also report a high association between antiphospholipid antibodies and stroke in SLE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. One study, for example, evaluated 96 patients with SLE and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (primarily stroke, transient ischemic attack, and seizures) that were not attributable to any cause other than SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Antiphospholipid antibodies were present in 55 versus 20 percent in a control group with SLE and no CNS or thromboembolic disease. Only about one-half of these patients had evidence of active lupus at the onset of CNS disease. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were primarily associated with small high-intensity white matter lesions on MRI that were suggestive of vasculopathy.</p><p>The presence of persistent elevated aPL antibodies of different specificities may increase the risk of stroke more than a single aPL does. This was illustrated in a study of 125 patients with SLE, 35 of whom developed a cerebral infarction; the presence of a combination of <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-cardiolipin/beta2-gylcoprotein</span> I and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin</span> antibodies was strongly associated with cerebral infarction, more so than a positive test for a lupus anticoagulant alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Furthermore, the combination of these antibodies in vitro resulted in activation of platelets, which could contribute to a hypercoagulable state.

As an example, hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis, both associated with chronic steroid therapy, are common risk factors for stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been identified as a risk factor for stroke and other thrombotic events in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Other factors, such as infection, vasculitis, valvular heart disease, emboli, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis, can affect large or small blood vessels, thereby causing large vessel occlusive disease and infarction, or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/60,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62,63</a>]. Hemorrhagic stroke, due to intracerebral or subarachnoid bleeding, may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. SLE is a risk factor for all stroke subtypes, except for subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large vessel disease may be due to coagulopathy, cardiogenic embolism, vasculitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> premature atherosclerosis. Patients with hypertension, a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-like picture, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aPL are at particular risk for developing stroke with resulting hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, ocular field defects, or aphasia. One study evaluated 30 patients with symptomatic large vessel occlusive disease that was documented angiographically. The average age at stroke onset was 35 years, and at least 86 percent had active SLE at the time of their strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The short-term death rate was 40 percent in this study, and the recurrent stroke rate was 13 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIAs and recurrent small infarcts are the most common neurologic manifestations in patients with aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In some cases, however, the combination of cognitive defects and an abnormal magnetic resonance image (MRI) is sometimes the first clue to the presence of aPL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS vasculitis due to SLE typically presents with a distinct syndrome of fever, severe headaches, and confusional episodes, with rapid progression to psychotic symptoms, seizures, and coma. Evidence of active lupus is usually demonstrable (eg, hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] antibody), and, in our experience, the MRI or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is abnormal, with focal defects.

These individuals had active diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, cerebritis, myelitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasculitis despite six cycles of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. At a median follow-up of 25 months, all patients were free from signs of active lupus, and renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function and serologic markers had improved despite either no immunosuppression or small residual doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.

An autoimmune mechanism and a vasculopathy have been implicated in some. Secondary factors including infections associated with chronic immunosuppressive therapy, metabolic complications of other organ system failure (eg, uremia), hypertension, and toxic effects of immunosuppressive therapy may play a role in some cases. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive dysfunction, manifested by impairments in mental activities (eg, memory, abstract thinking, and judgment), is very prevalent among patients with SLE (20 to 80 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropsychiatric-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strokes have been reported in up to 19 percent of patients with SLE and may be particularly severe. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are prevalent in patients with stroke and SLE. Stroke mechanisms are heterogenous in SLE and include arterial and venous thrombosis, cardiogenic embolism, and small vessel infarcts. Vasculitis is an unusual stroke mechanism in this setting. Chronic anticoagulation therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is indicated in most patients with ischemic stroke syndromes due to aPL. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Stroke syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures develop in 10 to 20 percent of patients with SLE. The evaluation and management of seizures in the setting of SLE does not differ from that in the general clinical setting, except that glucocorticoids may be administered for seizures arising in the setting of an acute inflammatory event. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache is relatively common in patients with SLE, but there does not appear to be a causal relationship. Thus, headache alone in a patient with SLE does not require additional investigation beyond the evaluation that would be performed for a patient with headache who does not have SLE. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with SLE develop a peripheral neuropathy that is probably due to vasculopathy of small arteries supplying the affected nerves. Autonomic neuropathy has also been reported in some patients. Neuropathies generally respond to therapy with glucocorticoids in moderate to higher doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> but not all patients improve. A complete response may take weeks to months to be clinically apparent, because of the slow pace of nerve regeneration. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SLE also may experience less common disorders, including movement disorders, cranial neuropathies, and eye involvement and, rarely, transverse myelitis and meningitis. Other rare disorders include the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), hyperprolactinemia, sensorineural hearing loss, and brainstem and cerebellar syndromes. Treatment varies, depending upon the specific disease manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Uncommon neurologic syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> has also been evaluated in a limited number of studies. We consider the use of intravenous cyclophosphamide in patients with failure to respond to a one week course of high-dose oral glucocorticoids or to pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, who exhibit acute or recent onset of severe neurologic symptoms such as refractory seizures or optic neuritis in the absence of another cause and evidence of active inflammation in the brain by neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation. Other agents have also been used in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Use of more aggressive therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Cyclophosphamide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10835409\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editors of UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Shahram Khoshbin, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sibley JT, Olszynski WP, Decoteau WE, Sundaram MB.
