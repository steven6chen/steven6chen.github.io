Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is rarely performed in clinical laboratories for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultures usually yield a polymicrobial flora or may be falsely negative due to inadequate sampling, transport, or anaerobic culture techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infecting flora is usually polymicrobial, requiring the tedious task of separating multiple different bacteria for identification and susceptibility testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor quality control of in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing limits use of these tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The practical application of these observations is that complete culture results with susceptibility tests are often labor intensive, time consuming, expensive, and incomplete. Results other than Gram stain are not available in a clinically relevant time frame. Thus, antibiotic decisions for anaerobic pathogens are often best made based upon predicted susceptibility patterns according to the Gram stain and the anatomical site of infection. In contrast, appropriate therapy for the aerobic component of mixed infection is determined based upon culture and susceptibility testing results that typically can be completed more quickly.</p><p/><p>Based on these practical issues, the 2012 edition of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [NCCLS]) Working Group on Anaerobic Susceptibility Testing has restricted recommending this testing to the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaerobic-bacterial-infections/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To monitor local and regional resistance patterns</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To test new antimicrobial agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To select antibiotics that are critical for individual patient management because of:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Critical illness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Known resistance of an organism or species</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent infection despite appropriate antibiotics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Difficulty with empiric decision based on precedent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To confirm antimicrobial activity when long courses of antibiotics are required</p><p/><p>Most clinical laboratories will not perform susceptibility tests unless they are specifically requested.

Of more than 2500 <em>B. fragilis</em> isolates, nearly 30 percent were nonsusceptible (intermediate or resistant) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> between 2000 and 2004, but 48 percent were nonsusceptible in 2007. There was also a significant increase in resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam among other <em>Bacteroides</em> spp, <em>Prevotella </em>spp, and <em>Fusobacterium </em>spp. An increase in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> resistance was also observed among isolates of <em>B. fragilis</em>, <em>Fusobacterium </em>spp, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci other than <em>Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</em>. However, it is unclear if these resistance patterns represent an atypical experience that is geographically restricted, nonstandardized culture techniques, or an important emerging trend.</p><p>The high rate of resistance of the <em>B. fragilis</em> group to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> has been an increasing trend in the United States and Europe, but beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations remain active against most isolates. Carbapenem resistance is now being reported, but it remains rare in most of the world.</p><p>The conclusion from these observations is that <em>B. fragilis</em> is the major anaerobic pathogen in blood cultures and at infected sites with intraabdominal and pelvic infections. Antibiotic selection is generally made empirically based on susceptibility test results from sentinel laboratories. These reports indicate that the most predictably active drugs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, carbapenems, and beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. These agents are generally active against other anaerobic bacteria as well. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> and fluoroquinolones no longer have reliable activity against <em>B. fragilis</em>. Note that there have been substantial changes in the susceptibility of <em>B. fragilis</em> in recent years and some geographic idiosyncrasies as well, so these dynamic changes need to be followed. Most intraabdominal infections are caused by not only anaerobic but also aerobic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microaerophilic bacteria; the latter pathogens are usually easily cultured, and treatment decisions for them can be based on conventional methods.</p><p>Infections above the diaphragm usually reflect the orodental flora, which does not include the <em>B. fragilis</em> group. Major anaerobic pathogens in orodental and pulmonary infections are <em>Fusobacterium</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and peptostreptococci. Many of these strains produce beta-lactamase, making all beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins) poor options. The favored oral agents for empiric use are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaerobic-bacterial-infections/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

These three infections usually represent a continuum. The initial lesion is endodontal; the infection progresses to the periapical region, and it may then extend through the mandible to involve the potential spaces created by fascial insertions along the mandible. Factors responsible for this progression are poorly understood, but one hypothesis is that a &quot;network of bacteria&quot; comprising the gingival microbiome collectively contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaerobic-bacterial-infections/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Major agents of the flora also found in infected perioral infections include <em>Fusobacterium</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Porphyromonas</em>, and <em>Treponema</em> spp. An infrequent but distinct form is necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, sometimes known as Vincent angina or trench mouth. This is a relatively fulminant infection associated with severe pain, tissue destruction, pseudomembrane formation, and putrid discharge. The bacterial agent is not well established, although anaerobic spirochetes have been detected within tissue at the advancing edge of inflammation, and antibiotic treatment directed against anaerobes is necessary.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In fact, the clues that lead clinicians to suspect anaerobic infection are typically absent during this early or pneumonitis stage of infection. As an example, patients rarely have putrid sputum and are often diagnosed as having atypical pneumonia. Nevertheless, this should be considered in patients who are aspiration-prone and have an infiltrate in a dependent pulmonary segment. The usual features of anaerobic infection are seen in the later stages of disease, when there is likely to be putrid discharge and necrosis of tissue with abscess formation or empyema, as well as weight loss and anemia as indicators of chronic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical clues to this diagnosis include a predisposition to aspirate, infection in a dependent pulmonary segment, and putrid sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaerobic-bacterial-infections/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The indolent course of many of these infections may serve as a distinguishing clinical clue. Whereas patients with pneumococcal pneumonia often have the abrupt onset of symptoms accompanied by a shaking chill and a rapid progression of symptoms, these features are rare with an anaerobic pleuropulmonary infection. By contrast, these patients often present with weight loss, anemia, and chronic pulmonary complaints, all features that are relatively uncommon in pneumonia due to most aerobic bacteria other than mycobacteria.
