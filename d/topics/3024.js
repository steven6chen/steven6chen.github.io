Each of these bones has a hole in the center. When stacked, the bones form a hollow tube that protects the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord and nerves &ndash; The spinal cord runs through the vertebrae. Nerves branch from the spinal cord and pass in between the vertebrae. From there they connect to the arms, the legs, and the organs. (This is why problems in the back can cause leg pain or bladder problems.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Rubbery discs sit in between each of the vertebrae to add cushion and allow movement. The discs that sit between the vertebrae have a tough outer shell and jelly-like center. The outer shell of the discs can sometimes break open, spilling the jelly material inside. This is what doctors call a &quot;herniated disc.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments &ndash; Together the muscles, tendons, and ligaments are called the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These soft tissues support the back and help hold it together.</p><p/><p>Cauda equina syndrome can happen because of changes in the back that affect the nerves. For example, cauda equina syndrome can happen because of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A herniated disc &ndash; The material from a ruptured disc can press on or irritate the nerves in the cauda equina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection or inflammation &ndash; Different types of infection or inflammation can damage or irritate nerves in the cauda equina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; In people with cancer, tumors can form within the spine and press on the nerves in the cauda equina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal stenosis &ndash; Spinal stenosis is a condition in which the vertebrae form bumps called bone spurs. These bumps can squeeze or press on the nerves in the cauda equina. In people with spinal stenosis, the discs between the vertebrae also tend to dry up and shrink. That causes the space between the vertebrae to get smaller, sometimes pinching nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180778986\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of cauda equina syndrome, see a doctor or nurse right away. Cauda equina syndrome is a medical emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180779001\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will need to find out what is causing your symptoms. You will likely have an MRI. This is an imaging test that can create detailed pictures of the spinal cord and nearby tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180779016\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cauda equina syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for cauda equina syndrome involves treating whatever is affecting the nerves and causing the symptoms. Often, that means having surgery to remove bits of bone or discs, or tumors. If the cause of the cauda equina syndrome is a tumor, radiation to shrink the tumor might be an option. If the cause is an infection or inflammation, medicines to treat those problems might be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180779031\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=herniated-disc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Herniated disc (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-stenosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spinal stenosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
