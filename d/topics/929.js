Dosing methods for commonly used drugs are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F90705\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90705 \">table 2</a>). When optimal dosing method for a specific drug is unknown, it is reasonable to base doses on LBW, except for highly lipophilic drugs for which TBW should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, because of the complexities of pharmacokinetics and dynamics introduced by various types of obesity, the choice of the most appropriate dosing scalar for some drugs is debated. Improved dosing algorithms for target controlled infusion devices in obese patients (not available for use in the US) have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Modified drug dosing is required because of obesity-related increases in LBW, cardiac output, and blood volume, as well as changes in regional blood flow; these can affect peak plasma concentration, clearance, and elimination half-life of many drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of distribution (V<sub>d</sub>) is the principal determinant of loading dose of drugs. The V<sub>d</sub> of relatively lipophilic drugs is increased by obesity; less lipophilic drugs have little to no change in V<sub>d</sub> in obese patients, as blood flow to fat tissue is lower than that to vessel-rich or lean tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. V<sub>d</sub> is largely dependent on the physiochemical attributes of a drug and varies with plasma protein binding and tissue blood flow, but changes are not consistent for all drugs within a category, and in many cases have not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug clearance is generally higher in obese individuals than non-obese individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is largely controlled by hepatic and renal physiology. Obesity affects hepatic metabolic pathways in different ways, with some only slightly and others significantly enhanced in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The guiding principle should be to use short acting and minimally fat soluble agents whenever feasible to allow for rapid recovery of consciousness, protective reflexes, and mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p>Due to the high prevalence of sleep apnea in obese patients, and consequent sensitivity to sedatives, the use of long-acting respiratory depressants should be minimized in obese patients regardless of technique chosen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13717544\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoidance of general anesthesia is often considered in obese patients (particularly those with obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]) to avoid the potential for airway and respiratory problems, when other anesthetic techniques are feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Neuraxial anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks offer the advantages of improved postoperative pain control, reduced use of opioids for postoperative analgesia, and consequently decreased potential for drug-induced respiratory depression. </p><p>Peripheral nerve blocks with ultrasound guidance appear to be safe in obese patients, with relatively high block success rates, when expertise and appropriate equipment are available. However, obesity may make peripheral nerve block more difficult to perform, and may be associated with higher block failure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of combined ultrasound guidance and nerve stimulation for single shot interscalene blocks, a higher BMI was associated with prolonged, more difficult placement and less successful blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, in a retrospective review of ultrasound guided perineural catheter placement for continuous peripheral nerve block, there were no differences in catheter insertion time or success rates in obese patients, compared with non-obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Similar to non-obese patients, ultrasound guidance for peripheral nerve blocks may be beneficial in obese patients compared with nerve stimulator or landmark based approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks#H1935393474\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound guidance'</a>.)</p><p>In one small randomized study involving obese patients who underwent lateral popliteal sciatic block, ultrasound guidance was associated with faster and less painful block placement and higher patient satisfaction, compared with nerve stimulation. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Obesity may be a risk factor for catheter related infection.

Several studies in nonobese patients that compared noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement at the forearm with the upper arm have reported a trend towards higher systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures in the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>].

Both the upper arm and forearm NIBP measurements of systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures showed unacceptable precision and bias, defined as an absolute difference &gt;10 mmHg, compared with invasive blood pressure. In this study, NIBP measurement of MAP at the upper arm showed a trend towards underestimating invasive measurement. </p><p>A conical shaped blood pressure cuff is commercially available and may be an option for improved non-invasive blood pressure measurement accuracy in obese patients.

One reason is that obese patients are more likely to require controlled ventilation to prevent hypoventilation during spontaneous respiration, and during positive-pressure ventilation, an SGA may not maintain a seal at the higher airway pressures needed in obese patients. Obesity-specific criteria for the use of a supraglottic airway have not been established. However, we consider factors including extent and distribution of obesity, type of surgery, length of surgery, and patient position to determine when its use is appropriate; in patients with BMI over 40, primarily abdominal obesity, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/thoracic</span> surgery, duration over two hours, and planned head-down positioning, we prefer to control ventilation with an endotracheal tube. When SGAs are used, second-generation devices designed for controlled ventilation, which allow for higher seal pressures and provide a gastric vent, are frequently employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
