The combination of screening all adult primary care patients to identify individuals with unhealthy use and a brief counseling intervention has been proposed as a population-wide, preventive intervention in primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical trials support the use of screening and brief intervention in adults who have unhealthy alcohol use but not a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. Screening is also the first step in identifying patients with a substance use disorder.</p><p>The DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, substance abuse and substance dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, substance use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, substance dependence is approximately comparable to substance use disorder, moderate to severe subtype, while substance abuse is similar to the mild subtype. Substance use disorders are important to identify so that appropriate counseling and pharmacotherapy can be offered.</p><p>This topic reviews screening tests for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use in primary care. Treatment of patients screening positive with a brief intervention, and the efficacy of screening combined with a brief intervention, are described separately.

The combined efficacy of screening and brief intervention is described separately.

Clinical trials have not found brief intervention to be effective for drugs other than alcohol. Screening can be done for other reasons besides prevention of substance use consequences, such as identification of comorbidity, to inform prescribing of psychoactive medications, and to assist in the diagnosis of related conditions.

Brief questionnaires are easier for clinicians to memorize and use. Some longer, more complex tools (eg, with multiple response options that require scoring) provide assessment or risk information that can be useful for brief intervention, but that benefit may be outweighed by the added burden.</p><p>Many tools are available for detecting unhealthy alcohol use. Fewer are available for drug use and for nonmedical use of prescription drugs (use for the feeling it causes). Most screening questionnaires are validated against diagnostic interview reference standards, though some add laboratory testing or future consequences to these reference standards. In part because of limitations with laboratory testing, the best reference standard for current unhealthy substance use is a diagnostic interview (to identify substance use disorders) and a calendar-based questionnaire to determine consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Ideally, the questionnaire used for screening for unhealthy use would be one that was used in trials that demonstrate efficacy of brief intervention.</p><p>Screening is insufficient for someone already known to have unhealthy substance use. For these patients, a full assessment for substance use disorders is more appropriate.

The AUDIT-C, which has some advantages over the single-item test, may be made feasible for use in some settings, eg, if embedded with associated decision support in an electronic health record. Although other screening tests have been validated, none have advantages over the single item screening, the AUDIT-C, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for use in primary care settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20772335\"><span class=\"h3\">Single-item screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several single-item alcohol screening questions have been proposed and tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. They are brief, memorizable, and require no scoring. One, validated in primary care in a single cross-sectional study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], is asked following, &ldquo;Do you sometimes drink beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages?&rdquo;:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many times in the past year have you had five (four for women) or more drinks in a day?</p><p/><p>The test is scored positive when the response is greater than 0 or when the patient states he or she is having difficulty coming up with the correct number (because it is therefore greater than 0). A positive test is 82 percent sensitive and 79 percent specific for unhealthy alcohol use. In a two-site cross sectional study of 459 adult primary care patients, the item was similarly accurate when self-administered on touchscreen tablet computers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1272399\"><span class=\"h3\">AUDIT-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AUDIT-C is a screening test comprised of three items on excess consumption from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53246 \">table 1</a>). The questions, below, have been validated primarily in male veterans but studies demonstrating validity in primary care and other populations are beginning to appear.

As with the full AUDIT, it is best to alter the third question by replacing &ldquo;six&rdquo; with &ldquo;four&rdquo; when used in women, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521965\"><span class=\"h3\">AUDIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AUDIT is the most widely validated instrument (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72626 \">figure 1</a>). With 10 items, which take two to three minutes to complete, the AUDIT is not brief and does require scoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Studies specifically focused on primary care settings in the United States suggest using lower scores (eg, four to seven) as positive for optimal sensitivity given the low cost and consequences of false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We find it most useful to alter the number of drinks (particularly in the third question) to &ldquo;5 or more&rdquo; to account for United States drink sizes and to &ldquo;4 or more&rdquo; for administration to women, and using a cutoff of 5 for men and 3 for women (the traditional cutoff widely published is 8 or greater) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/17,21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,24</a>]. A score of 20 or greater suggests the presence of alcohol dependence. The AUDIT was used in a large multisite international randomized trial of brief intervention in primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1272522\"><span class=\"h3\">CAGE questions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The four CAGE alcohol screening questions are geared towards detection of DSM-IV diagnoses of substance abuse and dependence.

The CAGE is not recommended as a screening tool but it can be useful for quickly finding out if someone who screens positive on a single-item screening question has or has had a more severe problem (by answering two or more in the affirmative).

These additions increase the number of screening items to seven with little advantage over the AUDIT-C (though advantages include the facts that scoring is not needed, and that responses to CAGE questions provide content for discussion of consequences during brief counseling).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1272541\"><span class=\"h3\">Special populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening tools have been validated for certain sub-populations (ie, women, pregnant women, elderly, adolescents).

While not ideal, however, if a practice cannot or does not implement routine universal screening with questionnaires, then testing for serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin can detect very heavy drinking. This laboratory test option would be better than no screening, and in fact when added to questionnaires it can detect heavy use among some who are negative by questionnaire and is cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Sensitivity and specificity for non-tobacco substance use was 100 and 84 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H27630687\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p>Because marijuana is now more widely legal, and because medical marijuana is often not prescribed (patients are certified and doses and frequencies are not usually specified by clinicians), single screening questions may miss recreational use or use beyond that recommended by a clinician. One solution is to remove the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; from the single item. Another is to add a question about frequency of marijuana use (eg &ldquo;How many times in the past year have you used marijuana?&rdquo;).

Testing has not been well studied in a general preventive healthcare context that relies on trust and a collaborative relationship between patient and clinician. The clinician needs to inform the patient of the testing and its purpose, which means a discussion must occur, during which time one could simply ask screening questions instead. If the patient is informed testing will be done, it could increase the validity of the self-report questionnaire, but introduce an element of mistrust. </p><p>Testing is further complicated by the need to test for a wide range of drugs, and does not distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate use of prescription drugs.

class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p>A problematic pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following occurring within a 12-month period:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use of the substance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by or exacerbated by its effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused

class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal.</p><p/><p>Current severity can be specified in the diagnosis based on the number of symptoms present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span

class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brief assessment strategies for a substance use disorder are preferable to full diagnostic interviews in the context of screening and brief intervention due to time constraints in primary care. However, these strategies, described below, have not been studied extensively for this purpose. Related strategies can also be useful to identify the presence and severity of the substance use disorder, as well as consequences of use, which provides useful information for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/4,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,61</a>]. The main purpose of the brief assessment is to identify consequences of use to discuss with patients, and to identify moderate to severe disorders in patients for whom treatment goals are different.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a single question has been used for screening, then a moderate to severe substance use disorder should be identified by asking patients about DSM-5 symptoms. Such questions can also be useful to identify symptoms and consequences of use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a questionnaire that provides severity information has been used for screening, then that result may provide sufficient initial assessment information.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A threshold severity score for some screening instruments has been associated with a DSM-IV diagnosis of substance dependence. (See <a href=\"#H521965\" class=\"local\">'AUDIT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1272399\" class=\"local\">'AUDIT-C'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1272522\" class=\"local\">'CAGE questions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25165357\" class=\"local\">'ASSIST'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An affirmative response to specific questions on some screening instruments suggests the presence of dependence (and therefore, likely, moderate to severe DSM5 disorder). An example is the &ldquo;eye-opener&rdquo; question on the CAGE. (See <a href=\"#H1272522\" class=\"local\">'CAGE questions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two single-item questions have been used to identify DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol abuse or dependence (and therefore would likely similarly identify a DSM 5 disorder) in patients with unhealthy alcohol use, with a sensitivity ranging from 77 to 95 percent and specificity from 62 to 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The two items are:&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the past year, have you sometimes been under the influence of alcohol in situations where you could have caused an accident or gotten hurt?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have there often been times when you had a lot more to drink than you intended to have?</p><p/><p>A question about prior treatment for an SUD can provide a quick entry point into the treatment of an ongoing or recurrent disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256368076\"><span class=\"h3\">Implications of screening for brief intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a substance use disorder has implications for subsequent care. A brief intervention for a patient in primary care with unhealthy substance use, including a <strong>mild</strong> substance use disorder, would be aimed at abstinence or reduced substance use. The optimal goal of brief intervention in primary care for a patient diagnosed with a <strong>moderate to severe</strong> substance use disorder would be for the patient to enter and participate in SUD specialty care. Patients at risk for withdrawal (patients with physical dependence or consumption of current daily risky amounts) would first undergo detoxification. Some interventions may be done in the primary care setting if expertise is available and the structure of the practice supports it.
