It is often first recognized in early childhood. ADHD can affect a child's thinking, performance in school, behavior, feelings, and relationships with others. It often continues into adulthood.</p><p>Treatments for ADHD include medicines, behavior training, counseling, and changes at school <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> at home. These treatments can be used alone or in combination. The best treatment or combination of treatments depends on your child's situation. A doctor or nurse can guide you and your child as treatment begins.</p><p>The treatment of ADHD disorder in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. A topic that discusses the symptoms and diagnosis of ADHD is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about ADHD in children is available by subscription.

Most experts agree that unrecognized and untreated ADHD can have serious consequences, including school failure and drop out, depression, poor behavior, failed relationships, poor performance in the workplace, and increased risk of accidents. Treatment can help a child to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have better relationships with parents, teachers, siblings, or peers (eg, play without fighting at recess)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform better in school (eg, finish school work)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow rules (eg, not appear to be disobedient to the teacher)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">What treatment is best?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral treatments usually are recommended for preschool-age children. Medications are sometimes added if necessary. The most effective treatment for most school-aged children with ADHD is a stimulant medicine. Behavioral treatments and counseling are sometimes added if needed.</p><p>Parents who prefer that their school-aged child avoid medicine should work closely with the child's doctor or nurse. While it is reasonable to consider using behavioral treatments alone, this may not work as well as medicine alone.</p><p>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, in partnership with the American Psychiatric Association, has developed a <a href=\"http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/Docs/resource_centers/adhd/adhd_parents_medication_guide_201305.pdf&amp;token=zLxYJ+TufCeyJoJR/OuaVsOj1RBgnFPlloaGGWfwrEi2fseOdNmpZoYP0wWJYxFrcDBV3TKxPqKAR+RprDFdZVwDhhexEHAWmI/7L5+az44LotPMaRBsvnrQldmyY9XMNbpchwbI0re3XvbJsBSVPw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">medicine guide for parents</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528015024\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children with ADHD have other problems, including problems with learning, anxiety, mood, or trouble sleeping. Treatment of the associated problems may help improve ADHD symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functioning at school or in social settings. However, treatment of these associated problems may not replace the need for medication or behavioral treatment of ADHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHD STIMULANT MEDICINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulant medicines are the first-line ADHD treatment for school-aged children. However, there are criteria that must be met before medicine is considered. In addition, parents (and the child, when appropriate) should understand the need for close monitoring during treatment.</p><p>Despite their name, stimulants do not cause a child with ADHD to become more stimulated but instead improve communication between several areas of the brain. This helps to improve attention, concentration, and self-control. However, medicines do not cure ADHD or teach the child to behave, work well with others, follow rules in school, or be motivated. Behavioral treatments can be added to the medicine to address these issues.</p><p>Two medicines, methylphenidate and amphetamines, are the most commonly used stimulants for the treatment of ADHD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methylphenidate &ndash; Methylphenidate (sample brand names: Concerta, Focalin, Metadate, Methylin, Ritalin) is available as a tablet, capsule, and liquid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short-acting formulas are usually started with one dose per day and then increased to twice or three times daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Long-acting formulas are usually taken once per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A methylphenidate patch (brand name: Daytrana) is also available; the child wears the patch on the skin for up to nine hours per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amphetamines &ndash; Amphetamines are also available in short-acting and long-acting formulas (sample brand names: Adderall, Dexedrine, Dextrostat, Vyvanse).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">How well do stimulants work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the short-acting stimulant dose is correct, it will begin to work within 30 to 40 minutes. If the dose is not correct (for example, if the dose is too small, which is common when starting treatment), most experts recommend waiting three to seven days before increasing the dose. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when or if you should increase your child's stimulant dose.</p><p>At least 80 percent of children with ADHD will respond to a stimulant. However, it is not clear if stimulants have a long-term benefit for the child's thinking, school performance, behavior, or feelings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulant medicines have a long history of being safe and working well when used properly, and few children have serious side effects. Stimulants are not addictive. Methylphenidate and amphetamines are equally likely to cause side effects. Some of the most common side effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble with sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>Less common side effects include increased heart rate and blood pressure, headache, social withdrawal, nervousness, irritability, stomach pain, poor circulation in the hands and feet, and moodiness.</p><p>Many of these side effects are mild and temporary. Decreases in appetite can be improved by taking the medicines after meals or eating within 30 to 40 minutes after taking the medicine.</p><p>Serious side effects are rare. They may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular effects &ndash; Stimulants are not recommended for children with serious heart problems. There have been rare reports of serious side effects, including sudden unexpected death, in children taking stimulant medicines. However, it is not clear that the stimulant was the cause of death. Millions of children with ADHD have used stimulants and very few have had serious side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric effects &ndash; There have been a small number of reports of children who take stimulant medicines developing suicidal thinking, hallucinations, or aggressive behavior.</p><p/><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if you notice irritability, anxiety, panic, difficulty sleeping, hostility, suicidal thinking or behavior, or other unusual changes in behavior. The child should also see a doctor or nurse on a regular basis while taking stimulant medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulants are generally started at a low dose on the weekend so that parents can observe the child more closely. The dose and time the medicine is taken can be adjusted as needed (this is called &quot;titrating&quot; the dose).</p><p>The child may need to try more than one medicine or dose to find the one that works best and has the fewest side effects. Typically, only one stimulant is used at a time.</p><p>If the child needs to take medicine at school, he or she should have a separate bottle. A school nurse or faculty member should keep this medicine and give it to the child at the appropriate time. To avoid misuse and loss, the child should not keep the medicine in his or her school bag or desk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug holidays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;drug holiday&quot; is a time when medicine is not taken on the weekend or during school vacations. If you or your child is interested in trying a drug holiday, talk to the child's doctor or nurse.</p><p>Certain children can consider trying a drug holiday, including those who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only need ADHD treatment on school days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are having trouble with weight loss because of an ADHD medicine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Stopping stimulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The length of treatment with a stimulant medicine depends upon the child's situation. For some children with ADHD, it is reasonable to consider a trial period without medicine. Talk to your child's doctor or nurse about the risks and benefits of stopping treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ATOMOXETINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atomoxetine (brand name: Strattera) is a nonstimulant medicine used in the treatment of ADHD. It is more expensive than stimulant medicines. Atomoxetine is an alternative to stimulants that can be used in patients with a history of drug abuse or who have family members with a history of drug abuse. It can also be used if a child has intolerable side effects with stimulants.</p><p>Atomoxetine is usually taken once or twice per day and is available only in capsule form. Capsules should not be opened or chewed. Drug holidays are not recommended with atomoxetine.</p><p>Atomoxetine works as well as methylphenidate for treatment of ADHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of atomoxetine can include weight loss, decreased appetite, vomiting, nausea, upset stomach, and trouble sleeping. Severe liver injury has been reported in children and adults treated with atomoxetine. Call your child's doctor or nurse immediately if the child develops jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), which is a sign of liver injury.</p><p>There is also a small increased risk of suicidal thinking with atomoxetine, similar to stimulant medicines. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are other medicines available to treat ADHD if stimulants or atomoxetine do not work or have unacceptable side effects. A developmental behavioral pediatrician, child psychiatrist, or psychopharmacologist is usually consulted in these situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHD BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral treatments for ADHD include changes in a child's environment, which are designed to help the child change his or her behavior.</p><p>Behavioral treatments work to improve problems with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior and learning at school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationships with friends, parents, and siblings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following through with adult requests</p><p/><p>A professional training program is recommended for parents because it can be difficult to learn these techniques and use them effectively without support. Adults can help to shape the behavior of a child who has ADHD with the following techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow a daily schedule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep distractions to a minimum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide specific and logical places for the child to keep school work, toys, and clothes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set small, reachable, and clear goals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reward positive behavior (eg, a sticker chart with a bigger reward for a certain number of stickers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use charts and checklists to help the child stay &quot;on task&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest physical activity breaks during tasks that require attention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find activities where the child can be successful (eg, hobbies, sports)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use calm discipline (eg, time out, distraction, removing the child from the situation)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHD AND SCHOOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are diagnosed with ADHD may need changes in how they are taught, including extra help with school work during or after class. This extra help can be given in the classroom or in a &quot;resource&quot; room setting.</p><p>Other suggestions for teachers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Write homework assignments down (on paper or send by email)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have the child sit near the front of the classroom</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allow the child extra time to complete school work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the child a private signal when he or she is &quot;off-task&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a daily report card to help parents to monitor their child's symptoms and how well the current ADHD treatment plan is working</p><p/><p>Sometimes children with ADHD also have learning disabilities. If attention and behavior improve with treatment, but the child still struggles with specific types of school work (eg, reading comprehension or mathematics), he or she may need to be evaluated for a specific learning disability.</p><p>More information for teachers of children with ADHD is available through the <a href=\"http://www.chadd.org/Advocacy/Education.aspx&amp;token=D+wtiBdlrnFumH/0Q9HLABZ5si4tuB0iNvU/LJMw4pwzc82nPv1OnahCXa+szagBOV9BdtWGrwox1CtxgKSqmw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Resource Center on ADHD</a>.</p><p>ADHD is considered to be a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA [PL-101-476]). Under this act, children with ADHD may qualify for special education or related services. Alternatively, the child may qualify for changes in the regular classroom setting under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p><p>In addition, the Americans with Disabilities Act may provide individuals with ADHD reasonable accommodations in certain private schools and colleges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76196 \">table 1</a>).

They do not replace medical treatment but are offered to support the patient and family. Examples include massage, support groups, and biofeedback. Alternative treatments are treatments or products that are not considered to be part of conventional medicine. They usually are not reimbursed by insurance companies.</p><p>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies that have been tried for ADHD include vision training, special diets (eg, avoiding sugar, allergy triggers, or particular food additives), megavitamins, herbal and mineral supplements, electroencephalogram biofeedback, and applied kinesiology.</p><p>These treatments are often used by parents of children with ADHD because they may believe that these treatments &quot;are safer than traditional medicines,&quot; &quot;are natural,&quot; or &quot;can cure ADHD.&quot;</p><p>However, studies have not confirmed the benefits of these treatments, and the risks are not well understood. One significant risk is that the treatment will fail and cause a setback for the child if symptoms of ADHD continue. Another risk is that these treatments are expensive; CAM therapies are generally not covered by health insurance.</p><p>Any parent who is considering use of a CAM treatment should gather information about the safety, risks, and benefits of the treatment. You can find reliable information about alternative treatments from your child's health care team and the <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/&amp;token=xet4a8U02gaKYNXGdDyCVxMoXW/Ak4AwV+Aw+biWoFY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a>.</p><p>If you are considering a complementary or alternative treatment for your child, ask the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does it claim to cure ADHD and multiple other health problems? There is no known cure for ADHD, and no single treatment is likely to cure multiple health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does it claim to be harmless or natural? Natural does not necessarily mean safe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it offered by only one individual or is it a secret that only certain people can share? Reputable treatments that work well should be available from any licensed health care professional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it based on multiple studies that have been published? To confirm the safety and benefit of a treatment, multiple clinical studies should be published in mainstream medical journals (see <a href=\"http://www.pubmed.gov/&amp;token=QjQj5o0291Wf84PqNaVW8LC94WyqhJ5JJo91rRDbHdA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.pubmed.gov</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it expensive? Spending a large amount of money on a treatment that is not proven is risky.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the group or person promoting the CAM treatment an expert in ADHD treatment? Verify the education and licensing of any person who claims to be an expert. All states within the United States have a licensing board that can verify a person's credentials.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVING WITH ADHD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Other family members</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because ADHD is usually an inherited condition, parents and siblings of a child with ADHD could also have ADHD. Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if you should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-beyond-the-basics#H9\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Driving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents with untreated ADHD are two to four times more likely to have motor vehicle accidents than those without ADHD. They also are more likely to have their driver's license suspended or revoked.</p><p>As a result, parents of adolescents with ADHD should discuss the issues surrounding driving before the adolescent is licensed to drive. A longer period of supervision (eg, the adolescent drives with an adult) can help to ensure that the teen is able to use good judgment, can react quickly and carefully, and is safe to drive independently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Discussing medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you decide to use medicine to treat ADHD, you should discuss this decision with your child. This includes discussing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The purpose and expected benefits of the medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for the child to follow the rules and make good choices with the help of the medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible need to try more than one medicine or dose</p><p/><p>Diversion and misuse of stimulant medicines are common concerns of many parents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diversion is defined as giving, selling, or trading stimulants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misuse is defined as using a stimulant in higher-than-prescribed doses or in combination with illegal drugs or alcohol</p><p/><p>Ways to avoid these problems include using long-acting medicines, keeping track of prescription dates, and talking to the child about the possibility that friends or peers may ask them to divert or misuse medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Seek support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenting a child with ADHD can be emotionally and physically exhausting, and most parents need support to cope. Support can come from multiple resources, including family, friends, and support groups. There are a number of organizations that can provide information about parenting a child with ADHD.
