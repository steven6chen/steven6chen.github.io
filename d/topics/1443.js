However, in multicenter trials, <em>H. pylori </em>was absent in almost 30 percent of patients with an endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Studies that have investigated these patients found that they have generally had a shorter duration of symptoms and that many had regularly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Such patients have a significantly worse outcome, especially if treated empirically for <em>H. pylori </em>infection. Thus, <em>H. pylori </em>status should be determined in all ulcer patients before initiating treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. High acid output may be a cause of recurrent DU in patients in whom <em>H. pylori </em>has been eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A variety of other causes are responsible for the remaining cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unusual-causes-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unusual causes of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The link between <em>H. pylori </em>and DU will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology of <em>H. pylori </em>infection as it relates to gastrointestinal disease in general is discussed separately.

These data were supported by reports which found that the prevalence of <em>H. pylori </em>is negligible in populations in which ulcer disease is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The prevalence of <em>H. pylori </em>in patients with DU is changing in some parts of the world. While <em>H. pylori </em>infection remains very common in patients from Asia with DU, it is becoming less common in patients from the United States and parts of Europe. In an epidemiologic study from China, 1030 patients underwent endoscopy and 73 percent were found to have <em>H. pylori </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Peptic ulcers were present in 17 percent, more than two-thirds of which were duodenal ulcers. Among those with peptic ulcers, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori </em>infection was 93 percent. On the other hand, in the United States and parts of Europe, the prevalence of <em>H. pylori </em>in patients with ulcer disease appears to be falling and is now in the range of 50 to 75 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'H. pylori'</a>.)</p><p>While the association between <em>H. pylori </em>and DU is strong, it is not specific. As examples, <em>H. pylori </em>infection is also found in patients with gastric ulcers (65 to 95 percent), dyspepsia (20 to 60 percent), gastric cancer (70 to 90 percent), and asymptomatic patients (20 to 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

One study, for example, reviewed the cases of more than 5000 native Hawaiians who had stored serum from the late 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of the 65 patients who developed DU over the next 20 years, 92 percent were <em>H. pylori </em>positive versus 78 percent of controls, producing an odds ratio of 4.0. Similarly, an endoscopic study that included 526 patients with long-term follow-up found that the odds ratio of developing DU was 5.0 for those with preexisting <em>H. pylori </em>infection compared with <em>H. pylori-</em>negative subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Eradication of H. pylori reduces disease recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of <em>H. pylori </em>infection in patients with DU decreases the incidence of ulcer recurrence. One meta-analysis examined the recurrence rate for DU after at least six months of follow-up. The recurrence rate was 6 percent if <em>H. pylori </em>was eradicated and 67 percent if it was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A second meta-analysis found recurrence rates of 20 and 56 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The studies in the meta-analyses used endoscopic findings to define ulcer recurrence. It should be noted that the rate of symptomatic recurrence is lower.

However, the bacterium appears to affect the following aspects of intestinal and mucosal physiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased gastric acid secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric metaplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune response</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal defense mechanisms</p><p/><p>There may also be a contribution from a variety of bacterial, host, and environmental factors that have a role in the pathogenesis of ulcer formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73521\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73521 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased gastric acid secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute <em>H. pylori </em>infection induces a short period of hypochlorhydria. In contrast, chronic infection often leads to increases in basal and stimulated acid output, particularly in patients who develop DUs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54104 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, following <em>H. pylori </em>eradication, mean basal and stimulated acid output drops by 50 percent at one month and returns to normal levels by one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>One mechanism by which <em>H. pylori </em>may enhance gastric acid secretion is via increased release of gastrin. Gastrin is responsible for gastric acid secretion in normal subjects by two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has a trophic action on parietal cells and histamine-secreting enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It stimulates parietal cells largely via the release of histamine</p><p/><p>This process is tightly controlled by a second hormone, somatostatin, which is a potent inhibitor of gastrin synthesis, gastrin release, and gastric acid secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gastric-acid-secretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gastric acid secretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with <em>H. pylori </em>infection have elevated basal and stimulated concentrations of serum gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>] and a decreased concentration of somatostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The peak acid output achieved after stimulation with gastrin releasing peptide, regarded as a measure of the stomach's functional response to endogenous gastrin, is also increased threefold in healthy <em>H. pylori </em>positive patients, and sixfold in those with DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. These values completely normalize within one year of <em>H. pylori </em>eradication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54104 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The peak acid output after pentagastrin stimulation (PAOPg), a measure of the functional parietal cell population, is also significantly increased in <em>H. pylori</em>-associated DU disease. However, there are conflicting data regarding the effect of <em>H. pylori </em>eradication on PAOPg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21,22</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of the increased acid response in patients infected with <em>H. pylori </em>who have DU disease compared with infected healthy patients is unclear. One study suggests that it may be due to the combination of decreased sensitivity to gastrin in healthy patients, and increased maximal acid secretory capacity in those with DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Suppression of somatostatin (rather than an increase in gastrin-secreting cells) is probably the initial event that then leads to the hypergastrinemia that is evident in patients with DU and <em>H. pylori</em>. This hypothesis is supported by a study of 28 infected patients with DU that found that after the infection was successfully eradicated, the median density of somatostatin-immunoreactive cells (antral D cells) increased from 9 to 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm</span> muscularis mucosa, while the median somatostatin <span class=\"nowrap\">mRNA/rRNA</span> ratio increased from 50 to 95 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In contrast, the number of gastrin-immunoreactive cells and the quantity of gastrin mRNA did not change significantly. The role of <em>H. pylori </em>in this process is supported by studies that have shown eradication of infection reverses the abnormalities in gastrin and gastric acid secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54104 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, hypergastrinemia alone probably does not explain the increases in acid output in patients infected with <em>H. pylori</em>; gastrin levels often return to normal within one month after eradication, while mean basal and peak acid output remain elevated for longer periods of time. In addition, <em>H. pylori </em>itself does not appear to alter the sensitivity of gastric parietal cells to gastrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], although hypergastrinemia may have trophic effects over time that result in increased parietal cell mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric metaplasia refers to the presence of gastric epithelium in the first portion of the duodenum. This abnormality appears to be a response of the mucosa to excessive acid exposure since it only occurs when the luminal pH is less than 2.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition to acid hypersecretion, impaired duodenal bicarbonate secretion induced by <em>H. pylori </em>also may contribute to the low duodenal luminal pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The metaplastic foci provide areas for <em>H. pylori </em>colonization, and probably have a role in the development of duodenitis. In one study, for example, 30 of 34 (88 percent) patients with active duodenitis had more than 5 percent gastric metaplasia in duodenal mucosal specimens and <em>H. pylori</em>-associated gastritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast, these two factors coexisted in only 0.43 percent of patients with no duodenal inflammation. In addition, when <em>H. pylori </em>was seen histologically in duodenal biopsy specimens, it was confined only to areas of gastric metaplasia, and never occurred in the absence of a polymorphonuclear infiltrate. A more recent study confirmed that the extent of duodenal gastric metaplasia was fourfold greater in <em>H. pylori</em>-infected duodenal ulcer patients than in infected asymptomatic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Colonization of the duodenal bulb by <em>H. pylori </em>CagA+ strains was also greater in DU patients than in infected non DU controls (80 versus 30 percent), even though prevalence of CagA+ gastric infection was similar in both groups. These studies support the contention that infection of gastric metaplasia is important in the pathogenesis on DU.</p><p><em>H. pylori </em>infection in areas of gastric metaplasia may weaken the mucosa, making it more susceptible to acid injury. This hypothesis is supported by studies which have found that gastric metaplasia increases the relative risk for ulceration fivefold; the presence of <em>H. pylori </em>within these regions increases the risk 50-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Gastric metaplasia is not the same as gastric heterotopia, in which (presumably) congenital patches of gastric-type mucosa occur anywhere in the small or large intestine, although the two entities may be difficult to distinguish. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although <em>H. pylori </em>is a noninvasive organism, it stimulates a robust inflammatory and immune response that may have a role in DU formation. The response includes increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and most notably, IL-8. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucosal defense factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori </em>may downregulate several important mucosal defense factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) are potent gastric acid inhibitors and stimuli of mucosal growth and protection.

One such factor is the bacterial strain; only strains with the cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA), coding for a 128-140 kDa protein (CagA), coexpress vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA), a toxin that causes cell injury in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Approximately 85 to 100 percent of patients with DU have CagA+ strains, compared with 30 to 60 percent of infected patients who do not develop ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, since CagA+ strains are also associated with gastric cancer, the specificity of the association makes it less clear how the same strain can lead to two very divergent conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A specific<em> H. pylori </em>gene, dupA, appears to be associated with development of DU. Those infected with dupA bacteria had more intense antral inflammation, higher levels of IL-8 and less gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer, a cytokine and histologic profile associated with DU disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. One study suggested that the dupA gene, which encompasses jhp0917 and jhp0918, was associated with an increased risk of DU and protection against gastric cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In addition, genetic factors may help determine the susceptibility to infection with <em>H. pylori </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It has been suggested that patients with <em>H. pylori </em>who develop DU have an intrinsically higher parietal cell mass or sensitivity to gastrin than H. pylori-positive healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/23,29,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29,37</a>]. This observation may explain the exaggerated acid response to various stimuli in those who develop DUs. Genetic factors may also determine duodenal cytokine response to infection. In one study, duodenal epithelial cells from patients with a duodenal ulcer had a decreased capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines compared with controls from patients without a DU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Environmental factors such as smoking and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use may also increase the risk of ulcer formation in patients with <em>H. pylori </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/31,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39-41</a>].

Other causes for <em>H. pylori-</em>negative DUs were much less common.</p><p>NSAID users with a history of peptic ulcer disease should be tested and treated for <em>H. pylori </em>if they are infected; there are also data to suggest that testing and treating (if positive) all patients for <em>H. pylori </em>prior to beginning NSAID use may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], although conflicting data have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-duodenal-ulcer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and this is not currently the standard of care.
