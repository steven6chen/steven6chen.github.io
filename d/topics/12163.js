They are typically slow-growing neoplasms that occur mainly in children, with 90 percent diagnosed before the age of 20 and 75 percent before the age of 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPGs are classified by anatomic location and by whether or not they are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, von Recklinghausen's disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-grade gliomas may involve the anterior visual pathway of the optic nerve (25 to 35 percent of cases) or the posterior visual pathways (chiasmal and postchiasmal).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior visual pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior tumors can be subdivided into orbital, intracanalicular, and intracranial prechiasmal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These tumors occur most frequently in prepubertal children, and most are classified as pilocytic astrocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tumor may appear either as an infiltrative lesion or one that is sharply demarcated from the normal optic nerve. Invasion of the leptomeninges or a dense fibroblastic reaction is frequently seen. As the tumor progresses, it compresses the optic nerve. As a result, the optic nerve becomes demyelinated and optic atrophy develops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior visual pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior tumors may arise in the optic chiasm, hypothalamus, or anterior third ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Chiasmal and hypothalamic lesions present at a mean age of approximately three years. Histologically, these are typically pilocytic astrocytomas. Occasionally, gangliogliomas occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with neurofibromatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPGs are the most common central nervous system tumors associated with NF1. If all children underwent screening, estimates indicate that OPGs would be found in 15 percent of those with NF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. NF1 tumors more commonly involve the anterior visual pathway, while tumors in NF1-negative children are more frequent in the posterior visual pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. OPGs have also been described in patients with NF2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The natural history and clinical presentation of OPGs in patients with NF1, along with the potential role of screening are discussed separately.

For this reason, it had been suggested that some OPGs may be hamartomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, most evidence supports their designation as true, slow-growing neoplasms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OPGs are virtually identical histologically to pilocytic astrocytomas seen elsewhere in the nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas often have a tandem duplication of chromosome 7q34 and associated <em>BRAF-KIAA</em> fusion gene, which may eventually provide opportunities for targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

As an example, loss of chromosome 17q (the location of the neurofibromatosis type 1 [<em>NF1</em>] gene) is demonstrable in some cases, even in patients without NF1 or NF2, suggesting some link between this gene and tumor development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>BRAF</em> duplications have been identified in approximately 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OPGs in patients with NF1 exhibit a characteristic loss of neurofibromin (which functions as a negative growth regulator for astrocytes) and increased RAS activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of OPGs usually develop over a course of months to years and depend upon the location of the tumor.</p><p>Orbital tumors most often present with proptosis; less frequent findings are strabismus and symptoms similar or identical to spasmus nutans (pendular or dysconjugate nystagmus, torticollis, and head bobbing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Unilateral visual impairment is a relatively uncommon presenting symptom, possibly due to the young age of these patients at presentation. Funduscopic examination may show edema of the optic disc <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pallor due to atrophy.</p><p>Chiasmal and hypothalamic gliomas often present as large masses even though they are typically well differentiated and low grade (most often pilocytic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/2,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,22</a>]. In patients with chiasmal lesions, the chief complaint is usually impaired vision. Obstructive hydrocephalus also may be noted at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>]. The diencephalic syndrome, manifested by progressive emaciation and failure to thrive in an apparently alert, cheerful infant, can be seen with hypothalamic gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poor weight gain in children older than two years of age&quot;, section on 'Increased needs'</a>.)</p><p>Endocrinopathies due to hypothalamic extension are present in 10 to 20 percent of patients with OPGs. The most frequent is precocious puberty due to involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; this occurs in up to 39 percent of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and chiasmal OPGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, all children with chiasmal tumors should be screened for endocrine abnormalities.</p><p>The primary presenting symptoms tend to be different in patients with and without NF1. While patients with sporadic OPG are more likely to present with signs of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus, those with NF1-associated OPGs are more likely to present with precocious puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of OPG should be considered in any child presenting with unexplained visual loss, monocular or asymmetric nystagmus, a diencephalic syndrome, or optic atrophy.</p><p>The diagnosis is best made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allows visualization of the entire course of the optic nerve. MRI also delineates hypothalamic involvement more clearly than computed tomography (CT). However, CT is superior for bone detail and detection of intratumoral calcifications, which suggest low grade histology.</p><p>Three typical patterns are seen on neuroimaging studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100713\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100713 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubular thickening of the optic nerve and chiasm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suprasellar tumor with contiguous optic nerve expansion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suprasellar tumor with optic tract involvement</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of tumors in the region of the hypothalamus includes suprasellar germinoma, craniopharyngioma, glioma, and infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or Langerhans histiocytosis. Cyst formation is unusual in optic gliomas but may be seen with cases exhibiting extension into the hypothalamic regions. The presence of a cyst within a suprasellar mass is more suggestive but not diagnostic of craniopharyngioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniopharyngioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniopharyngioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Suprasellar masses without apparent optic nerve extension or optic tract involvement are less likely to be OPGs, and biopsy may be required for diagnosis. Although some experts advocate biopsy of any lesion in the suprasellar region, we recommend that a biopsy be obtained if the lesion does not appear vascular, and there is no apparent primary tumor from which the lesion could have metastasized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical behavior of OPGs is unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Spontaneous regression, malignant degeneration, and metastatic dissemination through ventriculoperitoneal shunts have all been reported. In children, the variable clinical course is more a function of location than specific histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>]. In adults, by contrast, OPGs tend to be histologically anaplastic, displaying aggressive clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial and intraorbital tumors of the optic nerve have an excellent prognosis in children with a median survival of more than 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 5 percent of optic nerve gliomas invade the optic chiasm; locally invasive recurrence can also develop following complete intraorbital excision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcome for patients with chiasmal and postchiasmal gliomas is usually less favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, some children with chiasmal gliomas may survive for long periods without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/11,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,37</a>], and cases of spontaneous regression have been reported, all in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OPGs associated with NF1 tend to have a better prognosis, at least in part due to the predominance of anterior lesions. However, compared with patients without NF1, those with NF1 have approximately twice the recurrence rate following complete excision of an intraorbital glioma, but a similar prognosis following radiation of a chiasmal glioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/8,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,42</a>].</p><p/><p>Even with prolonged survival, however, many patients have significant long-term visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/36,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,43-45</a>]. In a retrospective study of 59 children with sporadic OPGs (median age at diagnosis 2.5 years), 45 percent of patients had <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> vision or worse in their best eye at a median follow-up of 5.2 years, including 15 patients (25 percent) with severe bilateral vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Although the prognosis for survival may be better in NF1 patients with OPGs, significant visual impairment is frequent, and it is unclear whether treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation improves the prognosis for retaining vision in these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>In contrast to children, the clinical course of an OPG in an adult resembles the behavior of the tumor's histology, which is more commonly a malignant glioma. In adults, malignant OPGs can result in rapidly progressive visual loss, and middle-aged or older adults may present with the rapid onset of blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. Tumor invasion into adjacent brain may then become apparent, leading to death within a few months of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Standard radiotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy of these lesions typically leads to disappointing results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal management of OPGs is controversial. Treatment decisions should take into account the patient's age, the presence or absence of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and the location of the tumor. A multidisciplinary approach is strongly recommended with close consultations with the ophthalmologist, radiation oncologist, pediatric oncologist, neuroradiologist, and neurosurgeon.</p><p>If possible, a period of observation should precede treatment initiation in young patients and those with NF1. Tumor size and visual function should be closely monitored both clinically and by serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); an untoward change in either clinical status or size on imaging may signal the need for active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/31,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,53</a>]. Adults should be managed aggressively, as dictated by pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Optic nerve tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation without specific treatment is appropriate for tumors that exclusively involve the optic nerve until there is evidence of either extension into the optic canal or progressive visual compromise. In patients with symptoms due to visual loss or abnormal eye movements, serial neuroophthalmologic examinations and MRI scans can be used to assess tumor progression. </p><p>A minority of children with isolated intraorbital gliomas and NF1 will experience tumor progression within 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/7,8,27,41,43,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,27,41,43,54,55</a>]. Chemotherapy is usually the first choice in this situation. If there is progression associated with proptosis and a significant cosmetic problem, and there is poor or no vision in that eye, then surgery should be considered; however, surgery invariably results in complete loss of vision in the involved eye. Radiation therapy (RT) is generally avoided in children with NF1 due to an increased risk of secondary malignancy and other sequelae.</p><p>In a child without NF1, RT may be considered if there is progressive visual loss or radiographic progression after a trial of chemotherapy. Radiation may prove useful to save, and at times improve, vision in an eye that has not lost vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Upon further evidence of progression, amputation of the nerve within the orbit may be considered. It has been recommended that resection be performed flush with the chiasm to prevent centripetal extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, there are few data supporting this concept.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive imaging studies are not able to reliably differentiate OPGs from other lesions that may require different therapy (eg, craniopharyngiomas, germinomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For this reason, a pathologic diagnosis should be established in all cases of pediatric diencephalic tumors except for those patients with NF1, in whom the diagnosis of an OPG is virtually certain. Biopsy of small lesions should be carried out carefully, so that remaining vision is not jeopardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Following diagnosis, patients can be managed with observation, tumor resection, radiotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy. Although these treatments may improve tumor-related symptoms, there is no evidence that any routine intervention enhances long-term survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular shunting is indicated when an OPG is causing obstructive hydrocephalus. However, the role of radical resection in other settings is controversial.</p><p>Traditionally, patients with OPGs have been treated nonsurgically or with conservative surgical approaches due to perceived morbidity and the uncertain influence of surgical treatment on outcome. A retrospective series examined conservative surgical strategies in 33 patients with OPGs who would have been considered eligible for radical surgery in many centers today, but who were treated with no surgery, with conservative surgery (&lt;50 percent resection), or with biopsy alone, followed by adjuvant therapy with radiation (29 patients) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy (18 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. After a mean follow-up of eleven years, only five of these conservatively treated patients had died (three of tumor progression, one of acute shunt malfunction, and one of intercurrent infection). Twenty-three surviving patients had functional vision in at least one eye, 12 required no endocrine replacement, and 16 were capable of meeting standard academic requirements.</p><p>There may however be benefits to radical resection other than prolongation of survival. These include a delay in the time to disease progression in older children and a delay in the need for RT in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 45 patients with extensive gliomas of the chiasm and third ventricle, 77 percent experienced stabilization or improvement in visual function after radical resection.

Despite this, the survival rate after 20 years is equivalent to that in patients who have not received radiation. There is also no clear evidence that earlier intervention for chiasmal OPGs changes prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, external beam radiation (&gt;45 Gy) has been used in patients with progressive tumor to diminish tumor bulk, decrease recurrence rates, prolong recurrence-free survival, reverse the diencephalic syndrome, and improve vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/1,2,23,62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23,62-66</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT can arrest progressive visual and neurologic impairment, although the maximal effect can take years to be observed.

These radiation-induced complications have led to the use of chemotherapy as the initial treatment, so that RT can be deferred as long as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/54,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,68</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;, section on 'Long-term morbidity'</a> and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Occlusive vascular disease, angiographically similar to moyamoya disease, and usually presenting with ischemic stroke, can also occur following radiation for a chiasmal tumor, particularly in patients with NF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moyamoya disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one retrospective study of 47 patients treated for optic glioma, moyamoya disease developed in 5 of 28 patients treated with radiation (including three of five patients with NF1) compared with none of 19 who did not receive radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. A second series documented occlusive vasculopathy in 13 of 69 children with OPGs, at a median of 36 months after radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The major risk factor was NF1.</p><p>In addition, malignant gliomas can develop in previously irradiated fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/59,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,72,73</a>]. The use of RT in NF1 patients is of particular concern because of the development of second primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In an observational series of 58 patients, 9 of 18 patients (50 percent) developed one or more additional nervous system tumors, and five of these died as a result of the second tumor. By contrast, 8 of 40 (20 percent) patients who were not irradiated for their OPGs developed second nervous system tumors, and no deaths were observed. A more contemporary study reported a threefold increased risk of second nervous system tumors in patients who received RT compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Newer RT techniques (eg, proton beam irradiation and stereotactic radiotherapy) may provide adequate tumor control while decreasing treatment-related morbidity. As an example, one study compared proton beam, three-dimensional (3D) photon, and lateral photon radiation treatment plans based on the same computed tomography (CT) data sets in seven children with OPGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. When the normal organs at risk for toxicity were studied based upon these models, proton beam therapy reduced the dose to the contralateral optic nerve by 47 and 77 percent compared with 3D photons and lateral photons, respectively. Reductions were also seen for the chiasm (11 and 16 percent, respectively) and pituitary gland (13 and 16 percent, respectively). These differences were all at clinically relevant tolerance levels. Furthermore, proton beam therapy was associated with reduced exposure of both temporal lobes and the frontal lobes. Further experience is needed with proton beam therapy to know whether this approach improves long-term outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the benign histologic appearance of many OPGs, chemotherapy results in surprisingly high response rates. For this reason, chemotherapy is often preferred as initial treatment rather than radiation, especially in children less than age five years, for whom there is a high likelihood of deleterious effects on cognitive function with other treatment modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/43,75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,75-79</a>]. The use of chemotherapy can often postpone the need for radiation, a delay that may reduce neurocognitive morbidity without compromising survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/43,80-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,80-83</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of this approach in deferring RT was illustrated in a multicenter study of 85 children with progressive OPGs (median age 33 months) who received chemotherapy with alternating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>,</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a></span> every three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This chemotherapy-first approach was successful in avoiding the use of RT in children in 75 and 61 percent of children at three and five years, respectively. The median interval between the start of therapy and the need for radiation in the 25 children in whom it was delivered was 35 months. Delaying radiation did not jeopardize outcomes; the 89 percent overall survival rate at five years is comparable to that achieved with initial irradiation, and visual outcomes were not dissimilar.</p><p>Between 40 and 60 percent of patients eventually progress after chemotherapy and require further therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/43,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,80,81</a>]. Patients who have OPGs in the setting of NF1 often have indolent disease, and fewer require subsequent therapy.</p><p>Various combination chemotherapy regimens have been used to treat these tumors. Combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> and actinomycin D, vincristine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or carboplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, or a nitrosourea-based combination regimen are most frequently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/75-77,80,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77,80,84,85</a>]. The following describes the range of findings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 78 children with newly diagnosed, progressive low-grade gliomas, including 58 with diencephalic tumors, were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-pathway-glioma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Forty-four (56 percent) patients had an objective response to treatment, and the progression-free survival rate at three years was 68 percent.
