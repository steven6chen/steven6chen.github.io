Marked fatigue, one of the common manifestations of the primary infection, may be especially prolonged and slow to resolve. </p><p>Whether or not the primary exposure is recognized, most infections are self-limited without additional events or complications. However, occasional patients have persistent pulmonary consequences of coccidioidomycosis that require medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical management. These include residual pulmonary nodules, coccidioidal cavities, and diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and management of these sequelae will be reviewed here. Primary and disseminated coccidioidomycosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESIDUAL PULMONARY NODULES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 4 percent of patients with primary coccidioidal pneumonia, infiltrates do not completely resolve and radiographic findings may persist for months to years following the disappearance of symptoms. These pulmonary nodules range up to several centimeters in diameter, are often solitary, and are frequently located in the periphery of the lung, close to or abutting the pleura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1864629023\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A residual nodule usually poses no problems and requires no treatment if it is known to be the consequence of an initial coccidioidal infection. However, in many cases, coccidioidal nodules are discovered incidentally and can be difficult to distinguish from malignancy. </p><p>Testing to differentiate a residual nodule versus malignancy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional radiographic imaging &ndash; If residual pulmonary nodules are discovered incidentally, prior chest x-rays should be obtained to look for a previously detected lesion to assess stability. In addition, uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose by positron emission tomography with computed axial tomography may note a lower uptake in granulomatous versus malignant lesions; however, there can be considerable overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serology &ndash; Testing for anti-coccidioidal antibodies can be useful. A positive result suggests that the lung lesion represents coccidioidomycosis since these tests become negative in most patients whose pulmonary lesions completely resolve. However, standard tests for anti-coccidioidal antibodies are negative in more than 65 percent of patients with coccidioidal nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Percutaneous aspiration of coccidioidal pulmonary nodules does not pose a significant risk of creating a granulomatous track to the skin or reactivating clinical disease within the lesion. </p><p>If such procedures are not possible or are unsuccessful, then the nodule should be surgically resected in order to perform histopathological examination, including stains for fungal organisms and culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77193%7EPULM%2F64404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77193 graphicRef64404 \">picture 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75250%7EID%2F55301%7EID%2F68068\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75250 graphicRef55301 graphicRef68068 \">picture 2A-C</a>). Resection of nodules can most often be accomplished by a minimally invasive approach using thoracoscopy and typically involves en bloc resection of the lesion and margin of normal lung. The thoracoscopic approach has a low morbidity and short hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This may lead to formation of a local abscess or fistula. Although there are no published data on how to manage incomplete resection, one approach is to treat the patient postoperatively with an oral antifungal agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg once daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (200 mg twice daily) for three to six months to reduce the chances of local complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If local complications occur, amphotericin B, with or without local debridement, is reasonable. Optimal management may require consultation with infectious disease specialists and thoracic surgeons familiar with this problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COCCIDIOIDAL CAVITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary sequelae of primary coccidioidal infection includes the development of cavities. Cavities occur in approximately 2 to 8 percent of coccidioidal infections in adults but are rare in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Half of these cavities will resolve within the first two years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thin-walled cavities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inflammatory pulmonary process that develops during the initial coccidioidal infection results in areas of infarction that leads to cavitation in some patients. A cavity can also occur when a previously stable coccidioidal nodule liquefies and erodes into a bronchiole. These cavities often have the same dimensions as the original nodule. </p><p>Residual cavities are commonly solitary and peripheral in location on chest x-ray. Their walls are often thin with little or no discernible surrounding infiltrate. In the absence of symptoms, treatment is not recommended. Since it is possible for coccidioidal cavities to change appearance, repeat chest x-rays at intervals ranging from six months to two years are helpful to determine whether the lesion is enlarging or regressing. Sequential posterior-anterior and lateral chest x-rays are often sufficient for assessment without the need for multiple computed tomography (CT) scans. </p><p>The management of thin-walled cavities depends upon the host and the presence or absence of symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not administer antifungal therapy to immunocompetent patients who are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such patients should be monitored periodically (every one to two years) to evaluate the size of the lesion and the presence of other complications, such as bacterial or fungal superinfection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop symptoms such as pleural discomfort and hemoptysis, as well as those who are immunocompromised, should be treated with oral antifungal agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>) for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<strong> </strong>If symptoms recur after stopping, subsequent retreatment for longer periods or even indefinitely might be needed. </p><p/><p>Surgical resection is rarely indicated because of the efficacy of oral azoles. However, resection is reasonable for young, otherwise healthy patients whose symptoms persist or recur after a two-year trial of azoles, as well as those who have cavity growth despite antifungal treatment. </p><p>Although surgical resection may be curative, it can be technically difficult. If the lesion is peripheral, there are often extensive adhesions within the pleura. More central and more acutely inflamed lesions will have a significant area of inflamed lung surrounding the cavity, which is generally underappreciated on CT scan. This often mandates large wedge resections and even lobectomy to obtain an adequate margin to allow stapling in an area of relatively normal parenchyma. Careful attention must be paid not to enter or rupture the cavity since this can lead to spread throughout the pleural space and possible empyema. In general, minimally invasive surgery is an option for these more complicated resections, although the experience of the surgeon is an important consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ruptured cavities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite their frequent proximity to the pleura, it is rare for coccidioidal cavities to rupture out into the pleural space. When rupture does occur, a bronchopleural fistula and contamination of the plural space occurs. Dyspnea and chest pain are the most common manifestations. Ruptured coccidioidal cavities are most frequent in young, otherwise healthy, athletic males and are not associated with immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In approximately half of patients, symptoms associated with rupture are the first symptoms of the coccidioidal infection. A pneumothorax with associated <span class=\"nowrap\">effusion/air-fluid</span> level is frequently seen on upright chest imaging and is useful to distinguish this problem from a spontaneous pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a ruptured coccidioidal cavity is diagnosed, the preferred therapy is prompt decortication and surgical resection of the cavity. More proximally located cavities may require a lobectomy due to the surrounding inflammation, and decortication to facilitate re-expansion of the remaining lung. Oral antifungal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg daily) is commonly administered in conjunction with the surgery, but is likely the minor part of management if the surgery is successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>If the diagnosis is delayed for one week or more, the morbidity and mortality of the rupture and the interventions increase significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Surgical repair becomes a greater technical challenge with delayed diagnosis and resection may not be possible due to inflammation and infection. In this case, consideration should be given to decortication without attempt at resection, accepting the need for longer term chest tubes. With oral antifungal therapy, many cavities will respond to the point that the air leak resolves and chest tubes can be removed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic fibrocavitary pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, primary coccidioidal pneumonia does not resolve and evolves into a chronic pulmonary process. Diabetic and immunocompromised patients are significantly more likely to develop this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Chronic coccidioidal infections can cause constitutional symptoms (night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local symptoms (chest pain, hemoptysis, sputum production, shortness of breath). Chest radiography usually shows complex mixtures of infiltrates and cavitation, and hilar adenopathy is common.</p><p>Most patients with chronic fibrocavitary pneumonia require treatment, usually with oral antifungal azoles for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A randomized trial of 198 patients with chronic pulmonary, soft tissue, or skeletal coccidioidal infections directly compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg PO once daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (200 mg PO twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The two drugs were equivalent in the overall analysis and in the subset with chronic pulmonary infections (eg, response in 63 and 66 percent at 12 months).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Posaconazole</a> has been less well studied but has shown promise in a small open-label trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and as salvage therapy in patients with chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A small retrospective study of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or posaconazole for the treatment of refractory coccidioidomycosis found that many (but not all) patients treated with one of these agents experienced improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Amphotericin B can be used for refractory infections.

A similar radiographic appearance can be seen after inhalational exposure to a high density of fungal spores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; however, such patients are typically not immunocompromised.</p><p>Patients with diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia from coccidioidomycosis are often markedly dyspneic at rest or with minimal exertion. Associated symptoms frequently include fever and night sweats over a period of several days to weeks.</p><p>Because of the extent of lung involvement, aggressive diagnostic measures are often pursued early. Specimens of bronchoalveolar washings stained for either cytologic examination or fungal organisms may reveal spherules of <em>Coccidioides</em> spp. Fungal cultures of such material are more sensitive but may take several days before growth is evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Serologic evidence of infection may also be helpful but can be negative in as many as one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A small number of patients have been identified with diffuse coccidioidal pneumonia that, over a period of years, extends over progressively larger portions of the lung, despite aggressive antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One feature that is strikingly different in these patients compared with other patients is the lack of cavitation despite the extent of lung involvement. In two such patients, a mutation in STAT1 has been identified that is likely responsible.</p><p>For patients with diffuse reticulonodular coccidioidal pneumonia, we typically initiate intravenous amphotericin B (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> [3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day]</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> [5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day])</span>. Although there are no comparative studies to indicate whether amphotericin B is more effective than oral azole therapy, some authorities believe that the onset of action of amphotericin B may be faster, and thus preferable, for initial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of amphotericin B&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An increasingly used strategy is to change therapy following clinical improvement from amphotericin B to an oral azole. Azole therapy is usually continued for at least one year and indefinitely in patients with ongoing immunodeficiency.</p><p>The treatment approach is the same in immunocompetent patients who have diffuse reticulonodular coccidioidal pneumonia as a result of an inhalational exposure, except that the transition to oral azole therapy may occur sooner and the duration of treatment is shorter compared with patients who develop disease following hematogenous spread. In such patients, treatment can generally be stopped after a minimum of one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The occasional pulmonary consequences of coccidioidomycosis include residual pulmonary nodules, coccidioidal cavities, chronic and progressive fibrocavitary pneumonia, and diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual pulmonary nodules usually have no clinical consequences and require no treatment. If residual pulmonary nodules are discovered incidentally, prior chest x-rays should be obtained to look for a previously detected lesion to assess stability, and serologies for anti-coccidioidal antibodies should be sent. If malignancy cannot be excluded, the nodule should be sampled for histopathological examination and culture. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Residual pulmonary nodules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual thin-walled cavities are typically asymptomatic and require no treatment. Periodic imaging may be used to monitor residual cavities. Treatment is generally initiated if symptoms, such as pleural discomfort and hemoptysis, occur. Such symptoms often improve when treated with oral antifungal agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>), but relapse may be seen when treatment is discontinued. Surgical resection may be necessary in patients whose symptoms persist or recur after a two-year trial of azoles, as well as in those who have cavity growth despite antifungal treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Thin-walled cavities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cavity ruptures, a bronchopleural fistula and pleural contamination results. If promptly diagnosed, surgical resection of the cavity is the preferred approach. If the diagnosis is delayed for one week or more, surgical resection becomes increasingly challenging with a much higher risk of complications; decortication without resection but with long-term chest tubes should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ruptured cavities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop chronic fibrocavitary pneumonia, we treat with oral antifungal azoles for at least one year. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> (400 mg once daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (200 mg twice daily) appear to be equivalent in efficacy. Amphotericin B can be used for refractory infections unresponsive to oral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chronic fibrocavitary pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia most often results from fungemia in patients with cellular immune deficiency. For such patients, we initiate treatment with amphotericin B and, following clinical improvement, switch to oral azole therapy and continue this indefinitely. Occasionally, diffuse reticulonodular pneumonia can occur in an immunocompetent host after exposure to a high density of fungal spores. The treatment approach is the same as in those with disease due to hematogenous spread, except that the transition to oral azole therapy can occur earlier and the treatment can generally be stopped after a minimum of one year.
