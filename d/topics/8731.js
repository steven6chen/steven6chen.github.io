Infection in these patients results in excessive morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial therapy is often less effective than in the immunocompetent host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many immunocompromised patients are unable to mount protective immune responses. Furthermore, immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated vaccine strains and is therefore generally avoided in solid organ transplant recipients.</p><p>The rationale for immunizing patients who are awaiting or have undergone solid organ transplantation will be reviewed here. Issues related to immunizations in patients who have had hematopoietic cell transplants, who have undergone chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies or solid tumors, who have HIV infection, and in healthy adults are discussed separately.

The factors contributing to immunosuppression in this setting include the underlying disease (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency), the presence of allograft rejection, and the immunosuppressive therapy administered after transplantation.</p><p>Although certain vaccines provide some benefit to the immunocompromised patient, an adequate vaccine response cannot be assumed. Protection of the immunocompromised patient may require the use of vaccines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> passive immunization (ie, intravenous immunoglobulin) as well as adjunctive measures, such as antiviral drug prophylaxis during influenza A outbreaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220176207\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2013, the American Society of Transplantation (AST) updated the guidelines for vaccination of pediatric and adult solid organ transplant candidates and recipients as well as healthcare workers, household contacts, and other close contacts of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Also in 2013, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised hosts, including solid organ transplant recipients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also includes immunocompromised hosts in their recommendations.</p><p>Our recommendations are generally in keeping with the AST guidelines, the IDSA guidelines, and the ACIP recommendations. Clinicians in other countries should refer to their national guidelines for recommendations regarding immunization of solid organ transplant candidates and recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF IMMUNIZATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113799911\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretransplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solid organ transplant candidates often have to wait unpredictable periods before a suitable donor is available. This waiting period should be used to maintain or boost antibody concentrations for all age-, exposure history&ndash;, and immune status&ndash;appropriate vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Standard vaccines for children are summarized in the following figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82617 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58209\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58209 \">figure 2</a>). Standard vaccines for adults with medical conditions are summarized in the following figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 3</a>).

Since vaccine immunogenicity is often diminished in the setting of organ failure, transplant candidates should be immunized as early in the course of their disease as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Other reasons to immunize patients before transplantation include the fact that live virus vaccines (eg, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, zoster, and the intranasal influenza vaccine) are usually avoided posttransplant. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends waiting a minimum of four weeks between live virus vaccine administration and transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113799917\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttransplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important issue is the optimal timing to resume immunization following solid organ transplantation. Although it has not been clearly defined, many transplant centers wait at least two months after transplantation before giving immunizations to avoid the effects of high doses of antirejection medications on blunting the immune response to vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is common to wait three to six months after transplantation before giving vaccines, once maintenance immunosuppression levels have been attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An exception is that during influenza outbreaks, it is reasonable to give the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> as early as one month following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Standard age-appropriate vaccines as well as vaccines indicated for immunocompromised hosts (eg, pneumococcal vaccines in adults) should be administered two to six months following transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Some transplant physicians avoid all immunizations following solid organ transplantation, based on case reports of allograft rejection following immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, multiple studies have shown the safety of inactivated vaccinations following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>].

However, this has not been substantiated by clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis immunizations should be kept up to date throughout adult life, regardless of transplantation status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Td</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of published information on the response of both transplant candidates and recipients to tetanus and diphtheria immunizations (Td) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Hemodialysis patients appear to have an impaired response to primary immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In one series, all 164 renal transplant recipients immunized with tetanus toxoid 1 to 24 months (median 7 months) after transplantation developed protective tetanus titers that remained protective for at least 1 year after immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although 89 percent of these patients also developed protective <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-antitoxin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphtheria antitoxin</a> levels, 38 percent had titers that were no longer protective at 1 year. None of these patients had an episode of rejection and the estimated glomerular filtration rate remained stable after immunization.</p><p>Another study evaluated responses to a Td booster in 42 pediatric renal transplant recipients who were immunized against tetanus and diphtheria prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Protective antibodies against diphtheria were observed in 38 percent and against tetanus in 90 percent prior to receiving the booster. Following booster immunization, 95 percent had protective antibodies against diphtheria at 1 month and 76 percent at 12 months. Protection against tetanus occurred and persisted for the duration of the study in all patients following the booster. No change in allograft function was seen following vaccine administration.</p><p>Based upon these studies, immunization against tetanus and diphtheria after transplantation is considered safe. Diphtheria immunization does not produce a durable response in many solid organ transplant recipients; ideally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-antitoxin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphtheria antitoxin</a> titers would be checked one year after immunization and a booster dose would be administered if the levels are not protective (&lt;0.1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. However, in practice this is rarely done, and the 2013 American Society of Transplantation (AST) guidelines do not recommend checking diphtheria titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The AST guidelines recommend monitoring tetanus titers in pediatric (but not adult) solid organ transplant candidates and recipients a minimum of four weeks following vaccination.</p><p>Routine booster doses should also be administered at least every 10 years, according to standard recommendations.

As noted above, vaccination is typically resumed at approximately three to six months after transplantation, once maintenance immunosuppression levels have been attained. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have recommended that all patients, including transplant recipients, be immunized prior to discharge from the hospital. This may result in some patients being immunized very early following transplantation and suboptimal immune responses to the vaccine. Revaccination of such patients three to six months following transplantation can be considered if there is still influenza activity.

Ideally, these standard immunization protocols will be used concurrently as new immunosuppressive agents are tested in phase III clinical trials so that vaccine response and safety can be evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNIZATIONS IN TRAVELERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunizations in travelers are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunizations should be administered to solid organ transplant candidates as early as possible in the transplant evaluation in order to optimize immune responses and provide immunity to pathogens against which there is only a live vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, zoster). We recommend waiting a minimum of four weeks between live virus vaccine administration and transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Timing of immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard age-appropriate vaccines, as well as vaccines indicated for immunocompromised hosts (eg, pneumococcal vaccines in adults), should be administered two to six months following transplantation, once maintenance immunosuppression levels have been attained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Timing of immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivated vaccines are generally considered to be safe following solid organ transplantation. Although efficacy may be suboptimal, we recommend that inactivated vaccines be administered to solid organ transplant candidates and recipients according to the usual schedules (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Inactivated vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, we recommend that solid organ transplant candidates and recipients be vaccinated against pneumococcus with both the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pneumococcus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> using live vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, zoster, intranasal influenza vaccine) in the majority of solid organ transplant recipients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). An exception is varicella-nonimmune pediatric renal or liver transplant recipients who are receiving minimal or no immunosuppression and who have had no recent allograft rejection; such individuals may receive the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Live virus vaccines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Varicella'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is considered safe in household contacts of solid organ transplant recipients. The use of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> in household contacts is a matter of debate. We suggest administering the varicella vaccine to nonimmune household contacts (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest that the zoster vaccine be administered to household contacts when indicated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Vaccinees who develop a rash should avoid contact with transplant recipients for the duration of the rash.
