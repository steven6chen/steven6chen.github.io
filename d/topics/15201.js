Numerous risk factors for asthma have been identified. The best studied risk factors, including gender, airway hyperreactivity, atopy, allergens, infections, tobacco smoke, obesity, and perinatal factors, are discussed in this topic review.</p><p>The epidemiology and natural history of asthma are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are clear-cut gender differences in the prevalence of asthma. Childhood asthma tends to be a predominantly male disease, with the relative male predominance being maximal at puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After age 20, the prevalence remains approximately equal until age 40, when the disease becomes more common in females. Reasons for gender differences are unclear and largely unexplored. Possible explanations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greater prevalence of atopy (ie, evidence of IgE sensitization to allergens) in young boys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced relative airway size in boys compared to girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Smaller airway size may also contribute to the increased risk of wheezing after viral respiratory infections in young boys compared to girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in symptom reporting between boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY ABNORMALITIES IN PULMONARY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be changes in lung function that are present in childhood or even in neonatal life in individuals who subsequently develop symptoms of asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal lung function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence for the presence of physiologic differences shortly after birth in individuals who later develop asthma. Lung function in neonates can be measured non-invasively using tidal breathing flow-volume loops and passive respiratory mechanics. Using these methods, a prospective birth cohort of 802 healthy infants underwent pulmonary function testing at an average of three days of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ten years later, 77 percent were contacted and reevaluated for the presence of asthma by history, standard lung function testing, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (treadmill testing), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge, and skin prick testing for allergic sensitization to aeroallergens. There were statistically significant associations between values for pulmonary function testing below the median for the cohort and the presence of asthma at 10 years with odds ratios between 1.58 and 2.18, depending on the measurement examined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway hyperreactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal and exaggerated airway responsiveness to noxious stimuli is a central feature in the pathophysiology of asthma, and all patients with asthma have airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) by definition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, not all patients with AHR have symptoms of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Population-based studies of both adults and children have shown that the prevalence of asthma is two to three times lower than the prevalence of AHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Moreover, 20 to 50 percent of subjects with airway hyperresponsiveness are asymptomatic at the time of testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations indicate that asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness are not identical phenomena. Airway hyperresponsiveness appears to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the development of clinical disease. Furthermore, patients with AHR are at increased risk for the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>One study in adolescents demonstrated that AHR frequently antedates and is associated with an elevated risk for wheeze onset and recurrent asthma, even after controlling for a variety of known risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This study investigated 281 children, aged five to nine years at the time of entry into the study, and followed voluntarily with airway challenges for up to six years. In a logistic regression model, the odds ratio (OR) for incident wheeze among those with airways responsiveness at a previous visit was 3.91 (95% CI 1.21-12.66), after adjustment for gender, current age in years, parental atopic and asthmatic status, personal smoking, exposure to passive smoke, any lower respiratory infection before two years of age, and personal atopy.</p><p>Another study prospectively evaluated 81 Chinese students aged 11 to 17 years who were found to have AHR in a population survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Eighty-eight age-matched students without AHR served as controls. Fifty students with AHR were asymptomatic, of whom 10 (20 percent) developed asthma over a two year period compared to only two of 88 (2 percent) in the control group. The severity of AHR appeared to predict which subjects would become asthmatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL HISTORY OF ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are clearly components of the asthma phenotype that appear strongly heritable, although these inherited components do not follow the simple Mendelian pattern and the specific genes responsible for these inherited components have yet to be identified. This topic is reviewed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ATOPY AND ALLERGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopy may be defined as the state of having IgE antibodies to specific allergens, which is a prerequisite for developing allergic disease. The association between asthma and other atopic conditions is well-documented. The &quot;atopic march&quot; is a term used to describe the pattern of onset of different allergic diseases that is observed in some atopic individuals. This pattern begins with atopic dermatitis in infancy and childhood, followed by the onset of allergic rhinitis and then asthma during later childhood and adolescence. Not all atopic patients develop all three conditions (eg, only about one-third of children with atopic dermatitis subsequently develop asthma) and there are other patterns of presentation of allergic diseases; however, these conditions are clearly associated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H86702391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of IgE, the class of antibody responsible for the most common form of respiratory allergy, appear to be closely linked with airway hyperresponsiveness, whether or not asthma symptoms are present. Elevations in total IgE levels indicate the presence of allergic sensitization, although this measurement provides no information about the specific allergens to which an individual is sensitized.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) found a wide variation among 22 countries in the fraction of current wheeze attributable to atopic sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The association between wheeze and atopy increased in countries with higher economic development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that half of the asthma cases were attributable to atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Skin testing of 12,106 subjects with a panel of 10 allergens was performed; atopy was defined as having at least one positive skin test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2657 subjects, the prevalence of asthma was closely related to the total serum IgE level, as well as the skin test reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Further analysis showed that asthma correlated better with IgE levels, while allergic rhinitis correlated more closely with skin test reactivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report evaluated 562 11-year-old children who had serum IgE levels determined from a birth cohort of 1037 New Zealand children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of diagnosed asthma was significantly related to the serum IgE level. Even among children without a diagnosis of asthma, the prevalence and degree of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) increased with increasing IgE levels as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AHR was present in 1 percent at an IgE level below 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AHR was present in 12 percent with IgE levels of 100 to 315 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AHR was present in 30 percent with IgE levels above 315 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergen exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consensus is emerging that indoor allergens play a significant role in the development of asthma and recurrent wheeze in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. However, it has been difficult to demonstrate a causative relationship, and the majority of these studies were performed on high risk groups. At least one prospective study of allergen exposure in early childhood, carried out with a cohort from the general population, found that although a minimum threshold level of allergen was necessary for sensitization or asthma to develop, there was no dose-response relationship above that level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The reunification of East and West Germany afforded a unique opportunity to study the effects of environmental exposure on the development of lung disease in two genetically similar populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The prevalence of asthma, atopy (assessed by skin testing), and AHR was greater in West German children than in their counterparts in East Germany. West German children had significantly greater rates of sensitization to mite, cat, and pollen allergens. In contrast, bronchitis was more prevalent in East Germany, where outdoor air pollution was greater. These investigators proposed that the difference in prevalence of asthma between East and West Germany was attributable to the increased prevalence of allergic sensitization to common aeroallergens among children in the western part of the country.</p><p>Sources of indoor allergens include house dust mites, animal proteins (eg, mouse, cat, and dog allergens), cockroaches, and fungi. Changes that have made houses more &quot;energy-efficient&quot; over the years are thought to increase exposure to these allergens, thereby playing a role in the increasing prevalence of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>House dust mite &ndash; In many areas, sensitization to the house dust mite (HDM) appears to have an important association with asthma, potentially contributing to between 65 percent and 90 percent of cases among children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/6,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternaria mold &ndash; In the middle and western United States, where levels of dust mite allergen are low, sensitization and exposure to the ubiquitous mold Alternaria appears to be important for the later development of asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cockroach allergen &ndash; In studies of inner city asthma, sensitization to cockroach allergen has been shown to be a significant risk factor in the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition, morbidity from asthma in inner-city children is associated with the presence of cockroach allergy and exposure to high levels of cockroach allergen in bedroom dust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal allergens &ndash; Early life exposure to indoor cat and dog allergens has been found to be both associated with and protective against the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25,26</a>]. It is possible that other exposures such as environmental tobacco smoke and pollution modulate the impact of early life animal allergen exposure, providing a partial explanation for the variation in development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Farm animals &ndash; Exposure to farm animals early in life is negatively associated with the development of allergic disease. Whether this is due to increased exposure to allergens or increased exposure to a wide range of microbial exposures has been the subject of a number of studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=increasing-prevalence-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis-and-the-role-of-environmental-factors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Increasing prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis and the role of environmental factors&quot;, section on 'Since 1960'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111533375\"><span class=\"h2\">Influence of bacterial exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding associations between allergen exposure and development of asthma are conflicting; while exposure to dust mite and cockroach allergens are associated with an increased risk of asthma, exposure to dog allergen (in some studies) and farm animals appears to be protective (see above). A potential reason for the conflicting data regarding the role of allergen exposure in the development of asthma and also recurrent wheeze in children may be related to the influence of early-life bacterial exposures. </p><p>The Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma study examined allergen exposures in a birth cohort at high risk for asthma (560 children living in urban areas and having a parent with allergic disease) and assessed the bacterial content of house dust in a nested case-control study of 104 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Accumulated allergen exposure (cockroach, cat, and mouse) over the first three years of life was associated with increased allergic sensitization (based on serum IgE) and, in turn, with recurrent wheeze. In contrast, exposure to these allergens in the first year was negatively associated with recurrent wheeze. Moreover, the combination of early-life exposure to these allergens with high-level exposure to bacteria in house dust was associated with a further reduction in risk of recurrent wheeze by age three. These observations suggest that the effects of early life exposures may differ from those of cumulative allergen exposure and that the combination of high-level allergen and bacterial exposure in early-life may be protective against allergen sensitization and recurrent wheeze. The mechanism for this protective effect is not known, but changes in gut microflora and related effects on innate immunity are hypothesized.</p><p>The effect of bacterial exposure after the first year of life may be different from exposure during the first year. One way of assessing bacterial exposure is by measurement of endotoxins, which are inflammatory lipopolysaccharide molecules from gram-negative bacteria. Determinants of endotoxin levels in homes include both indoor sources (eg, pets, pests, humidifiers, kitchen compost bins) and outdoor air. In a nationwide study of 831 representative homes, there was an association between increasing endotoxin levels (greater bacterial exposure) and diagnosed asthma, asthma symptoms in the past year, current use of asthma medications, and wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental control studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies examining the impact of environmental control measures for various allergens are hindered by several recurrent problems. Protocols in which a single allergen is targeted for reduction often fail to produce clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. This is not entirely unexpected, because most allergic individuals are sensitized to multiple allergens, and it is possible that all relevant allergens must be controlled simultaneously. A large Canadian trial found that a multi-faceted allergen mitigation program provided protection against some atopic conditions, although not for airway hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It may also be necessary to tailor the interventions to the specific sensitivities of the patients, which is technically demanding. In addition, reductions in the allergens in question may be significant compared to control groups, but it is not known to what degree most allergens must be reduced in order to prevent sensitization. Environmental control to reduced exposure to allergens is reviewed in more detail separately.

Inhalational accidents (eg, fires, mixing cleaning agents, industrial spills) were also associated with an increased risk of new onset asthma.</p><p>In the Agricultural Health Study of 25,814 adult farm women, growing up on a farm was protective against asthma, but use of certain pesticides (eg, organophosphates) was associated with an increased risk of adult-onset atopic asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">POLLUTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Outdoor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a known correlation between levels of air pollution and lung disease, but the association between air pollution and asthma is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. As an example, in a study of six cities in the United States, there was a direct relationship between the levels of particulate pollution and reported rates of chronic cough and bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

East Germany had consistently high levels of SO<sub>2</sub> and other particulates, whereas West Germany had low levels of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) but slightly higher levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). The prevalence rates of asthma and atopy were higher in the West German towns, while the rates of bronchitis were higher in the East German towns, suggesting at most a minor effect of air pollution on the prevalence of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/19,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large epidemiologic study examined the correlation between asthma symptoms in 990 children in eight North American cities, and the ambient concentrations of five air pollutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-asthma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

While this trial provides data that either of these medications, in usual doses, for the relief of fever or pain in young children will not lead to worsening of existing asthma, the question remains whether the use of these medications either in pregnancy or early childhood, confers increased risk for the development of asthma.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Early abnormalities in pulmonary function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma is more commonly present in individuals with other atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis; although only about a third of children with atopic dermatitis will go on to develop asthma. Increased total serum levels of IgE are associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Sensitization to indoor allergens is strongly associated with asthma, although it has not been demonstrated that allergen exposure increases the risk for developing asthma. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Atopy and allergens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to bacteria and bacterial products may influence the development of allergen sensitization and asthma, although the exact effects appear to depend on the timing of exposure (first year of life versus later in life). The exact mechanism for these effects remains unclear. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Atopy and allergens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (particularly maternal) appear to increase the risk of developing asthma. However, this is difficult to prove in cross-sectional studies as patients with known asthma are less likely to start smoking. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an increased body mass index (BMI) have a greater risk of developing asthma than those with a normal BMI, although the magnitude of the effect is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of prenatal and perinatal factors (eg, maternal age, smoking, diet, and medication use) have been implicated in the development of childhood asthma, although data are conflicting.
