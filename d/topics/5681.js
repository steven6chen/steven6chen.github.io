The job of the immune system is to fight off infection. Normally, it should not react to a drug as though it were an invader, but some drugs can cause that response in some people.</p><p>The symptoms of a drug allergy can include a skin rash, itching, swelling, or &ndash; in severe cases &ndash; trouble breathing or a drop in blood pressure that can cause a person to pass out.</p><p>A drug allergy is <strong>not</strong> the same as a drug side effect. Side effects are unintended or unwanted effects that drugs can cause. Side effects can affect anyone who is given enough of a drug. Drug allergies, on the other hand, affect only a small number of people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623760145\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a drug allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few different types of drug allergy, each with its own set of symptoms.</p><p>One serious type of allergy is called an &quot;immediate&quot; allergy because it starts quickly after a drug is taken (usually within an hour or so). It usually happens with drugs that a person had taken before without any problem. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives, which are raised, red patches of skin that are usually very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing, which is when your skin turns red and feels hot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the face, hands, feet, or throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throat tightness, hoarse voice, wheezing, or trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded</p><p/><p>This type of allergy is serious because it can get worse if you keep taking the medicine. It can turn into a life-threatening whole-body allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis.</p><p>Another type of drug allergy, called a &quot;delayed&quot; allergy, is much more common. This type is not very serious and usually causes a rash that begins after a few days of taking a drug. The rash often spreads over much of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87350\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87350 \">picture 2</a>). Sometimes it is itchy, but sometimes not. This type of drug allergy does not involve swelling, trouble breathing, throat tightness, or the other symptoms listed above. This type of allergy doesn't usually get worse or affect anything besides the skin. (A rare but severe skin reaction to a drug, called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is discussed separately.)

There, your health care team will try to get your body back to normal. To do that, they might have to give you medicines to calm your allergic response. They might also need to give you oxygen to breathe through a mask, and fluids through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>After your symptoms are managed, your doctor will explore what to do about the allergy. If possible, your doctor might try to switch you to a different drug that is less likely to cause the same reaction. If that is not possible, he or she might send you to an allergist (allergy doctor) to decide what to do next.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623760230\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If your allergist suspects you have an immediate drug allergy, he or she might send you for allergy skin tests. The most common is called a skin prick test. For this test, the doctor puts a drop of the drug you might be allergic to on your skin and makes a tiny prick in your skin. He or she then watches your skin to see if it turns red and bumpy.</p><p>If you have a reaction that consists only of a rash (the type that is not serious), your allergist might want to do a &quot;drug challenge test.&quot; For this test, the allergist will have you take a small amount of the drug that caused the rash while he or she observes you. That way the doctor can find out if you will have the same reaction twice. Doctors usually do drug challenge tests only with certain medicines that are used a lot and can't easily be replaced with a different medicine. For example, the antibiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amoxicillin</a> is the best choice of antibiotic for many common infections. Because of this, it's important that people only avoid it if they are truly allergic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623760245\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a drug allergy be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you already know you have a drug allergy, you can reduce your chances of having problems again if you do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell all your doctors and nurses, and anyone who might prescribe medicines for you, about your allergy. Medicines sometimes have more than one ingredient and go by more than one name, so it won't always be obvious if you are being prescribed the problem drug. Also, drugs are sometimes related to each other. If you are allergic to a specific drug, you might also be allergic to others that are related to it. If you tell your doctor or nurse about your allergy, he or she can try to avoid giving you any drugs that could cause problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace explaining your drug allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623760260\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-skin-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Allergy skin testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-you-should-know-about-antibiotics-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What you should know about antibiotics (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
