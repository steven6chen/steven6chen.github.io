CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, which induces cortisol secretion from the adrenal glands.

An observational study of 62 patients found that the use of etomidate for intubation was associated with increased likelihood of having a poor response (&le;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> to ACTH stimulation 24 hours later (odds ratio 12, 95% CI 3-50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The clinical importance of this observation is uncertain. While some evidence suggests that a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> is associated with worse outcomes in patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], a randomized trial that compared etomidate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> for rapid sequence induction found that etomidate was NOT associated with worse clinical outcomes despite an increased incidence of adrenocortical hyporesponsiveness to synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The clinical implications of these findings are uncertain because both studies measured plasma cortisol using an immunoassay, which correlates poorly with the reference standard (liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Head injury, central nervous system depressants, pituitary infarction, adrenal hemorrhage, infections, malignancy, and previous glucocorticoid therapy can also impair the HPA axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Laboratory assays of plasma cortisol concentration and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation are likely unreliable in critically ill patients. In support, guidelines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) were unable to reach consensus to recommend one single test that can reliably diagnose critical illness associated corticosteroid insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, they did agree that change in baseline cortisol at 60&nbsp;min of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;9&nbsp;mcg/dL</span> after cosyntropin (250&nbsp;mcg) administration (ie, high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a>) and a random plasma cortisol of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10&nbsp;mcg/dL</span> may be used. </p><p>Studies describing the performance (diagnostic and prognostic) of these tests in critically ill patients are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Random serum cortisol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total serum cortisol levels vary widely in patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/14,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,27-32</a>]. This observation led multiple investigators to try to determine whether serum cortisol is predictive of mortality in patients with septic shock. Numerous studies found increased mortality associated with both low serum cortisol levels and high serum cortisol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. Other studies were unable to find a relationship between cortisol levels and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/28,30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1783301\"><span class=\"h2\">Free cortisol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In critically ill patients, loss of cortisol binding globulin (CBG) results in decreased protein-bound cortisol and increased free cortisol. Therefore, for any given amount of serum total cortisol, there is a shift from inactive protein-bound cortisol to physiologically active free cortisol. This suggests that standard assays for plasma cortisol (which measure total plasma cortisol) underestimate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. It has been proposed that free cortisol more accurately reflects HPA axis activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>This was illustrated by a study comparing total serum cortisol and free serum cortisol levels in 33 healthy volunteers to those in 60 critically ill patients (18 had sepsis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The critically ill patients had total serum cortisol concentrations that were two to three times higher and free cortisol levels that were 7 to 10 times higher than healthy volunteers. Although the total serum cortisol appeared lower in critically ill patients with hypoalbuminemia (albumin &le;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> than in critically ill patients with preserved albumin concentrations, the free cortisol levels were similar.</p><p>The study has two major limitations. First, the critically ill patients did not include any patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Second, the degree of hemodynamic instability at the time of plasma cortisol sampling was not reported. Thus, it is impossible to correlate the cortisol level with severity of illness or physiologic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The applicability of the study to routine clinical practice is uncertain because the free cortisol assay is not available at most clinical centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In another investigation, 74 patients had their total and free cortisol levels measured before and after the administration of 250 mcg of cosyntropin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-stimulation free cortisol levels were higher in patients with septic shock (186 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> than sepsis (29 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> or healthy controls (13 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-stimulation free cortisol levels reflected the severity of illness more closely than total cortisol levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calculated free cortisol level (based on direct measurements of total cortisol and the CBG concentration) correlated well with the direct measurement of free cortisol.</p><p/><p>Further complicating our understanding of HPA physiology in critical illness, one study suggested that plasma levels of cortisol have only moderate correlation with tissue availability of the hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In a small study (n = 35) of critically ill patients with sepsis, total and free plasma cortisol levels were compared to tissue levels of cortisol, measured using microdialysis catheters inserted into the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the thigh. Plasma cortisol level correlated only moderately with tissue levels. These observations suggest that during critical illness, blood levels of cortisol poorly reflect the amount of hormone available to target tissues.</p><p>Whether the free cortisol level provides useful prognostic information in critically ill patients has not been formally investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">ACTH stimulation tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> requires that a baseline serum cortisol be drawn, synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) administered intravenously and serum cortisol levels are drawn 30 and 60 minutes later.

Few data support the notion that genetic or acquired glucocorticoid receptor abnormalities affect critically ill patients.

The mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance are discussed separately. A study of 41 patients with septic shock and 20 healthy controlled examined the mRNA expression of glucocorticoid alpha and beta splice variants as well as isoforms of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to try to examine whether glucocorticoid resistance might be attributable to receptor variant or degrading enzyme expression. Although septic patients demonstrated much higher expression of the mRNA of the beta-isoform of the glucocorticoid receptor, an isoform which is associated with steroid resistance, functional differences were not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

With this caveat in mind, international guidelines support use of a change in baseline cortisol at 60&nbsp;min of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;9&nbsp;mcg/dL</span> after cosyntropin (250&nbsp;mcg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10&nbsp;mcg/dL</span>. However, in general most clinicians do not rely on laboratory testing to select glucocorticoid replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Assessing adrenal reserve'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suboptimal cortisol production during septic shock has been termed &quot;functional&quot; adrenal insufficiency, &quot;relative&quot; adrenal insufficiency, or &quot;critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI).&quot; Broadly accepted consensus about diagnostic criteria for this entity is lacking. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Relative adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients without shock, or patients with less severe septic shock (defined as those in whom fluid resuscitation and pressor therapy have restored hemodynamic stability), corticosteroid therapy does not appear to be beneficial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies suggest that glucocorticoid therapy is most likely to be beneficial in patients who have severe septic shock (defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg for more than one hour despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration). Whether or not there are subgroups of septic shock patients that could benefit from glucocorticoid therapy is still unknown. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> has failed to consistently identify patients with septic shock that benefit from glucocorticoid use. This, together with the unreliability of available plasma cortisol assays suggest that ACTH stimulation testing is not clinically useful in distinguishing responders from not responders. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adult patients with severe septic shock (defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg for more than one hour following both adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration), we suggest that intravenous glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> &lt;400 mg per day in divided doses) be administered on a case-by case basis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludrocortisone</a> (50 mcg via gastric tube once daily) may be added to hydrocortisone. The basis for this recommendation is that although two randomized trials (CORTICUS and ADRENAL), reported faster resolution of shock without a decrease in the risk of death from hydrocortisone alone in this population, the addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone in sicker patients with severe septic shock was associated with a decreased risk of death at 90 days in one study (APROCCHSS). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of steroids in this population does not appear to be associated with harm (eg, risk of superinfection), other than hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients without shock, or with less severe septic shock (defined as those in whom fluid resuscitation and pressor therapy have restored hemodynamic stability), we suggest NOT administering glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response to ACTH testing should not be used to select patients for glucocorticoid therapy. Since there is no single test to select patients suitable for glucocorticoid therapy, clinical criteria are used. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> for at least three days (typically for five to seven days) and taper the dose as guided by the clinical response. Close observation of those patients whose steroid therapy is stopped without being tapered is warranted. We do not add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> to our regimen.
