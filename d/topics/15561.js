The disorder can occur in infants, children, and adults. Cumulatively, there have been fewer than 300 cases reported in the literature, and understanding of this condition is therefore preliminary. This topic review discusses the normal immunophysiology of IgM, theories of pathogenesis, and the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of sIgMD. More general discussions of antibody deficiency are found separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-of-immunoglobulins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure of immunoglobulins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Naive B lymphocytes express both IgM and IgD, and these are the only immunoglobulin isotypes produced by B lymphocytes prior to contact with antigen. Membrane-bound monomeric IgM, complexed with additional proteins, such as Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, constitute the B cell receptor for antigen. Naive B lymphocytes use alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing to make both IgM and IgD. The mu and delta constant region (C) genes, which code for the M and D heavy chains respectively, are those nearest to the assembled VDJ sequence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75596 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Following binding of antigen by the B lymphocyte receptor, signaling occurs through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), leading to activation of intracellular pathways, which ultimately culminate in changes in B lymphocyte gene expression. In the presence of appropriate activation (costimulators, cytokines, etc), B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin heavy chain constant genes to switch from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77742\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77742 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-igm-deficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Secreted IgM exists as a pentamer and has a half-life of about 10 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79613 \">figure 3</a>). Because of its pentameric structure, IgM is referred to as &quot;macroglobulin.&quot; Pentameric IgM, which has 10 antigen binding sites, readily forms antigen-antibody complexes and has high avidity, despite the fact that each individual binding site has relatively low affinity for antigen. Because of this, IgM is an exceptionally potent activator of the classical complement pathway. IgM does not activate the alternative pathway of complement, nor does it undergo transplacental transfer. The majority of IgM is intravascular in location, and accordingly, selective immunoglobulin M deficiency (sIgMD) is often associated with systemic infections and bacteremia. </p><p>The majority of natural antibodies (ie, immunoglobulins that react with multiple endogenous or exogenous antigens without prior antigenic stimulation) and autoantibodies are of the IgM class. These antibodies are polyspecific and of low affinity, and appear to play an important role in removal of self antigens and clearing of dead cells (housekeeping), homeostasis, and protection against microbes (especially microbes with polysaccharide components) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-igm-deficiency/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. IgM may regulate the selection of B lymphocyte subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-igm-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The IgM response wanes as other subtypes are produced. Examples of specific disorders in which IgM responses are used in diagnosis include isohemagglutinins (which are mostly IgM, but also IgG), cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor, and the heterophile antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-igm-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

We advise patients to seek medical care promptly for fevers or infections that seem to be worsening. We provide them with a letter signed by the evaluating clinician, which states that the patient has sIgMD, a disorder that is sometimes associated with serious infections, such as bacteremia and sepsis. We do this to encourage a thorough evaluation in urgent care and emergency department settings, and to increase the likelihood that providers will err on the side of caution when treating these individuals. We counsel patients in this manner even if they are asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6107180\"><span class=\"h2\">Prompt evaluation and treatment of infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If infection is suspected, we evaluate patients promptly, obtain cultures when possible, and have a low threshold for initiating antimicrobials. We follow these individuals closely to assure the infections are fully cleared before terminating treatment. Patients with immunodeficiencies are less likely to clear minor infections without antimicrobials, and more likely to require prolonged courses of treatment to eradicate established infections. We provide patients with an informational handout about seeking prompt evaluation for infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62481 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6107188\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures to prevent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures to prevent recurrent infections include vaccinations, aggressive management of allergic respiratory disease, and in some cases, prophylactic antibiotics or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who respond immunologically to vaccination, even if the response is partial, should be fully vaccinated.
