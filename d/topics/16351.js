It remains a major global health problem affecting an estimated 248 million persons of whom roughly 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Interferons (IFN) have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. IFN-alfa and IFN-beta have predominantly antiviral effects, while IFN-gamma has more marked immunomodulatory, but less potent antiviral activity. IFN-alfa is the most widely studied and the only IFN approved for the treatment of HBV in most countries. Although standard IFN was initially used, it has generally been replaced by pegylated interferon (PegIFN). PegIFN alfa-2a is approved in the United States. In many other countries, PegIFN alfa-2b is also used for treatment of chronic HBV. </p><p>This topic will review the use of IFN for the treatment of adults with chronic HBV. Topic reviews that provide a more general overview of the treatment of HBV in adults and children are found elsewhere.

IFN is thought to induce specific genes that interfere with several steps in the HBV lifecycle, including: virus entry; uncoating of the virion; transcription of viral DNA into RNA; translation of viral RNA into proteins; and assembly of nucleocapsids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It may also augment cell-mediated immunity, thereby promoting clearance of HBV-infected hepatocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and pathogenesis of infection&quot;, section on 'Replication cycle'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus-and-pathogenesis-of-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of the hepatitis B virus and pathogenesis of infection&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of infection'</a>.)</p><p>IFN's effect on HBV transcription appears to be partly mediated by epigenetic modifications of the HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) minichromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, IFN can induce degradation of cccDNA by induction of APOBEC3s (DNA editing enzymes) that can degrade foreign, but not host, DNAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These findings may explain why IFN treatment results in a higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen loss, and a more durable response compared with nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1161896353\" class=\"local\">'Virologic response'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1365334608\" class=\"local\">'Studies of interferon therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3487193354\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161896353\"><span class=\"h2\">Virologic response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive response to interferon (IFN) is characterized by suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (in patients who were initially HBeAg-positive). This is followed by loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in some patients during the course of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Assessment of off-treatment response is important with IFN treatment, since loss of HBeAg and HBsAg, and seroconversion to hepatitis B e antibody may be delayed. (See <a href=\"#H977571836\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Most responders are able to maintain their virologic response after cessation of treatment during follow-up of 5 to 10 years, unless they become immunocompromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-15</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the largest reports with long-term follow-up focused on 165 patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV who were treated with IFN between 1978 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Response to treatment was defined as HBeAg loss within 12 months after the end of therapy. Patients were followed for a median of 8.8 years. Fifty-four patients (33 percent) responded. Relapse occurred in only seven of the responders (13 percent). Loss of HBsAg during long-term follow-up was observed in 52 percent of responders, compared with only 9 percent of nonresponders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report focused on 266 patients treated with pegylated interferon (PegIFN) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, of whom 37 percent lost HBeAg during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of 172 patients with follow-up data, 81 percent of those who lost HBeAg within 24 weeks of completing a 48-week course of treatment continued to be HBeAg-negative up to three years after cessation of treatment. Loss of HBsAg was achieved in 30 percent of patients who lost HBeAg (58 percent of those with genotype A and only 6 percent with non-A genotypes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study included a total of 315 patients with HBeAg-negative HBV who were followed for three years after treatment with PegIFN (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>) or with lamivudine alone for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Three years after treatment, the proportion of patients with normal serum ALT levels was significantly higher in patients treated with PegIFN (31 versus 18 percent). Similarly, more patients treated with PegIFN achieved HBV DNA levels of &le;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> (28 versus 15 percent) and HBsAg loss (9 versus 0 percent). This study found that approximately 25 percent of HBeAg-negative patients treated with PegIFN for 48 weeks had a durable response when virologic response was defined as HBV DNA &le;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> and approximately 14 percent had a durable response when virologic response was defined as HBV DNA &le;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 80 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span>. </p><p/><p>Disappearance of HBV DNA in serum, as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, occurs in 50 to 100 percent of patients who clear both HBeAg and HBsAg. This usually occurs at the time the patient becomes HBsAg-negative; disappearance of HBV DNA is seldom achieved in patients who clear HBeAg but remain HBsAg-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although IFN is associated with a higher rate of HBsAg loss compared with nucleos(t)ide analogues, loss of HBsAg occurs in only 5 to 10 percent of patients who receive PegIFN when assessed 24 weeks after completing a one-year course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, it is rarely observed in Asian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Patients treated with PegIFN monotherapy or combination therapy are significantly more likely to achieve a virologic response (eg, HBV DNA suppression, HBeAg seroconversion, and HBsAg loss) compared with those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

However, data are scant, since in most studies the duration of follow-up was short. In addition, these benefits were mainly observed in patients who achieved a sustained response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/8,11,13,16,23,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,13,16,23,26,27</a>]. </p><p>The benefits of standard IFN on HCC have also been demonstrated by several meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. In one analysis, the relative risk of HCC among those treated with interferon compared with those who were untreated was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Data on the impact of PegIFN treatment on clinical outcome are limited. However, one retrospective study that included 153 PegIFN experienced and 177 nucleos(t)ide analogue experienced patients found that the group who received PegIFN had a reduced risk of developing HCC compared with those who received nucleoside analogs (adjusted hazard ration 0.13; 95% CI 0.016-0.987) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1433704097\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>Interferon may be most suitable for patients who desire a finite duration of treatment (eg, young adults and women planning to conceive in the future), particularly if they are HBeAg-positive and are infected with HBV genotype A, and if a week 12 stop rule will be applied. However, interferon has been associated with more side effects compared with nucleos(t)ide analogues. Thus, the decision to use PegIFN or a nucleos(t)ide analogue as primary therapy should be made after careful discussion with the patient.

However, several studies have adopted an add-on or sequential approach, where patients start nucleos(t)ide analogue first and PegIFN is then added or nucleos(t)ide analogues are initiated and the patient is then switched to PegIFN.

In addition, eight patients switched to PegIFN, but none who continued entecavir monotherapy cleared HBsAg.

HBsAg loss occurred more commonly in HBeAg-positive patients and in those with genotype A infection.

It remains a major global health problem affecting an estimated 248 million persons of whom roughly 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon (IFN)-alfa is thought to induce specific IFN-stimulated genes that inhibit HBV transcription. IFN's effect on HBV transcription appears to be partly mediated by epigenetic modifications of the HBV covalently closed circular DNA minichromosome. (See <a href=\"#H3583006401\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive response to IFN is usually defined as the loss of serum HBV DNA, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (in patients who were HBeAg-positive), followed by loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in some patients. Assessment of off-treatment response is important with IFN treatment, since loss of HBeAg and HBsAg may be delayed. A successful virologic response is usually associated with decreased necroinflammatory activity, reduced liver damage, and decreased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H3487193354\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFN, preferably pegylated, should be considered as a treatment option for adult patients with chronic HBV infection. IFN may be most suitable for patients who desire a finite duration of treatment, such as young adults, and women who are planning to conceive in the future, since IFN has been associated with more side effects compared with nucleos(t)ide analogues. (See <a href=\"#H3376566340\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFN is most likely to benefit patients with replicative infection (HBV DNA levels &gt;20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for HBeAg-positive patients and &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for HBeAg-negative patients) and active liver disease (serum alanine aminotransferase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal or chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy). Among such patients who are HBeAg-positive, those who are genotype A and have an HBV DNA &lt;2 x 10<sup>8</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> are more likely to have a favorable response. (See <a href=\"#H605626588\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFN is contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a history of suicidal tendency or active psychiatric illness, autoimmune illness, severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, and concurrent severe systemic disorders. In addition, IFN should <strong>not</strong> be used in women who are pregnant given concerns for pregnancy loss. (See <a href=\"#H1433704097\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pegylated interferon (PegIFN)-alfa 2a should be administered subcutaneously at a dose of 180 mcg once weekly for 48 weeks. The approach to treatment is described in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58668\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58668 \">algorithm 1</a>). Standard IFN should be used only if pegylated interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues are not available. (See <a href=\"#H1546868424\" class=\"local\">'Treatment regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving IFN therapy should be assessed for evidence of toxicity, as well as for virologic, serologic, and biochemical response both during treatment and after therapy has been completed. We monitor patients at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48 during treatment, and weeks 12, 24, and 48 post treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109129\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109129 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H977571836\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond to IFN can be treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> and tenofovir are preferred. Existing studies indicate that these patients respond just as well as those who are IFN-na&iuml;ve.
