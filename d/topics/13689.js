They are the most common cause of worm infections in the US. Pinworm infections usually affect school-age children.</p><p>People who have pinworms can have intense itching around their anus. That's because the female worms lay their eggs in the folds of skin around the anus.</p><p>People catch pinworms when they swallow pinworm eggs. This can happen when someone with a pinworm infection scratches their anus, touches things that other people might touch, and leaves eggs behind. Then, when someone touches the eggs and touches their mouth, they can swallow the eggs without knowing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110477896\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pinworms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with pinworms don't have any symptoms. When people do have symptoms, the most common symptom is itching around the anus. The itching happens most often at night and can cause trouble sleeping. Some people with a severe case of pinworms might also have belly pain, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110477911\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have severe itching around the anus, especially at night, you should see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110477926\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for pinworms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. After learning about your symptoms, your doctor or nurse will have you do a &quot;scotch tape&quot; test. This test involves taking a piece of scotch tape and pressing it on the skin around your anus. If you have pinworms, the eggs will stick to the tape. The doctor or nurse will look at the tape under a microscope to see if there are pinworm eggs on the tape. (You can't see the eggs by just looking at the tape.) It is best to apply the tape at night or first thing in the morning before you bathe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110477941\"><span class=\"h1\">How are pinworms treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pinworms are treated with medicine. People being treated usually take a pill when they first find out they have pinworms. Then, they take another pill 2 weeks later.</p><p>If you have pinworms, your doctor or nurse will probably want all the people who live with you to take the medicine. This is because pinworms spread easily between people in the same home.</p><p>Even after you are treated, the pinworms might still come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110477956\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I should do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or anyone in your family has pinworms, you all should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your fingernails clipped short.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a shower or bath every day. (In the morning is best.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your clothes, towels, and bed linens often.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to scratch around your anus or between your legs.</p><p/><p>See your doctor or nurse if you start having itching around your anus again.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
