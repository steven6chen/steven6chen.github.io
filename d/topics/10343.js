Oligodendroglial tumors typically arise in the fourth to sixth decades, with low-grade tumors occurring at an earlier age than anaplastic tumors. Despite the prolonged clinical course seen with oligodendroglial tumors, the outcome is almost always fatal.</p><p>Historically, the management of patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors was based upon results from studies in patients with malignant gliomas, carried out prior to the recognition of the molecular and prognostic differences between oligodendroglial and other glial tumors. Compared with astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors are more likely to harbor certain favorable molecular markers, such as co-deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) and mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Such mutations are relevant to treatment planning and prognosis.</p><p>The treatment of anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, pathology, and molecular prognostic factors of oligodendroglial tumors and the management of low-grade oligodendrogliomas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas: Clinical features, pathology, and prognostic factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-grade-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low-grade glioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery provides tissue to establish the diagnosis and is used to relieve symptoms due to mass effect in patients with suspected anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. As with other high-grade gliomas, maximal resection is the preferred approach, but partial resection or biopsy may be required, depending upon the location and extent of the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Extent of resection'</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials that have established the benefit of maximal surgical resection compared with a more limited resection, and such studies are unlikely to be conducted. Evidence supporting this approach specifically in oligodendroglial tumors comes from secondary analyses of two large trials, which demonstrated a positive association between a more extensive resection and prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anaplastic-oligodendroglial-tumors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, in retrospective studies, small, superficial tumors with a relatively favorable prognosis are more likely to have been extensively resected, while large, deep-seated, or midline tumors with a poorer prognosis will not have been completely resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anaplastic-oligodendroglial-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Limited data suggest that the presence of a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 may be an additional factor relevant to the association between extent of resection and overall survival. In a retrospective series of high-grade astrocytic tumors, a positive association between gross total resection (of both enhancing and nonenhancing components) and overall survival was observed for IDH1-mutant tumors but not wild-type tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anaplastic-oligodendroglial-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is not yet clear whether this effect is also relevant for oligodendroglial tumors, or whether the association is confounded by factors relating to resectability. &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175763196\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2629883021\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgery, evidence from multiple randomized trials strongly supports the use of both radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy rather than RT alone in patients with anaplastic gliomas. There is some uncertainty regarding the optimal chemotherapy in various patient subgroups, and treatment decisions should be individualized. The presence or absence of a 1p19q co-deletion may help to determine the optimal approach.</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with consensus-based guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as well as the European Association for Neuro-Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anaplastic-oligodendroglial-tumors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4290900045\"><span class=\"h3\">1p19q co-deleted tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with 1p19q co-deleted tumors, both PCV (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lomustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lomustine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> are reasonable options, and there is no consensus among experts about which regimen is preferred.</p><p>Use of PCV is supported by two large randomized trials in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors, in which the addition of PCV to RT was associated with improved progression-free and overall survival compared with RT alone in those with 1p19q co-deleted tumors.

Many of these tumors contain a characteristic co-deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q), which has been correlated with both a striking sensitivity to chemotherapy and a more prolonged natural history, independent of specific treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue of grade II and III gliomas should be routinely tested to determine whether co-deletion of 1p19q and IDH mutations are present, as this information is necessary to accurately diagnose these tumors as of the 2016 WHO classification system. Testing for MGMT should also be considered.

Although gross total resection is preferred whenever possible, subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy may be required depending upon the location and extent of the tumor.
