In later fibrotic stages, the peripheral blood demonstrates teardrop-shaped red cells (ie, dacrocytes), nucleated red blood cells, and early myeloid forms (ie, a triad termed leukoerythroblastosis), and extramedullary hematopoiesis results in hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. PMF has had numerous names in the past, including agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. </p><p>The related myeloproliferative neoplasms essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) can both undergo delayed disease transformation into a fibrotic state called post-ET myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) or post-PV MF, respectively. The conversion rates after 10 to 20 years of disease are less than 5 percent for ET and approximately 10 to 20 percent for PV. PMF, post-ET MF, and post-PV MF are all referred to as myelofibrosis.</p><p>The treatment of PMF will be reviewed here. An overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as discussions of prognosis, pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PMF, are presented separately.

Other treatment modalities are, at best, palliative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Most patients will not be candidates for HCT, and their care will focus on the alleviation of symptoms.</p><p>Most patients with PMF present with anemia, marked splenomegaly, early satiety, and hypercatabolic symptoms including severe fatigue, low-grade fever, night sweats, bone pain, and weight loss. During their clinical course, most patients experience massive splenomegaly, some hepatomegaly, along with progressive anemia requiring frequent red blood cell transfusions. Portal hypertension might accompany marked splenomegaly and could contribute to variceal bleeding or ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-primary-myelofibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Splenomegaly is the result of extramedullary hematopoiesis, which might also involve other organ sites, including the liver, around the spinal column (causing cord compression), or in the pleural and peritoneal cavity (causing pleural effusion or ascites), or any other organ including brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603213\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with PMF (and post-ET and post-PV MF) should have a history and physical examination that includes documentation of their transfusion history, the impact of symptoms on their daily function, and a measurement of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. In addition, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with PMF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential with review of the peripheral smear, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), chemistries with liver and renal function, pretransfusion serum erythropoietin level, serum ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and for those who require HLA-matched platelets. Lymphocytotoxic (anti-HLA) antibody screen should be performed for multiparous women and multiply-transfused patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with PMF.

Evaluation should also include an assessment of other symptoms that impact daily life. While formal symptom assessment forms are available, many clinicians do not use them outside of a clinical trial setting (eg, myeloproliferative neoplasm symptom assessment total symptom score, which assigns a score of 0 to 10 for each of 11 items: fatigue, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, difficulty concentrating, <span class=\"nowrap\">numbness/tingling</span> in hands and feet, night sweats, pruritus, diffuse bone pain, fever, and unintentional weight loss over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with PMF is largely dictated by the risk of disease progression and estimated overall survival as calculated by prognostic scores.

For now, this system provides a relatively straightforward way to identify those patients who need more aggressive initial therapy (high-risk disease) and those who may safely be treated with symptom-directed therapy (low-risk or very-low-risk disease). The management of intermediate-risk disease is less clear. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2068293469\"><span class=\"h2\">High- or intermediate-risk disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7998745\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We define high- and intermediate-risk disease using the risk stratification scheme described above, which incorporates the DIPSS Plus score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-dynamic-international-prognostic-scoring-system-plus-dipss-plus-for-primary-myelofibrosis-pmf-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), the status of favorable mutations (<em>CALR</em> type 1 or type 1-like mutations), and the status of high-risk mutations (<em>ASXL1</em>, <em>SRSF2</em>, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em>,</span> and <em>EZH2</em> mutations) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105008\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105008 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with high- or intermediate-risk PMF have estimated survival rates less than three years with symptom-directed care. Allogeneic HCT offers the potential for cure in this population, although at a substantial risk of transplant-related mortality. For patients with high- or intermediate-risk PMF, we suggest allogeneic HCT shortly after diagnosis. We prefer conventional intensity conditioning for those &lt;45 years of age and reduced-intensity conditioning for those 45 to 65 years of age. Patients who are not candidates for HCT are encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Alternatively, they can be managed with palliative, symptom-directed therapies such as those used for low-risk disease. For patients with debilitating constitutional symptoms or severely symptomatic splenomegaly, we offer treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ruxolitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ruxolitinib</a>.

It is unclear whether it is of benefit to those with DIPSS intermediate-1-risk disease. In contrast, patients with DIPSS intermediate-2- and high-risk disease who are able to undergo HCT appear to have superior survival when compared with those who are treated with conventional therapies. It is not known how this compares with treatment with JAK2 inhibitors.</p><p>The potential for improvement in both medical and transplant therapy suggests that the decision concerning if and when to employ HCT will continue to be a complex issue. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group (EBMT) have developed consensus recommendations for HCT in PMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They suggest HCT for patients &lt;70 years of age with intermediate-2- or high-risk DIPSS Plus scores and patients &lt;65 years of age with intermediate-1 DIPSS Plus score with refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia, or a percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood &gt;2, or adverse cytogenetics. While these consensus recommendations are reasonable, they do not incorporate genotype status, and the incorporation of age cutoffs into eligibility criteria for HCT is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Eligibility for allogeneic HCT varies by center. A discussion of eligibility is presented separately.

However, most reports of HCT in PMF have included relatively small numbers of patients with a median age of approximately 40 to 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>]. This represents a small subset of patients since only 17 percent of those with PMF present before the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

On the other hand, responses to donor lymphocyte infusions in patients relapsing after HCT suggest the presence of a graft-versus-myelofibrosis effect in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/2,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22-25</a>].

Postsurgical complications include intra-abdominal bleeding, subphrenic abscess, sepsis, extreme thrombocytosis that may be associated with thrombosis (eg, stroke, pulmonary embolus, portal vein thrombosis), and accelerated hepatomegaly in 16 to 24 percent due to worsening hepatic myeloid metaplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of splenic sequestration of immature myeloid precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. </p><p>The thrombocytosis and hepatomegaly may be transiently controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> (starting dose 500 mg PO three times per day) or the purine analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a> (a two-hour intravenous administration of 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for five days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. Thrombocytosis may also be transiently controlled with plateletpheresis. Once postoperative hemostasis has been achieved, short-term anticoagulation (eg, one month of therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin) may be reasonable in order to minimize the risk of splanchnic vein thrombosis.</p><p>As noted above, splenectomy is often performed in an attempt to reduce extremely high transfusion requirements associated with splenic sequestration. The question has been raised concerning the potential effect of splenectomy in removing an important site of (extramedullary) erythropoiesis, thereby worsening transfusion requirements. The following information may be helpful in making this decision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massively enlarged spleens, even with significant degrees of erythropoiesis, also exhibit significant degrees of splenic sequestration and ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transfusion requirement for an adult with no effective erythropoiesis (as in severe aplastic anemia or pure red cell aplasia) is usually two to three units of packed red cells every two weeks. Thus, a chronic transfusion requirement in a nonbleeding patient with PMF greater than three units of red cells every two weeks indicates that the spleen is not an &quot;effective&quot; source of red cell production.</p><p/><p>Another concern that has been raised is the potential facilitation of leukemic transformation following splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The concern of these investigators was based on a retrospective series of splenectomized patients compared with a &quot;control&quot; group of patients who had not undergone splenectomy. In our experience, it is impossible to case-match patients who are in need of splenectomy. However, splenic histopathology may help in determining the course of the disease post-splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Thus, the presence of microscopic splenic infarcts, a pattern of immature granulocyte predominance, or the detection of an abnormal splenic karyotype were found to be significantly associated with decreased survival post-splenectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107163810\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenic irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic irradiation (SI) usually provides only a transient (three to six months) benefit and is often complicated by nausea and cytopenias.

The median dose of SI per course was 2.8 Gy, administered in a median of 7.5 fractions. Significant cytopenia occurred in 32 percent of courses, and life-threatening pancytopenia after a single course of SI occurred in six patients (26 percent), resulting in fatal sepsis or hemorrhage in three. Nine patients underwent subsequent splenectomy with a perioperative mortality of 11 percent; three of these required re-exploration for postoperative bleeding.</p><p>We and other centers have also used total SI doses as low as 0.10 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>] and as high as 65 Gy, with generally excellent results, especially if SI is started in small fractions of 0.25 to 0.50 Gy given two to four times per week, with modifications as dictated by the clinical situation and frequently obtained blood counts. The range of regimens can be illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 14 patients with PMF treated with SI for symptoms due to splenomegaly, doses ranged from 7 to 24 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Fourteen of 19 courses given for splenic pain produced a significant subjective relief, while 17 of 26 courses given for splenomegaly obtained at least 50 percent reduction in splenic size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third report, radiation therapy to the entire spleen was delivered by two parallel opposed fields using 0.5 Gy daily fractions given five days per week for a total dose of 6 to 10 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-primary-myelofibrosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. For the 21 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, reduction in splenic size, pain control, improvement of hemoglobin level, and improvement in platelet count were noted in 79, 87, 84, and 68 percent of patients, respectively. The mean duration of response was 19 months (range: 4 to 42 months). Grade III to IV toxicity rates for leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were 14, 25, and 10 percent, respectively.

Most patients present with anemia, marked splenomegaly, early satiety, and hypercatabolic symptoms including severe fatigue, low-grade fever, night sweats, bone pain, and weight loss. The related MPNs essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) can both undergo delayed disease transformation into a fibrotic state with a similar constellation of signs and symptoms called post-ET myelofibrosis or post-PV myelofibrosis, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only treatment modality with a curative potential in PMF. Other treatment options are palliative and directed at symptom management. Most patients will not be candidates for HCT and their care will focus on the alleviation of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of patients with PMF is largely dictated by the risk of disease progression and estimated overall survival as calculated by prognostic scores (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105008\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105008 \">algorithm 1</a>). We use the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) Plus score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-dynamic-international-prognostic-scoring-system-plus-dipss-plus-for-primary-myelofibrosis-pmf-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105009 \">table 3</a>) as a baseline risk assessment and incorporate information about gene mutations in <em>CALR</em>, <em>ASXL</em>, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em>,</span> and <em>EZH2</em>, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High- or intermediate-risk disease &ndash; Patients with high- or intermediate-risk PMF have estimated survival rates less than three years with symptom-directed care. Allogeneic HCT offers the potential for cure in this population, although at a substantial risk of transplant-related mortality. For patients with high- or intermediate-risk PMF, we suggest allogeneic HCT shortly after diagnosis rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The choice between myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning depends on a number of factors including age and the biologic aggressiveness of the underlying clonal process. Patients who are not candidates for HCT are encouraged to participate in clinical trials. For patients with debilitating constitutional symptoms or severely symptomatic splenomegaly not participating in a clinical trial, we offer treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ruxolitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ruxolitinib</a>.
