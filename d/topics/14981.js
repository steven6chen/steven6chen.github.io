By comparison, the frequency of HBV-related renal disease is low in patients born in the United States and western Europe due to the lower prevalence of chronic HBV infection in general and a lower likelihood of childhood infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Although some patients with HBV-related renal disease have a history of active hepatitis, a large proportion of patients have only mild to moderate elevations in serum aminotransferases.</p><p>The pathogenetic role of HBV infection has been documented primarily by the demonstration of hepatitis B antigen-antibody complexes in the renal lesions via immunofluorescence microscopy, including deposition of HBeAg in membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. The relationship between HBV variants (eg, precore and core promoter mutations) that prevent or decrease HBeAg production (despite active viral replication by DNA testing) and renal disease has not been well described.

In addition, HBV X protein has been shown to induce a proinflammatory phenotype in renal tubular epithelial cells, although the impact of increased tubulointerstitial inflammation on glomerular pathology has not been investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF RENAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The renal diseases most commonly associated with HBV infection include membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>].

The clinical manifestations of these three diseases are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Compared with patients who have idiopathic or primary membranous nephropathy, patients with HBV-associated membranous nephropathy are more likely to have microscopic hematuria and lower complement levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The histologic presence of mesangial or subendothelial immune deposits, in addition to the typical subepithelial localization, may be a clue to suggest secondary rather than primary membranous nephropathy.</p><p>The phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) has been implicated as the major antigen involved in the pathogenesis of primary membranous nephropathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Phospholipase A2 receptor'</a>). Several studies have shown a low prevalence of anti-PLA2R antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PLA2R staining of the immune deposits in HBV-associated membranous nephropathy. However, one retrospective study of 39 cases of hepatitis B-associated membranous nephropathy found that 64 percent of cases exhibited strong PLA2R staining of immune deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Staining for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) colocalized with PLA2R within the deposits. Among the six cases for which serum was available, all were positive for anti-PLA2R antibodies. The association between hepatitis B infection and PLA2R-positive membranous nephropathy needs to be validated by further studies.</p><p>It has been proposed that the deposition of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) immune complexes in the subepithelial region of the glomerular basement membrane is pivotal to disease pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,6,7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7,19</a>]. HBV-associated membranous nephropathy is more common in children and resolves spontaneously in many cases, usually in association with seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By contrast, spontaneous resolution is relatively uncommon in adults, and some patients show progressive renal deterioration over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2,7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,20</a>].

The deposition of circulating antigen-antibody complexes in the mesangium and subendothelial space characterizes the MPGN associated with HBV. Both HBsAg and HBeAg deposition have been implicated in this disorder, although their exact role remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In one series of 12 patients with HBV-associated cryoglobulinemia, all patients had nephrotic-range proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, and 9 (75 percent) had impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A purpuric rash was present in more than one-half of the patients (58 percent), and all patients had evidence of hypocomplementemia and were positive for rheumatoid factor. Histologic features of MPGN were present in the kidney biopsies of all patients; only three patients had glomerular deposits of HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), or HBeAg. One-half of the patients died or developed end-stage renal disease during follow-up despite having received various immunosuppressive and antiviral treatments.

The presence of HBV-associated disease is suggested by the findings of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA (an indicator of viral replication) in the serum. The deposition of circulating antigen-antibody immune complexes in the vessel wall triggers downstream inflammatory processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

It is particularly important to consider this diagnosis in patients from endemic areas, where HBV is more prevalent. A kidney biopsy is often required to confirm the presence of an underlying glomerular process, although a different tissue site may be biopsied to confirm polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;, section on 'Biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, a diagnosis of HBV-associated renal disease should be considered in all patients with unknown HBV status who have evidence of nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis or are found on kidney biopsy to have histologic evidence of membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), or PAN. Such patients should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as part of their initial evaluation. If positive, additional testing for serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA should be performed to ascertain the viral replicative state. Concurrent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be considered and investigated as appropriate.

Such patients are often HBeAg positive. However, confirming the etiologic role of HBV in any of these disorders may, at times, be difficult since the detection of viral antigen deposition in the kidney requires techniques that may not be available in many clinical settings. In addition, the presence of viral antigens in the renal tissue may be coincidental rather than indicative of a causal relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Proof that HBV is the primary cause of the renal disease can only be provided by improvement in the renal disease with antiviral therapy and viral suppression.</p><p>Diagnosing HBV-associated renal disease is important because therapy with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic agents, which are common therapies for primary forms of the above disorders, may not be beneficial in patients with HBV-associated renal disease and may lead to reactivation of HBV replication, hepatitis flares, and liver failure if used without antiviral therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of HBV-associated renal diseases consists of antiviral therapy in most patients. This recommendation is consistent with treatment guidelines produced by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. By contrast, immunosuppressive therapy, with or without plasmapheresis, is used only in select patients (eg, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [RPGN] or polyarteritis nodosa [PAN] with severe manifestations), and, when it is administered, it should be used in combination with antiviral therapy.</p><p>The limited data on the treatment of HBV-associated renal diseases are based upon small case series and clinical trials. In addition, antiviral therapy in children and adults with HBV-associated renal disease differs because the natural history of such diseases also differs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1340634\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1340671\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend antiviral therapy for patients with HBV-associated renal disease and detectable serum HBV DNA or positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg).

In responders, remission persisted for a long period after therapy was discontinued. Patients with membranoproliferative disease appeared less responsive to treatment.
