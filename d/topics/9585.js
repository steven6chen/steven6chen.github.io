The vast majority of patients with JMML have somatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> germline mutations of genes within the <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/MAPK</span> signaling pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for JMML. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of JMML will be reviewed here. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are discussed separately. Overviews of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms are discussed separately.

The vast majority of children with JMML have somatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> germline mutations of genes involved in the <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/MAPK</span> signaling pathway. The resultant pathologic activation of signaling causes hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to the granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In vitro hypersensitivity of <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> colonies to GM-CSF long represented a diagnostic tool for JMML, and is still used as a minor diagnostic criterion for those patients without an identified underlying molecular defect. (See <a href=\"#H3367854476\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutations in <em>NF1, PTPN11, KRAS, NRAS, </em>or<em> CBL</em> are found in more than 90 percent of patients with JMML. Alterations of <em>JAK2, TET2, RUNX1, ASXL1, </em>and<em> FLT3</em>, which are commonly associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) of adulthood, are rarely seen in JMML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-9</a>]. In most cases, the mutations associated with JMML are mutually exclusive within a given individual, suggesting that a mutation in any one of these genes is sufficient to activate the signaling pathway and drive the proliferation of JMML cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Whole exome sequencing has detected secondary mutations of other signaling molecules in a minority of patients, and these secondary mutations may be associated with tumor progression and worse clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>DNA hypermethylation at several target genes has been observed in JMML, and this phenomenon may contribute to treatment resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Although some of the proposed targets of epigenetic silencing are involved with cell proliferation (eg, <em>CDKN2B, RASA4</em>), it is unknown whether these contribute to the pathogenesis of the malignant phenotype or are simply epiphenomena (ie, collateral effects) of a broader hypermethylation phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3405085378\"><span class=\"h2\">Ras pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ras signaling proteins are ubiquitously expressed small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) molecules that play diverse roles in cell cycle control, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Activation of Ras stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which includes Raf, PI3K, and Ral-GDS. Key components of the pathway are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108739 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Mutations of <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/MAPK</span> pathway genes that have been reported in JMML include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>NF1</em> (neurofibromin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>PTPN11</em> (SHP2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>KRAS</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>NRAS</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>CBL</em> (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma)</p><p/><p>Mutations associated with JMML activate the RAS pathway by several mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. Some of these mutations block inactivation of the Ras proteins leaving them in an &quot;on&quot; state. As an example, neurofibromin (NF1), a GTPase activating protein (GAP), normally functions to accelerate GTP hydrolysis and thereby &quot;turns off&quot; Ras. Mutation of <em>NF1</em> blunts this mechanism for deactivation of Ras and results in increased Ras activity. </p><p>Other mutations promote the activation of Ras. Mutations in <em>PTPN11</em> lead to activation of SHP2 and ultimately Ras. <em>RAS</em> mutations can result in increased activation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resistance to GAP inactivation. Mutations of <em>CBL</em>, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contributes to degradation of certain signaling molecules, is postulated to lead to cytokine-independent growth. Regardless of the upstream mechanism of activation, increased Ras activity stimulates the MAPK cascade, including Raf, P13K, and Ral-GDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>While mutations in hematopoietic cells are the cause of JMML in nearly all cases, mutations in other cells in the bone marrow microenvironment may play a role in other cases. This was suggested in an animal model of JMML in which <em>PTPN11</em> mutations in bone marrow stroma cells, but not in the hematopoietic cells themselves, caused an MPN that is indistinguishable from that mutation of <em>PTPN11</em> in hematopoietic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This suggests that abnormal Ras signaling in the bone marrow milieu alone may be sufficient to cause JMML, and might account for some of the patients who lack the characteristic mutations of JMML in hematopoietic cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3367696133\"><span class=\"h3\">Germline RAS/MAPK pathway mutations and associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A group of distinctive genetic syndromes arise from germline mutations in genes of the <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/MAPK</span> pathways. These mutations induce constitutive activation of the pathway, and are collectively known as &quot;RASopathies,&quot; or neuro-cardio-facio cutaneous syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These disorders have a propensity to develop malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms. The most frequent and best known of these syndromes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurofibromatosis type 1 &ndash; Associated with germline mutations in <em>NF1.</em> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noonan syndrome &ndash; Associated with germline mutations in <em>PTPN11 </em>in one-half of affected children; others may have germline mutations of <em>NRAS</em> or <em>KRAS</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Noonan syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"#H1367564364\" class=\"local\">'Noonan syndrome (NS)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Germline mutations may cause a transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) that can resolve spontaneously. As an example, a TMD is diagnosed during the <span class=\"nowrap\">neonatal/early</span> infancy period in some children with Noonan syndrome (NS); this NS-associated TMD generally resolves spontaneously over several months, and close observation is an appropriate strategy for these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1367564364\" class=\"local\">'Noonan syndrome (NS)'</a> below.)</p><p>Germline mutations of other genes associated with this pathway are found in a variety of congenital or developmental disorders and may cause disease affecting other organ systems. As an example, children with germline <em>CBL</em> mutations may develop vasculopathies (eg, optic atrophy, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, arteritis) in the second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51200882\"><span class=\"h3\">Acquired JMML mutations can arise in utero</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymerase chain reaction sequencing of dried blood from Guthrie cards detected mutations of <em>PTPN11, NRAS, </em>or<em> KRAS </em>in each of seven children who were diagnosed with JMML between age 2 and 19 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These represented acquired rather than inherited mutations, but this finding suggests that the JMML clone arose before birth in these children. Others have also detected acquired oncogenic JMML mutations that arose in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It is important to make the distinction between germline and acquired mutations of these genes (ie, by comparison with nonhematopoietic tissue, such as fibroblasts) because the myeloproliferative disorder associated with some of the germline mutations may resolve spontaneously and not require hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H3367696133\" class=\"local\">'Germline RAS/MAPK pathway mutations and associated disorders'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112468143\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JMML is a rare cancer with an incidence of approximately 1.2 per million children 0 to 14 years of age per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The disease incidence is similar across several studies, and there is no clear effect of race, ethnicity, or geography on the incidence of JMML. The median age at presentation is two years (range 0.1 to 11.4) and there is a male predominance of 2 to 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome, and germline <em>CBL</em> mutations have an increased likelihood of developing JMML. For patients with NF1, the risk of JMML is about 350 times greater than children without NF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myelomonocytic-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

One-third of affected children will have an acute illness with fever, signs of upper respiratory infection, organomegaly, and cutaneous findings.
