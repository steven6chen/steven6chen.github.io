It is associated with the histopathologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). In the past, treatment was aimed at minimizing inflammation and slowing the progression from inflammation to fibrosis. However, the underlying lesion in IPF may be more fibrotic than inflammatory, explaining why few patients respond to anti-inflammatory therapies and the prognosis remains poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The following questions will be discussed in this topic review, although considerable uncertainty remains about the answers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which patients should be treated?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When should therapy be started?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the best therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the disease course and the response to treatment be monitored?</p><p/><p>The evaluation, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of IPF are presented separately.

The diagnosis of IPF may be established with a high degree of confidence in patients with a compatible clinical presentation, typical high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings (eg, subpleural, bibasilar predominance of reticular markings, honeycombing, and the absence of features inconsistent with UIP pattern, eg, ground glass opacities, micronodules, cysts, or mosaic attenuation) and no evidence of another contributing process (eg, asbestos exposure, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Finally, a disease management plan is tailored to the disease severity and desires of the individual patient. Management generally includes a combination of supportive care, use of selected medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a>), consideration for participation in clinical trials, referral for lung transplant evaluation (when appropriate), and identification and treatment of comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].

Patients usually progress from mild to moderate to severe respiratory limitation, although the rate of progression can vary over the course of the disease. The factors that influence prognosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-monitoring-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H61154306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and monitoring of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild or early disease are often asymptomatic or may have a mild, nonproductive cough and dyspnea with substantial exertion. Radiographic changes of reticular opacities and areas of honeycombing are limited to subpleural and basilar areas, involving less than 10 percent of the lung parenchyma. Pulmonary function tests may be normal or may show mild reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusing capacity (DLCO), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distance walked on the six-minute walk test. The alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient (P[A-a]O<sub>2</sub>) is normal or mildly elevated (&lt;20 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate disease is characterized by dyspnea on moderate exertion, nonproductive cough, and mild-to-moderate pulmonary function abnormalities.

Discordance in the degree of impairment of FVC and DLCO may be noted. Supplemental oxygen may be needed with exertion.

One way of assessing the extent of radiographic changes is to quantitate these radiographic abnormalities on HRCT slices taken at three levels (eg, tracheal carina, inferior pulmonary veins, and 1 cm above the dome of the diaphragm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced disease is characterized clinically by dyspnea on mild exertion (eg, walking &lt;300 feet or climbing more than one flight of stairs) and requirement for supplemental oxygen at rest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with exertion.

Pulmonary function testing typically reveals moderate to severe reductions in the FVC (&lt;50 percent of predicted), DLCO (&lt;50 percent of predicted), and oxygen desaturation (&ge;4 percent) during a six-minute walk test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Gas exchange is also impaired with room air oxygen saturation below 88 percent and elevated P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> difference (&gt;30 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2857291914\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When developing a treatment plan for each patient, it is helpful to have an estimate of prognosis. The most widely validated clinical prediction model is the Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) model, which incorporates age, gender, FVC, and DLCO into a simple point-score index and staging system predictive of one, two, and three-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The GAP index and staging system, combined with clinical impression, can be used to guide initial patient discussions regarding prognosis, therapeutic options, urgency of lung transplantation, and timeline of palliative approaches. The GAP system is described in greater detail separately.

This study showed an acceptable safety profile. A subset of patients (about one in five) showed some benefit from treatment. Unfortunately, none of the patient-related outcome measures showed any benefit. Confirmation of the potential benefit of FG-3019 will require randomized, placebo-controlled, phase <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13191846\"><span class=\"h2\">Imatinib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), c-kit, and c-Abl.

The effect of thalidomide on cough, a debilitating symptom in IPF, was assessed in 23 patients with IPF who were randomly assigned to thalidomide or placebo in a 24-week crossover trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Twenty-two participants completed 12 weeks of the placebo regimen, and 20 completed 12 weeks of thalidomide. The primary endpoint, improvement in the Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), favored thalidomide (mean difference versus placebo, -11.4 [95% CI, -15.7 to -7.0]). Cough severity measured on a visual analog scale also improved. Adverse events attributed to thalidomide included constipation (36 percent), dizziness (27 percent), malaise 14 percent, anorexia (5 percent) and asymptomatic bradycardia (5 percent). The potential benefit of thalidomide in IPF will need validation in a larger and longer multicenter trial that assesses additional endpoints, such as mortality and lung function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28689292\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunomodulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is still much to be learned regarding the roles of various cytokines and growth factors in the complex process of pulmonary fibrosis, it is clear that these agents are critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/148,149,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149,156</a>]. Inhibitors of specific fibrogenic cytokines or growth factors (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], anti-CD 11 antibody) may help to retard the fibrotic process. Although these agents may appear to be effective in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, it will be important to evaluate them fully in randomized, placebo-controlled trials in humans. Another potential strategy involves interfering with the process of leukocyte recruitment and retention in the lung by using agents that block the expression or function of adhesion molecules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of fibrosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28689299\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux and chronic microaspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 90 percent of patients with IPF have gastroesophageal reflux (GER) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/157-159\" class=\"abstract_t\">157-159</a>]. It has been hypothesized that GER is an important risk factor for the development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression of IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/160-164\" class=\"abstract_t\">160-164</a>]. In a systematic review, it was noted that 67 to 76 percent of patients with IPF assessed with ambulatory pH probe monitoring had abnormal distal esophageal acid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. In addition, classic symptoms of GER (heartburn, acid regurgitation) were poor predictors of increased esophageal acid exposure among patients with moderate to severe IPF. In a separate study, reflux in patients with IPF was associated with a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter and abnormal esophageal peristalsis, and often extended into the proximal esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].</p><p>The effect of anti-GER treatment on IPF disease progression has also been examined. A retrospective study of 204 patients with IPF found that reported use of anti-GER medications was associated with decreased radiographic fibrosis scores on chest computed tomography and was an independent predictor of longer survival time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. An analysis of data from three randomized controlled trials identified patients with IPF assigned to receive placebo and used prospectively obtained data about diagnosis and treatment of abnormal acid gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Of the 242 patients randomly assigned to the placebo groups of the three trials, 124 (51 percent) were taking a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker at enrollment. After adjustment for sex, baseline FVC as a percentage of predicted, and baseline diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) as a percentage of predicted, patients taking a PPI or H2 blocker at baseline had a smaller decrease in FVC at 30 weeks (-0.06 L, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.01) than those not taking anti-acid treatment (-0.12 L, -0.17 to -0.08; difference 0&middot;07 L, 95% CI 0-0.14). These data suggest that anti-GER treatment could be beneficial in patients with IPF and support the previous reports suggesting that abnormal acid gastroesophageal reflux contributes to disease progression. However, controlled clinical trials of acid reflux treatments in IPF are needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
