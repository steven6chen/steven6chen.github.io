Patients deceptively misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of an illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injury in themselves, even in the absence of obvious external rewards such as financial gain, housing, or medications. Factitious disorder imposed on self is distinguished from factitious disorder imposed on another, such as a child or older adult.

The developmental perspective posits that the abnormal illness behaviors begin in childhood as a mechanism for coping with stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is hypothesized that the sick role behavior associated with factitious disorder is a means of establishing or stabilizing one's identity, maintaining relationships with others, and addressing emotional dysregulation and unmet needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>]. Chronic illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization may provide patients with benefits that are otherwise unavailable in more conventional social settings such as the workplace; these benefits include a clear role and sense of importance and belonging, and concern and acceptance by others. A study of comments posted by members of online support groups for individuals who self-identified as having factitious disorder found that receiving affection was the most frequently cited motivation for occupying the sick role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another proposed motivation is that patients may enjoy duping clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurocognition</strong> &ndash; Factitious disorder may be associated with dysfunction in the right hemisphere of the brain.

Patients may also become disruptive or physically threatening. (See <a href=\"#H187276329\" class=\"local\">'Discussing the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with factitious disorder imposed on self use a number of techniques to disrupt the clinician's standard practices. They may exploit the clinician's fear of missing a rare life-threatening disease, play into the clinician's fascination of solving a medical mystery, or convince the clinician that it would be redundant to conduct basic, definitive diagnostic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Multiple clinicians often simultaneously care for a patient with factitious disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients may behave in such a way as to &quot;split&quot; the treatment team, pitting different clinicians against each other.</p><p>Factitious disorder imposed on self is frequently comorbid with depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A retrospective study of patients with factitious disorder (n = 93) found that psychiatric comorbidity was present in more than 30 percent, and a history of physical or sexual abuse was reported by more than 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In addition, factitious disorder can be comorbid with true general medical conditions, including the condition that is feigned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, patients with diabetes may manipulate blood glucose measurements to mislead clinicians and appear more ill than is actually the case.</p><p>Factitious disorder imposed on self may overlap co-occur with factitious disorder imposed on another, such that some patients falsify illness in both themselves and others. Factitious disorder imposed on another, such as a child, is discussed separately.

In addition, collateral information from family or friends as well as other records can be useful. Although laboratory tests can provide definitive evidence of factitious behavior, there is no specific diagnostic test for factitious disorder, and it is important to consider the reliability and validity of the medical tests that are performed.</p><p>The diagnosis of factitious disorder requires the presence of falsified general medical or psychological symptoms.

Alternatively, suggestive evidence (eg, syringe or medication), which was not left by nursing staff, is found in the patient's room. Permission to conduct room searches is often part of the consent form patients sign before hospital admission. Inconsistent and abnormal clinical findings may cease if the patient is constantly observed by a member of the nursing staff.

Although some of the ICD-10 criteria overlap with the DSM-5 criteria (eg, patients repeatedly feign symptoms for no obvious reason and may produce symptoms or signs of an illness by inflicting self-harm), ICD-10 also includes motivation to adopt the sick role as a criterion, which is based upon inference rather than objective findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368608779\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on self includes malingering and the following disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39001766\"><span class=\"h2\">Malingering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malingering and factitious disorder are both characterized by deceptive behavior to simulate an illness. However, malingering is defined as illness falsification to obtain obvious external benefits such as money, medications (eg, opioids or benzodiazepines), time off work, child custody, or avoiding criminal prosecution, whereas the deception observed in factitious disorder is not fully accounted for by external rewards. In addition, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (especially those that are painful or invasive) are avoided in malingering but readily accepted in factitious disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If malingering and factitious disorder are comorbid, diagnosing factitious disorder requires clinicians to determine that the patient is taking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms beyond what one would expect in order to obtain external rewards.

However, in conversion disorder there is no evidence of deceptive behaviors or falsification of symptoms, whereas factitious disorder is characterized by evidence of deception and falsification. In addition, conversion disorder always involves symptoms related to the nervous system; factitious disorder can manifest with symptoms involving any organ system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345714193\"><span class=\"h2\">Delusional disorder, somatic type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with delusional disorder, somatic type, and patients with factitious disorder may both manifest symptoms that are not supported by objective evidence.

The most common falsified symptoms and diseases include abdominal pain, arthralgia, chest pain, coagulopathy, diarrhea, hematuria, hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, hypoglycemia, infections, seizures, skin wounds that do not heal, vomiting, and weakness. Patients may feign symptoms and illnesses by fabricating symptoms; inducing illnesses; aggravating genuine, existing illness by not adhering to medical recommendations; tampering with medical instruments, tests, or laboratory specimens; and forging medical records. The usual course of illness appears to be one of intermittent episodes, and long-term recovery is rare. (See <a href=\"#H368608761\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of patients who may have factitious disorder imposed on self includes a general medical and psychiatric history, physical and mental status examination, and analysis of the medical record. In addition, collateral information from family or friends as well as other records can be useful. In analyzing past medical records, it is helpful to summarize the medical contacts with a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F97624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97624 \">table 2</a>). Also, the diagnosis of factitious disorder is often established with laboratory data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F97625\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97625 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H121099183\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of factitious disorder imposed on self is suggested by several clues, including high rates of healthcare utilization; evasiveness in providing history; refusal to grant access to prior medical records; inconsistencies in the history, examination, and laboratory tests; lengthy and extensive clinical evaluation that is negative; and poor response to standard treatments for the disease in question. (See <a href=\"#H121098991\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect factitious disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on self requires each of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury or disease, associated with identified deception</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The individual presents himself or herself to others as ill, impaired, or injured</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as delusional disorder or another psychotic disorder&quot;</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"#H121098997\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of factitious disorder includes malingering, general medical and mental disorders, borderline personality disorder, conversion disorder, delusional disorder, and somatic symptom disorder. (See <a href=\"#H368608779\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on self is presented to patients by providing accurate and compassionate feedback about the clinical findings. (See <a href=\"#H187276329\" class=\"local\">'Discussing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with factitious disorder imposed on self, we suggest psychotherapy as first-line treatment, rather than pharmacotherapy or no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H143289\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for factitious disorder imposed on self is poor. (See <a href=\"#H142410\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factitious disorder imposed on another, such as a child or older adult, is a form of abuse.
