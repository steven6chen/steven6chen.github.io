Agents in this class inhibit the breakdown of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and other incretins. Thus, their biological effects are similar, but not identical, to those of GLP-1 agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a> is approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is little published long-term information about its clinical effects and side effects. Like the GLP-1 agonists, the DPP-4 inhibitors are indicated for patients with type 2 diabetes but not those with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Unlike the GLP-1 agonists, the DPP-4 inhibitors are given orally. A dose adjustment is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> (a serum creatinine &gt;1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [150 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in men and &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in women). They are expensive. In postmarketing reports, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a> has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and blistering skin conditions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It has also been associated with acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H1203032\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Candidates'</a>.)</p><p>The FDA issued an alert about a possible association of incretin-based drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a> (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>) with acute pancreatitis based upon a review of 30 postmarketing reports, in some of which a causal relationship between these agents and acute pancreatitis was suspected. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency now agree that there is insufficient evidence to confirm an increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with the use of GLP-1 based therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-17-a-57-year-old-woman-with-newly-discovered-type-2-diabetes-a5/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pancreatitis continues to be considered a risk associated with these drugs. Concerns remain, and monitoring for and reporting of pancreatic adverse effects continues.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sitagliptin</a> has not been shown to be superior to any other single pharmacologic agent in a direct comparison. Because of its high cost and the poorly defined potential for serious and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, sitagliptin cannot be recommended as the initial pharmacologic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes. It may have an occasional role as a third oral agent in patients with a modest increase in the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level who cannot or will not take insulin, when full doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> and a sulfonylurea have not produced satisfactory metabolic control.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
