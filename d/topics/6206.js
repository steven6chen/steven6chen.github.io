NAFLD may progress to cirrhosis and is likely an important cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of NAFLD. The pathogenesis, natural history, and treatment of NAFLD are discussed separately.

In addition, no secondary causes of hepatic steatosis are present. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>NAFLD is subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NAFL, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of significant inflammation, whereas in NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic inflammation that may be histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic steatohepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Other terms that have been used to describe NASH include pseudoalcoholic hepatitis, alcohol-like hepatitis, fatty liver hepatitis, steatonecrosis, and diabetic hepatitis.

This is supported by the findings from a subsequent study from NHANES that used ultrasound data collected from patients between 1988 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In that study, the age-adjusted prevalence of NAFLD was estimated to be 19 percent. A third study that used a fatty liver index estimated that the prevalence of NAFLD between 2011 and 2012 was 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The fatty liver index was derived to predict ultrasound-diagnosed fatty liver and took into account fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations, body mass index, sex, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242879720\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient demographics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients are diagnosed with NAFLD in their 40s or 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies vary with regard to the sex distribution of NAFLD, with some suggesting it is more common in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-21</a>] and others suggesting it is more common in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,11,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,22-25</a>]. </p><p>There appear to be ethnic differences in the prevalence of NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,26</a>]. A study of hepatic triglyceride content in 2287 subjects from a US multiethnic, population-based sample found a higher prevalence of hepatic steatosis in Hispanics (45 percent) compared with whites (33 percent) or blacks (24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Liver biopsies were performed in 163 patients and revealed NASH in 120 (74 percent). Metabolic syndrome was seen in 53 percent of patients who did not undergo biopsy, in 67 percent of those with simple steatosis (NAFL) on biopsy, and in 88 percent of those with NASH on biopsy. After correcting for age, sex, and body mass index, metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of severe fibrosis (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.2).</p><p>While the metabolic syndrome is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is common in patients with NAFLD, NAFLD may be independently associated with cardiovascular disease. In a study using data from NHANES, NAFLD was associated with cardiovascular disease after controlling for older age, male sex, obesity, type 2 diabetes, smoking, and family history of early myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.04-1.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the study did not control for dyslipidemia or systemic hypertension, which could act as confounders, since hyperlipidemia is associated with both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>There are also data that suggest NAFLD is associated with cholecystectomy. This was examined using a group of 12,232 participants in a population-based survey from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After controlling for factors such as age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, and cholesterol levels, patients who underwent cholecystectomy were more than twice as likely to have NAFLD than those who had not undergone cholecystectomy (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-3.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An increased prevalence of NAFLD was not seen in patients with gallstones who had not undergone cholecystectomy.</p><p>Other conditions that have been associated with NAFLD, independent of their associations with obesity, include polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, hypopituitarism, and hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Currently, screening for NAFLD is not recommended for patients at increased risk.

The most widely supported theory implicates insulin resistance as the key mechanism leading to hepatic steatosis, and perhaps also to steatohepatitis. Others have proposed that a &quot;second hit&quot;, or additional oxidative injury, is required to manifest the necroinflammatory component of steatohepatitis. Hepatic iron, leptin, antioxidant deficiencies, and intestinal bacteria have all been suggested as potential oxidative stressors.

In some patients, hepatomegaly is the presenting sign of NAFLD. The reported prevalence of hepatomegaly in patients with NAFLD is highly variable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study of 1168 participants from Mumbai, NAFLD was detected in 9 percent (19 percent of those older than 20 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, the study did not differentiate between patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver and those with NASH, and as suggested by the third study, it is possible that hepatomegaly is more prevalent in patients with more advanced disease.</p><p>Patients who have developed cirrhosis may have stigmata of chronic liver disease (eg, palmar erythema, spider angiomata, ascites).

The true prevalence of abnormal transaminases among patients with NAFLD is unclear, since many patients with NAFLD are diagnosed because they are noted to have abnormal aminotransferases. When elevated, the AST and ALT are typically two to five times the upper limit of normal, with an AST to ALT ratio of less than one (unlike alcoholic fatty liver disease, which typically has a ratio greater than two) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/14,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,43-45</a>]. The degree of aminotransferase elevation does not predict the degree of hepatic inflammation or fibrosis, and a normal alanine aminotransferase does not exclude clinically important histologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/22,32,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32,40</a>].

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines do not recommend screening because there are uncertainties around which diagnostic test to use (since liver enzyme levels may be normal in patients with NAFLD), how to treat NAFLD if discovered, and whether screening is cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

NAFLD may progress to cirrhosis and is likely an important cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NAFLD is subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NAFL, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of significant inflammation, whereas in NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic inflammation that may be histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic steatohepatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic, although some patients with NASH may complain of fatigue, malaise, and vague right upper abdominal discomfort. Patients are more likely to come to attention because laboratory testing revealed elevated liver aminotransferases or hepatic steatosis was detected incidentally on abdominal imaging. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with NAFLD may have mild or moderate elevations in the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, although normal aminotransferase levels do not exclude NAFLD. (See <a href=\"#H19331440\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic findings in patients with NAFLD include increased echogenicity on ultrasound, decreased hepatic attenuation on computed tomography, or an increased fat signal on magnetic resonance imaging. (See <a href=\"#H19331447\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of NAFLD requires all of the following (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Demonstration of hepatic steatosis by imaging or biopsy </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exclusion of significant alcohol consumption </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of coexisting chronic liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of hepatic steatosis include (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant alcohol use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatitis C (particularly genotype 3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wilson disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lipodystrophy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Starvation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral nutrition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abetalipoproteinemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reye syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HELLP (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inborn errors of metabolism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiologic findings are often sufficient to make a diagnosis of NAFLD, provided other causes of hepatic steatosis have been excluded.
