Hives are raised areas of the skin that itch intensely and are red with a pale center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>). Hives are a very common condition. About 20 percent of people have hives at some time during their lives.</p><p>Hives develop when there is a reaction that activates immune cells in the skin called mast cells. When activated, these cells release natural chemicals. One important chemical is histamine, which causes itching, redness, and swelling of the skin in an area: a hive. In most cases, hives appear suddenly and disappear within several hours.</p><p>Hives usually respond well to treatment, which includes medicines and avoiding whatever triggered the hives.</p><p>More detailed information about hives is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset urticaria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HIVES SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hives are raised areas that itch intensely and are sometimes red with a pale center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>). In some cases, the raised areas enlarge and merge together (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51694\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51694 \">picture 2</a>). Itching is usually the most bothersome symptom of hives, and it may be severe enough to interfere with work and sleep.</p><p>Severe pain, blood blister-like spots, and bruising of the skin are <strong>NOT</strong> typical of hives. Having hives along with a fever and joint pains is also NOT typical. These symptoms suggest a different condition called urticarial vasculitis, which requires a different treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In up to one-half of people with hives, a condition called angioedema also develops. Angioedema is similar to hives, but occurs in the deeper layers of skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of angioedema include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puffiness of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, feet, and genitalia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling that usually affects one side of the body or affects one side more than the other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sensation of fullness or discomfort in the area of the swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slight redness of the skin, although the skin may also be normal in color</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hives as part of a serious allergic reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hives can also occur as part of a more serious allergic reaction. You should see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you develop hives or angioedema suddenly, along with other symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tightness in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramping abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hives are classified based upon how long you have the hives. Hives can be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute (brief)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic (long-standing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical (triggered by certain types of physical stimulation, such as heat, cold, or sun exposure)</p><p/><p>Of course, when you first get hives, you cannot tell how long they will last, and so you cannot tell if you have acute or chronic hives.</p><p>Although all types of hives look similar, they often have different triggers. Learning what triggers your hives can help you to avoid the trigger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of hives are acute and will not last beyond a few days to a week or two. Triggers of acute hives can include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; Infections can cause hives in some people. In fact, viral infections cause more than 80 percent of all cases of acute hives in children. A variety of viruses can cause hives (even routine cold viruses). The hives seem to appear as the immune system begins to clear the infection, sometimes a week or more after the illness begins. The hives usually persist for a week or two and then disappear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs &ndash; Many types of drugs can trigger hives, including antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-penicillin-and-related-antibiotics-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergy to penicillin and related antibiotics (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Painkillers (eg, codeine and morphine), muscle relaxants used in anesthesia, and intravenous (IV) contrast dye used in imaging procedures can also trigger hives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insect stings &ndash; Stings from certain insects (bees, wasps, hornets, fire ants) can cause hives around the area of the sting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-and-insect-stings-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Bee and insect stings (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imported-fire-ants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Imported fire ants (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you get hives all over your body after an insect sting, this may be a sign of a more serious reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis must be treated as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food allergies &ndash; Food allergy can cause acute hives in some people. Food-associated hives typically appear within 30 minutes of eating the food. The foods most likely to cause hives in children include milk, eggs, peanuts, other nuts, soy, and wheat. The foods most likely to cause hives in adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and other nuts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical contact &ndash; Hives can occur after you touch certain substances if you are allergic to them. For example, children who are allergic to dogs may get hives if a dog licks them. Other things that can cause hives (if you are allergic) include plants, raw fruits and vegetables, and latex (found in balloons, latex gloves, condoms, and other common items).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic hives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hives occur daily or almost daily and last longer than six weeks, sometimes for years. Chronic hives can be frustrating because they come and go and can interfere with sleep, work, or school. Hives affect how you look and people may worry about being near you for fear that you have a contagious infection.</p><p>However, it is important to remember that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives are not contagious</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic hives are rarely permanent; almost 50 percent of people are hive-free within one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic hives are rarely caused by allergies and are not life-threatening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bothersome symptoms of chronic hives are treatable in most people</p><p/><p>In most cases of chronic hives, the cause is unknown. Researchers suspect that problems in the immune system play a role.</p><p>Hives can be a sign of several other medical or autoimmune conditions, including thyroid or liver diseases, chronic infections, or lupus. Most people with one of these conditions will have other symptoms, apart from the hives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical hives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hives can be triggered by a variety of physical factors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to cold &ndash; The hives often appear as the cold skin warms again. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in body temperature or sweating &ndash; These hives are often tiny and numerous and appear on reddened skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vibration &ndash; Palms may become red, swollen, and itchy after holding onto the steering wheel of a car while driving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure &ndash; Hives on the palms or the soles of the feet can occur hours after carrying heavy objects or walking long distances. Because the skin on the palms and soles is thick, these areas may appear reddened and swollen without clear hives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Hives that appear during exercise can be a sign of a dangerous condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunlight or water &ndash; This is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Finally, there is a common condition called dermographism (literally &quot;skin writing&quot;). People with this condition develop reddened, raised lines if the skin is stroked firmly or scratched.</p><p>Physical forms of hives tend to be long-lasting and are considered a type of chronic hives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HIVES TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hives do not need any testing. The diagnosis is usually based on their symptoms and a physical examination. However, tests may be recommended if hives do not resolve within six weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing for food and drug sensitivities may be recommended if there are concerns about allergies as a cause of symptoms. This is usually done for people with acute hives. Chronic hives are rarely caused by an allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood tests are sometimes done if hives continue for several weeks. Blood tests can tell if there are signs of underlying diseases, such as liver or thyroid problems or an autoimmune disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin biopsy (when a small sample of skin is removed) may help identify uncommon causes of hives. A skin biopsy may be recommended for people who have chronic hives along with other symptoms, such as persistent fever, painful hives, individual hives that last for days at a time, or hives associated with bruising of the skin. A skin biopsy may also be recommended for people who have other symptoms or abnormal blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">HIVES TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hives are treated with a combination of avoiding things that cause or worsen the hives, plus the use of medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first treatment for hives is to figure out what is triggering the hives and then avoid that trigger. Even if you cannot figure out the trigger, hives usually disappear over days or weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihistamines are medicines that can relieve itching. Most people with hives respond to antihistamines. You may need a relatively high dose or more than one type of antihistamine to control your symptoms.</p><p>There are two main types of antihistamines. They differ in side effects, cost, how long the medicine lasts, and need for a prescription.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older antihistamines &ndash; Older antihistamines start to work quickly and work well to relieve symptoms. The problem with older antihistamines is that you have to take a dose four to six times per day, and many people have bothersome side effects. These can include drowsiness, dry mouth, double or blurred vision, or difficulty urinating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some of these side effects interfere with driving and tasks requiring quick reactions, similar to the effects of drinking alcohol. These medicines are therefore not recommended for people who plan to drive, pilot aircrafts or boats, or operate heavy machinery, or for people whose job performance may be otherwise affected. Starting the medicine at a low dose and gradually increasing the dose can help to ease side effects. The side effects usually get better if you take the medicine regularly over a period of days to weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The older antihistamines include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diphenhydramine (Benadryl and others)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton and others) &ndash; Chlorpheniramine appears to be safe in pregnant women</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril, requires prescription)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cyproheptadine (Periactin, requires prescription)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer antihistamines &ndash; Newer antihistamines have fewer side effects than older antihistamines. Also, newer antihistamines have to be taken less often, usually once or twice per day. Examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loratadine (Claritin and generic)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cetirizine (Zyrtec and generic)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fexofenadine (Allegra and generic)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Desloratadine (Clarinex, requires prescription)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Levocetirizine (Xyzal, requires prescription)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other antihistamines &ndash; There is another type of antihistamine that is commonly used to treat heartburn. Your doctor or nurse might recommend one of these medicines in combination with another antihistamine, if one medicine alone does not work for you. Examples of this type of antihistamine include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ranitidine (Zantac)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nizatidine (Axid)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Famotidine (Pepcid)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cimetidine (Tagamet)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doxepin &ndash; Doxepin (Sinequan) can sometimes relieve hives that do not respond to other treatments. However, doxepin causes significant drowsiness and is not recommended when driving or working. Doxepin is sometimes taken at bedtime to help people with severe hives get a better night's sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ketotifen &ndash; Ketotifen is a medicine sometimes used to treat hives. Ketotifen is not available in the United States in pill form, but has been used for many years in Canada, Japan, and Europe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high dose of antihistamines is usually recommended before trying other treatments. However, oral steroids (glucocorticoids), such as prednisone, can help to relieve severe acute hives that do not get better with antihistamines. Once the hives have improved, the steroid dose is gradually lowered and then stopped.</p><p>Oral steroids may be used temporarily to relieve chronic hives, but they should not be used for long-term treatment. This is because steroids can have serious side effects when taken for long periods of time (months or years). If you are taking oral steroids for more than a month or two per year to control your hives, you should see a specialist (an allergist or a dermatologist).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your hives do not get better with the treatments discussed above, other treatments are available. One example is montelukast, a medicine that helps with itching and hives in some people when used together with antihistamines. If your hives are not responding to the treatments you have been offered, you should see a specialist (an allergist or a dermatologist).</p><p>More detailed information about hives is available by subscription.
