Transplantation of a living-donor kidney is an elective surgical procedure. Potential recipients are evaluated at a preoperative outpatient clinic prior to hospital admission so that the outpatient nephrologist can ensure optimal patient condition before surgery.</p><p>In contrast with living-donor kidney transplantation, transplantation of a deceased-donor kidney is a relatively urgent procedure (because of the time-limited viability of the donated kidney) performed in an elective population. Although patients on deceased-donor waiting lists are maintained medically cleared for transplant at all times, preoperative re-evaluation is performed in the hospital shortly before transplantation.</p><p>Further information regarding preoperative considerations in transplant recipients is available in other topics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient#H255110068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Timing of transplantation referral'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy#H1212465762\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation in diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pre-emptive transplantation and living-donor versus deceased kidneys'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The kidney transplant waiting list in the United States&quot;, section on 'Health care of transplant candidates'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095745092\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing need for preoperative dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding possible need for preoperative dialysis depend in part on whether the patient has been chronically dependent on maintenance dialysis, as well as whether hyperkalemia or volume overload is present. If possible, dialysis should be avoided for 24 hours prior to renal transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation#H260397680\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Dialysis immediately before transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>If hemodialysis is necessary on the day of surgery, we use heparin-free dialysis to avoid intraoperative coagulopathy. If heparin has been used for any reason, we wait three to four hours for the coagulation profile to return to normal, if possible, since the half-life of heparin is 90 minutes. We check that the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) has normalized (&lt;45 seconds) at the time of surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of the dialysis patient undergoing surgery&quot;, section on 'Heparin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nondialysis patients</strong> &ndash; Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are awaiting a living-donor kidney transplantation are often not on maintenance dialysis even though they have significant kidney dysfunction. Such patients are closely followed by a nephrologist (eg, monthly, if not more frequently) to detect any indication to start dialysis. However, dialysis is avoided if possible since preemptive transplantation performed in patients who have not had prior dialysis is associated with better outcomes than transplantation performed in patients receiving chronic dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation#H1897839493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Preemptive transplantation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In rare cases, a nondialysis patient will have an indication for preoperative dialysis shortly before transplantation (typically hyperkalemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume overload). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dialysis patients</strong> &ndash; Patients awaiting deceased-donor kidney transplantation are typically receiving chronic maintenance dialysis to treat their ESRD, and may have been on the transplant wait list for a prolonged period. Such patients have usually received dialysis within 48 to 72 hours of hospital admission for transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2070918191\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild hyperkalemia at baseline is common among patients with ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If serum potassium is &ge;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> we employ dialysis if possible. In a chronically dialyzed patient, a usable dialysis access site is typically available. If there is no functioning dialysis access, we place a temporary catheter to provide dialysis prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery#H649594496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of the dialysis patient undergoing surgery&quot;, section on 'Hyperkalemia'</a>.)</p><p>However, there is variability among transplant centers regarding this decision. For example, if urgent surgery is necessary in a patient with chronic hyperkalemia and the preoperative serum potassium level is &le;6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> medical therapy may be initiated in some centers, rather than delaying surgery for dialysis. This includes intravenous (IV) administration of 10 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> together with 50 mL of 50 percent glucose (ie, 25 g of glucose). A subsequent infusion of 10 percent dextrose is administered at 50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> to avoid hypoglycemia. Serum glucose should be measured one hour after administration of insulin. A beta<sub>2</sub> agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> or salbutamol) can be added to insulin-plus-glucose therapy in order to maximize reduction in serum potassium.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H6570023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Volume overload'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach depends upon whether the patient is on maintenance dialysis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nondialysis patients</strong> &ndash; If significant volume overload is present in a nondialysis patient, our initial treatment is IV loop diuretics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Intravenous therapy'</a>). If diuretic therapy is not effective, dialysis may be employed to remove fluid. In patients with no other indications for dialysis (eg, hyperkalemia), isolated ultrafiltration may be used to remove excess fluid rather than dialysis with ultrafiltration, but isolated ultrafiltration removes only 1 to 2 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since patients awaiting living-donor transplantation are closely followed by an outpatient nephrologist, intravascular volume status is monitored and responsiveness to diuretic therapy is generally preserved. If there is little response to diuretic administration, possible changes in clinical status (eg, worsening cardiac function) should be sought prior to transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dialysis patients</strong> &ndash; If significant volume overload is present in a chronically dialyzed patient, we initiate dialysis before transplantation when feasible, rather than attempting a trial of diuretic therapy. Chronic dialysis patients are frequently anuric and therefore are not likely to respond to treatment with diuretics. Isolated ultrafiltration may be used to remove an appropriate amount of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Excessive peripheral edema in a chronically-dialyzed patient may be an indication of the subacute onset of heart failure, and should prompt evaluation for its presence (typically echocardiography) and possible causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Heart failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p>We avoid excessive ultrafiltration if hemodialysis is necessary for fluid removal on the day of surgery, since this may result in excessive intravascular volume depletion and consequent risk of intraoperative hypotension. We target a post-dialysis weight that is 1 to 2 L above the patient's usual target &quot;dry weight,&quot; which is established by the outpatient nephrologist and documented on the outpatient dialysis chart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3682448786\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ESRD, particularly those who require chronic dialysis, typically have multisystem comorbidities mediated by the primary disease process causing renal failure (eg, diabetes, hypertension) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by the adverse effects of chronic renal disease and dialysis. These include cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary arterial, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease; heart failure; valvular heart disease; pulmonary hypertension; atrial fibrillation), anemia, coagulation abnormalities, gastrointestinal disorders, or osteodystrophy. In particular, preoperative frailty is associated with increased mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Conversely, patients scheduled to receive a living-donor transplant are typically not on dialysis and may be relatively healthy without uremic symptoms and with few comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment for any signs or symptoms of active infection is particularly important in any transplant recipient.

Available laboratory tests typically include a complete blood count, PTT and international normalized ratio (INR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, liver function tests, fasting lipid panel, uric acid, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, urinalysis, and pregnancy test for potentially fertile women. Patients with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease often have one or more pretransplant echocardiography studies in their record. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient#H119947167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, blood type compatibility and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing are performed. We routinely order crossmatching of 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) since significant blood loss is a possibility in any surgical procedure involving ligation and reanastomosis of major blood vessels. However, blood loss is usually only 150 mL. Thus, these RBC units remain in the blood bank, rather than being immediately available in the operating room.</p><p>Other specialized tests are ordered in selected patients, as discussed in detail elsewhere.

In such patients, we administer an oral nonparticulate antacid (eg, sodium citrate 500 mg in 15 mL) and an IV histamine<sub>2</sub> blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV) to reduce gastric pH. We do not routinely administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>. However, in ESRD patients with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, some clinicians do administer metoclopramide 10 to 20 mg IV at least 20 minutes prior to anesthetic induction in an attempt to reduce gastric volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The extraperitoneal iliac fossa is developed and the external iliac artery and vein are identified and mobilized. Heparin may be administered before clamping of venous or arterial vessels.</p><p>The allograft is positioned, and its renal vein is anastomosed to the external iliac vein. After its renal artery is anastomosed to the external iliac artery, the allograft is reperfused. The bladder is filled with an antibiotic irrigation solution, and a ureter-to-bladder anastomosis is performed. Finally, the wound is closed, with the native kidneys left in place. Procedure duration is usually between 1.5 and 3 hours.</p><p>Some surgeons prefer to stent the ureteroneocystostomy to minimize the risk of leak or stenosis. When a stent is used, it is generally left in place for four to six weeks and is removed via cystoscopy. Other surgeons tie a suture to the stent and Foley catheter, with subsequent removal of both just before discharge from the hospital.</p><p>Further details can be found in other topics.

Some institutions employ a higher dose of cefazolin&nbsp;(eg, 2 g in patients weighing &lt;100 kg or 3 g in those weighing &gt;100 kg). Generally, 24 hours or less of a broad-spectrum antibiotic provides adequate protection for renal transplantation in the absence of specific microbiologic data that would require broader coverage.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-temperature-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative temperature management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During robotic kidney transplantation, a &quot;regional hypothermia&quot; technique is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The pelvic bed is lined with ice slush to achieve pelvic-bed cooling. This regional hypothermia results in a decrease in the core temperature of 0.7 to 1.2&deg;C. Subsequent rewarming can cause vasodilation, fluid redistribution, hypotension, decreased central venous pressure, and decreased graft perfusion. If the anastomosis time is kept in a 30 to 40 minute range, intraoperative cooling of the graft may not be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-renal-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5641939\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal reperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After vascular anastomoses are completed, we carefully maintain adequate BP (typically MAP 70 to 90 mmHg) and avoid hypotension during renal reperfusion. If baseline MAP was high in a patient with chronic hypertension (eg, &gt;90 to 100 mmHg), we maintain MAP &gt;90 mmHg after reperfusion of the allograft. (See <a href=\"#H539775339\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension#H3945241279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with hypertension&quot;, section on 'Determination of target blood pressure values'</a>.)</p><p>Also, we ensure maintenance of adequate intravascular volume by administering fluid in 250 mL increments if respiratory variations in intra-arterial pressure waveform parameters are &gt;15 percent indicating fluid responsiveness, and by maintaining CVP at 8 to 12 mmHg. More aggressive volume resuscitation may be necessary if significant surgical bleeding occurs (eg, from a vascular anastomosis when vascular clamps are released).

These include cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary arterial, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease; valvular heart disease; heart failure; pulmonary hypertension; atrial fibrillation), anemia, coagulation abnormalities, gastrointestinal disorders, or osteodystrophy. Conversely, patients scheduled to receive a living-donor transplant are typically not on dialysis and may be relatively healthy without uremic symptoms and with few comorbidities.

We reduce and titrate the propofol dose in patients who may be hypovolemic since a standard induction dose administered as a bolus may result in profound hypotension due to venous and arterial dilation. In most patients, we also administer adjuvant medications to blunt tachycardia due to the sympathetic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> as well as a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA). If rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) is necessary, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (SCh) can be safely used as the NMBA to facilitate laryngoscopy if potassium concentration is &lt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

Five percent albumin may be administered to replace blood loss on a 1:1 volume basis until a transfusion threshold is met, although we limit total albumin to &le;500 mL.
