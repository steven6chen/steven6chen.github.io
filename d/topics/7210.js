When used to treat psychiatric diseases, they also aid in restructuring disordered thinking.</p><p>Antipsychotic medications are also used to treat a number of nonpsychiatric conditions, including nausea and vomiting (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>), vertigo (prochlorperazine, droperidol), itching (promethazine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>), migraine headache (prochlorperazine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, droperidol), Tourette's syndrome (haloperidol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>), postherpetic neuralgia (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>), and hiccups (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>).</p><p>Typical antipsychotic medications were first used clinically in 1951. Although their use in psychiatric disorders has been outpaced by that of atypical antipsychotic agents, they remain widely used to treat nausea. Poisoning and overdose from these drugs remains common. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that approximately 5800 patients are treated in US emergency departments annually for adverse effects from typical antipsychotic medication, including unintentional overdose, a rate of 26 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Haloperidol</a> was responsible for a higher rate of ED visits (43.3 per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits) than any other psychiatric medication. In 2014, American poison control centers reported more than 4600 exposures to phenothiazines, resulting in one death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Antipsychotic medications are generally categorized as &quot;low potency,&quot; &quot;high potency,&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot; agents. This topic review will discuss the management of typical, high, and low potency antipsychotic medication poisoning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60456 \">table 1</a>). A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64216 \">table 2</a>). Poisoning from atypical antipsychotic agents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-atypical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical antipsychotic agents antagonize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> (D) receptors in several areas of the brain, including the cortex, basal ganglia, limbic system, hypothalamus, and chemoreceptor trigger zone. The efficacy and potency of these agents is directly related to D2 receptor binding affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, not all forms of D2 receptor blockade are desirable. D2 antagonism in the mesocortical regions impairs cognition and exacerbates the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as avolition, anhedonia, poverty of speech, flattened affect, and social withdrawal.</p><p>The typical antipsychotic agents also block a variety of other central and peripheral nervous system receptors. Blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors may cause dry mouth, tachycardia, sedation, and constipation, and can provoke episodes of urinary retention and angle-closure glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonism can cause orthostatic hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Histamine-1 receptor antagonism contributes to sedation.</p><p>Antipsychotic agents can also affect cardiac ion channels. Most typical antipsychotics block the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG, now more commonly referred to as KCNH2) channel, reducing the delayed inward potassium rectifier potassium current (IKr) and prolonging cardiac repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is manifest on the electrocardiogram as QT interval prolongation, and in extreme cases, this can lead to torsades de pointes (TdP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Although this effect is most pronounced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioridazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioridazine</a>, many other antipsychotic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>, and sertindole, have been associated with QT prolongation and TdP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>QRS prolongation may occur due to antipsychotic medication-induced sodium channel blockade, particularly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioridazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioridazine</a> and mesoridazine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>]. Several antipsychotic medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, block L-type calcium channels, but the relevance of this for human exposures is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Acute extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), such as acute dystonic reactions and akathisia, appear to be related to an imbalance between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> (presumably D2) receptor antagonism and muscarinic (presumably M1) receptor antagonism in the CNS. Medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>, which have a high <span class=\"nowrap\">D2/M1</span> receptor affinity ratio, are the most likely to cause EPS; M1 receptor antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a>, and the dopamine agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> are equally effective remedies for acute EPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Although the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has long been thought to be a centrally mediated phenomenon, some evidence suggests that antipsychotic medications directly affect skeletal muscle mitochondria, possibly uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antipsychotic medications are associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, including cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and with venous thromboembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. It is unclear whether this is a result of the medications themselves or the disease being treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Antipsychotic medication use is associated with an increase in seizure frequency, compared with non-use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis and massive asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation (MACKE) without rhabdomyolysis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical antipsychotic medications are absorbed quickly and enter the brain rapidly. As an example, the peak clinical effect of orally administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> occurs within two to four hours after dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In overdose, delayed peak serum concentrations can occur, particularly if anticholinergic effects delay gut motility.</p><p>Once absorbed, antipsychotic medications diffuse into lipophilic tissues; volumes of distribution (VD) are generally in the range of 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> precluding removal by hemodialysis. Elimination half-lives range from 6 to 24 hours; for each agent, the range of half-lives measured varies greatly between individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51653 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Great variability exists in the amount of drug needed to cause signs and symptoms of overdose. In general, the elderly and people who are naive to the medications become symptomatic at lower doses. While conscious patients may give a history of overdose, many patients present obtunded and any history is provided by family, friends, first responders, and pharmacists. Not all patients with antipsychotic medication overdose have a history of psychiatric illness; patients may overdose on medications obtained from family members or others.</p><p>Acute extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), such as akathisia and dystonic reactions, can occur with antipsychotic medication at any dose. The time to onset varies widely. In one emergency department case series, 44 percent of patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> for migraine headache developed akathisia within one hour of administration, while an additional 3 percent developed akathisia within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The onset of EPS appears to be more gradual following oral dosing: half of cases occur within 48 hours of initiation of the antipsychotic medication, and 90 percent occur within five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Extrapyramidal symptoms are rare in overdose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical antipsychotic poisoning does not cause any pathognomonic signs. Pupils may be miotic, normal size, or mydriatic. Portions of the anticholinergic toxidrome, such as tachycardia, mild hyperthermia, dry skin, and diminished bowel sounds may be present, but this is by no means consistent or reliable. Mild hypotension may result from alpha adrenergic blockade. Profound hyperthermia suggests the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Alterations in mental status range from mild somnolence to coma.</p><p>Akathisia is an acute psychomotor restlessness, characterized by a feeling of unease and inability to sit still. Most patients can suppress these behaviors briefly using voluntary control. Acute dystonic reactions are sustained muscular spasms, most commonly affecting the neck (30 percent), tongue (17 percent), or jaw (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Choreoathetoid movements, opisthotonus, oculogyric crisis, and respiratory dystonia are less common manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have overdosed on antipsychotic medication may be clinically indistinguishable from those who have overdosed on a wide variety of medications with sedative properties, including benzodiazepines, prescription insomnia medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zaleplon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zaleplon</a>), cyclic antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>), centrally acting alpha 2 receptor agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>), anticonvulsants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>), and atypical antipsychotics.

Fortunately, in the absence of cardiovascular effects, the same supportive care measures provide effective treatment for both typical antipsychotic medication overdoses and these mimics.</p><p>Many nontoxicologic syndromes can produce CNS depression, including hypoglycemia, acute hepatic failure, CNS infections, massive cerebrovascular accidents, severe electrolyte disorders, blunt head trauma, and septic or other forms of shock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 4</a>).

Serum concentrations of specific antipsychotic drugs may be obtained if the diagnosis is in doubt. However, the results have little clinical value because they cannot be obtained readily and levels correlate poorly with clinical manifestations. Antipsychotic medications have been associated with hyponatremia and thus a serum sodium concentration should be measured in patients with an altered mental status or seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Routine laboratory evaluation of the poisoned patient includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingerstick glucose, to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of any alteration in mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG), to rule out conduction system poisoning by drugs that effect the QRS or QTc intervals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway, breathing, and circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pure antipsychotic medication overdoses rarely cause significant respiratory depression, many patients overdose on multiple substances and require airway protection. Oxygen saturation monitoring should be performed and supplemental oxygen administered as necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypotension should initially be treated with IV boluses of isotonic fluid, such as normal saline. Hypotension refractory to normal saline should be treated with a direct-acting alpha-adrenergic agonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>.</p><p>QRS prolongation may contribute to impaired circulation.

These cases are easily managed with supportive care and hospitalization until signs of overdose have resolved.</p><p>Rarely, patients experience a severely symptomatic overdose. Patients with a profoundly depressed mental status or coma require aggressive intervention, including endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Seizures that occur in the setting of antipsychotic overdose or toxicity are treated with benzodiazepines. Such seizures are generally self-limited and traditional antiepileptics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> are NOT indicated.</p><p>Hyperthermia, when mild, may be treated by undressing the patient or with evaporative cooling measures. Severe hyperthermia, particularly if it develops in the setting of muscular rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability, raises the specter of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and should be managed aggressively.

Naloxone does not reverse the CNS depression caused by antipsychotic medication overdosage. The use and dosing of naloxone are discussed separately.

If hypoxia and aspiration pneumonitis can be prevented, patients generally do well. No study has shown that gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) improves the outcome or hastens the recovery from antipsychotic overdose. Therefore, GI decontamination is not mandatory. A single dose of AC (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> up to 50 g) may be administered to patients with intact airway reflexes or whose airway is protected following endotracheal intubation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Should polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) occur, it can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> (1 to 2 g IV), overdrive pacing, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> infusion, or synchronized or unsynchronized cardioversion. Stopping any offending medication, including antipsychotic medications that prolong the QT interval, is paramount. Because up to 10 percent of patients who develop medication-related TdP harbor mutations associated with the long QT syndrome, these patients should be referred to a cardiologist. The management of polymorphic VT is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-tachyarrhythmias#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to avoid giving medications that would further prolong repolarization to the patient with a prolonged QT interval. A list of such drugs can be found in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 5</a>). In addition to antipsychotics and antidepressants, common medications on this list include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-typical-antipsychotic-medication-poisoning/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Studies involving patients with the genetically determined congenital long-QT syndrome suggest that prolongation of the absolute (uncorrected) QT interval beyond 500 msec confers an increased risk of TdP. Unfortunately, data correlating the QT interval (absolute or corrected) with the risk of drug induced TdP are lacking, and some evidence is contradictory. A reasonable, conservative approach is to continue monitoring a patient with medication-induced QT prolongation until the QTc is below 500 msec and decreasing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinergic delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All typical antipsychotic medications have anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) properties; overdoses of typical antipsychotic medications occasionally present with anticholinergic delirium. The management of anticholinergic delirium and related symptoms is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticholinergic-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but potentially lethal side effect of antipsychotic medications characterized by mental status change, rigidity, fever, and dysautonomia (eg, labile blood pressure). The management of NMS is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p>A related condition, neuroleptic induced catatonia, has been described. Neuroleptic induced catatonia resembles NMS, but without fever, and usually responds to benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;, section on 'Malignant catatonia'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracorporeal removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of their lipophilicity, high protein binding, and large volume of distribution, hemodialysis is not useful in the management of antipsychotic medication overdose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing treatment and disposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial stabilization, care of the patient with typical antipsychotic medication overdose is primarily supportive. Because the elimination half-life of these agents ranges from 6 to 24 hours and the antimuscarinic effects of the drugs can cause prolonged GI absorption, recovery generally takes one to three days. Although occasionally patients wake up quickly enough to be discharged from the emergency department (ED), hospital admission is the rule. Peak clinical effects are usually manifest upon or shortly after arrival to the hospital. Depending upon the nursing and monitoring resources available on inpatient units, patients who remain stable after a period of observation in the ED may not require ICU admission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manifestations and management of typical antipsychotic medication overdose are the same in children and adults.</p><p>A child who accidentally ingests a dose of a typical antipsychotic medication that is less than the equivalent of the maximum therapeutic dose for a 24 hour period for that child's weight, has no sign of intoxication after a four to six hour period of observation, and has reliable caregivers may be observed at home rather than admitted to the hospital.</p><p>Consultation with a poison control center is strongly recommended in all cases of pediatric overdose.

Many patients present obtunded and history is obtained from family, friends, first responders, and pharmacists. Acute extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS), such as akathisia and dystonic reactions, can occur with any dose. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Acute extrapyramidal syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical antipsychotic poisoning does not cause any pathognomonic signs. The range of possible examination findings is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have overdosed on antipsychotic medication may be clinically indistinguishable from those who have overdosed on a wide variety of medications with sedative properties (eg, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, cyclic antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics), as well as patients with somnolence or delirium from medical causes (eg, hypoglycemia, CNS infection, head trauma). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with a pure antipsychotic medication overdose present with CNS depression and no more than minor vital sign perturbations. These cases are managed with supportive care. Some patients overdose on multiple substances and require airway protection. Hypotension is treated with IV boluses of isotonic fluid. QRS prolongation from acute antipsychotic intoxication is treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Airway, breathing, and circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe complications from typical antipsychotic poisoning rarely occur. Seizures are treated with benzodiazepines. Severe hyperthermia, particularly if it develops in the setting of muscular rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability, raises the specter of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and should be managed aggressively. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'General treatment and antidotal therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many typical antipsychotic medications prolong the QT interval, torsades de pointes is uncommon. Management of QT prolongation consists of cardiac monitoring and correction of electrolyte disorders, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
