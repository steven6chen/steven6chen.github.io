Some patients require additional testing such as transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), cardiovascular computerized tomography (CT), or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to confirm the diagnosis and identify or exclude associated defects prior to surgical or percutaneous closure. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, cardiac catheterization may be needed to determine the best management strategy.</p><p>Conditions that are likely to require surgical correction should be identified prior to intervention:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primum ASD, sinus venosus defects, and coronary sinus defects require surgical closure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primum ASD is usually accompanied by a cleft mitral valve. A cleft mitral leaflet should be repaired at the time of ASD closure, even if not severely regurgitant, to avoid the need for another operation should mitral regurgitation develop or progress. Primum ASDs may also be associated with tricuspid valve abnormalities, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defects, and a more extensive defect involving the atrioventricular septum (atrioventricular septal defect). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults#H26371603\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular septal defect in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sinus venosus defects (SVD) are usually associated with one or more anomalous right-sided pulmonary veins. SVDs and the associated anomalous veins are often missed on transthoracic echocardiogram and are best visualized by TEE, CT, or CMR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coronary sinus defects (also known as &quot;unroofed coronary sinus&quot;) are often missed despite echocardiography. They are often associated with left-sided superior vena cava and may accompany other congenital anomalies including ostium primum or secundum atrial septal defects. Observation of agitated saline in the left atrium initially, rather than the right atrium, after injection into an arm vein suggests the presence of a coronary sinus defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of persistent left superior vena cava'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple ASDs may be present (eg, concurrent secundum and primum ASDs). Some patients with multiple small secundum ASDs are amenable to percutaneous closure; others require surgical closure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with ASDs have concomitant valve disease (in addition to cleft mitral valve with primum ASD as discussed above). Moderate or more tricuspid regurgitation may persist after ASD closure in the adult. We favor surgical ASD closure when there is moderate or more tricuspid regurgitation to facilitate both ASD closure and tricuspid repair at the time of operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470875260\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF CLOSURE PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181508056\"><span class=\"h2\">Considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transcatheter device closure is an alternative to surgical repair for the majority of patients with secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs).

Anatomic requirements for percutaneous closure are discussed below. A secundum ASD with a large atrial septal aneurysm or a multifenestrated atrial septum requires careful evaluation to determine whether percutaneous device closure is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Severe heart failure was seen in one patient and two had severe neurologic sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most frequent major early complication in the percutaneous group was device embolization or malposition needing surgery or further transcatheter therapy, which occurred in 30 patients. Perforation of the heart due to erosion by the device was reported in three subjects. Significant pericardial effusion requiring surgical drainage occurred in two patients. Four patients underwent vascular surgery due to a femoral venous or arterial injury.

Overall mortality rate was similar in the surgical and device closure groups (0.13 versus 0.09 percent). Rescue operation for device adverse events (0.83 percent) was 2.1 times more likely than reoperation for surgical closure (0.39 percent). However, this study was subject to a number of limitations, including reliance upon databases, which include only a fraction of adverse events, use of an estimate of total number of device closures, and inclusion of patent foramen ovale closures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181507981\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure in the presence of atrial septal aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) is defined as redundant and mobile interatrial septal tissue in the region of the fossa ovalis with phasic excursion of at least 10 to 15 mm during the cardiorespiratory cycle.

Perforated aneurysms can be closed surgically or percutaneously, depending upon their morphology. In a retrospective review of 50 patients, perforated aneurysms were classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A - aneurysm with persistent foramen ovale</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B - aneurysm with single ASD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type C - aneurysm with two perforations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type D - aneurysm with multiple perforations</p><p/><p>Thirty-two had systemic thromboembolism or transient ischemic attacks, eight presented with dyspnea on exertion, and 10 were asymptomatic but had significant left-to-right shunt and right ventricular volume overload.

(See <a href=\"#H336927359\" class=\"local\">'Minimally invasive surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Pericardial or Dacron patch closure is generally the surgical treatment of choice for secundum, primum, and sinus venosus ASD repair.

Some surgeons advocate cannulation of the superior vena cava rather than the right atrium to reduce the incidence of postoperative arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In patients with sinus venosus defect with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage entering the mid or upper superior vena cava, the Warden procedure (cephalic superior vena cava anastomosed to the right atrial appendage, and the caudal superior vena cava redirected to the left atrium, to serve as a conduit for pulmonary venous drainage) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].

The evidence for this recommendation comes from data in patients undergoing other types of cardiac surgery. The benefit is seen when therapy is begun prior to or immediately after surgery and is independent of the agent or dose used. The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain, but beta blockers are often continued until the first postoperative visit.

Long-term periodic follow-up is indicated because of the late occurrence of AF, atrial flutter, and stroke, particularly in adults over age 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

In a report of 211 adults, for example, the incidence of AF or atrial flutter prior to surgery was 1 percent for those aged 18 to 40, 30 percent for those aged 40 to 60, and 80 percent in those over the age of 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Observational data suggest that ASD closure may reduce but does not eliminate the risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias. The effect of surgical or percutaneous defect closure on the prevalence of atrial arrhythmias was evaluated by a systematic review, including 26 studies in which a total of 1841 patients (with median or mean age at least 18 years prior to intervention) underwent surgical closure and 945 patients underwent percutaneous closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in the prevalence of atrial tachyarrhythmias after atrial septal defect closure (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.77). This effect was found after both surgical closure (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.87) and percutaneous closure (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.76). A significant decline in atrial tachyarrhythmias was seen both at &lt;30 days and midterm (30 days to five years) follow-up. Limitations of the analysis include differences in methods for monitoring arrhythmias before and after closure in most of the studies.</p><p>The risk of AF after ASD closure is presumably primarily related to irreversible factors, such as incomplete atrial remodeling, that predispose to the arrhythmia. Surgical techniques, such the Maze procedure performed at the time of surgical ASD closure, decrease the long-term incidence of AF in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/70,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,72,73</a>]. This procedure involves the placement of incisions or cryolesions in the atria to interrupt the macroreentrant circuits that sustain atrial flutter and AF (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>). The use of radiofrequency ablation to create endocardial lesions is also effective in preventing recurrences of AF, although data are limited in the patients with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
