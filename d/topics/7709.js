DCM is characterized by dilatation and systolic dysfunction of one or both ventricles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DCM is classified as idiopathic (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, or IDC) when all usual clinically detectable, except genetic, causes have been excluded. Such detectable causes of DCM include ischemic DCM and a variety of toxic, metabolic, or infectious agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>). Although specialists commonly apply the diagnosis of IDC to DCMs of unknown cause, an etiology is present but undetected.</p><p>Family-based studies of first-degree relatives during the 1990s established that familial dilated cardiomyopathy (familial DCM) can be identified in 20 to 35 percent of patients diagnosed with IDC by clinical screening (electrocardiography, echocardiography) of family members. Most familial DCM is transmitted in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, although all inheritance patterns have been identified (autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial). During the past 20 years, familial DCM genetic studies have identified mutations in more than 30 genes.</p><p>Most patients with a genetic basis causing their DCM will have an initial diagnosis of IDC. Given the frequency of familial DCM, evaluation of new IDC cases should include a careful three to four generation family history and clinical screening of first-degree family members as described below.</p><p>Developments have dramatically and favorably affected efforts to identify and understand the genetic basis of DCM, including the enormous impact of next generation sequencing (NGS) and the availability of very large databases of exome or genome sequences that can be used as reference sequences in gene discovery programs (eg, the Exome Study Project, Exome Variant Server, the Thousand Genomes Project, the <a href=\"http://exac.broadinstitute.org/&amp;token=+Fj6u4oJuJi/yQo1Gn1RR7o8loLfsJ0J+PY6+pnmGzX1YL3rZczMaJCmlYqapiKo&amp;TOPIC_ID=4911\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Exome Aggregation Consortium [ExAC]</a>, and the <a href=\"http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/&amp;token=oFpQeGj3epa/9IOHDk2SSpSx9XmNnb2jqCc7plMroC9lc758ZMJS9QnA3wKNpDV5&amp;TOPIC_ID=4911\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genome Aggregation Database [gnomAD]</a>).

No unique clinical characteristics have been identified for these truncating mutations but adverse events may occur earlier in men than in women. The role of missense mutations, common among all patient groups, was not addressed in the study. Furthermore, approximately 3 percent of control DNAs also carried TTN truncating variants, raising the question of pathogenicity of even truncating variants.

To date, mutations in LMNA are the most commonly identified cause of genetic DCM in cohorts of patients with familial DCM with prevalence ranging from 5 to 8 percent. The onset of LMNA cardiomyopathy usually occurs with heart block (first degree, progressive to second and third degree), supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation), brady-tachy syndrome (sick sinus syndrome), with progressive ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. DCM onset can occur at any point in the development of conduction system disease and arrhythmia development, but usually occurs a bit after conduction system disease (and at times years later). Sudden cardiac death is also prominent with LMNA cardiomyopathy, and can occur as the presenting symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>].</p><p>Patients with LMNA-associated DCM commonly require a pacemaker. When a familial clustering of pacemakers is detected, especially when associated with DCM, the possibility of LMNA DCM should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis. In those diagnosed with LMNA DCM, identification of an indication for a pacemaker should always trigger consideration of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), even if the left ventricular ejection fraction does not meet usual criteria for ICD implantation.
