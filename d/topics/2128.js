But try to stay calm. Blood in the urine is not usually serious. Still, it is important for your child to see a doctor or nurse. The medical term for blood in the urine is &quot;hematuria.&quot;</p><p>Blood in the urine can come from the kidneys (where urine is made) or anywhere in the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes all the organs that deal with urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65630 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7833509\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes blood in the urine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood in the urine can be caused by lots of problems. In children, these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract or bladder infection, which can cause burning or pain when urinating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney infection, which can cause back pain and fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones, which usually cause belly or back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation of the urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain kidney diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury (for example, if your child falls off a bike and bruises a kidney)</p><p/><p>Sometimes, urine can look as though it is bloody even though it isn't. This can happen if your child eats a lot of beets or food dyes, or takes certain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7833524\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See a doctor or nurse if you see blood in your child's urine, or if your child's urine is pink, red, brownish-red, or the color of tea.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors find blood in the urine when they do a routine urine test. That can happen even if the urine looks normal. It means there are microscopic (trace) amounts of blood in the urine.</p><p>Sometimes, your child might need to see a doctor who specializes in treating kidney problems in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7833539\"><span class=\"h1\">Which tests should my child have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests to do based on your child's symptoms and individual situation. There are lots of tests, but your child might not need all of them.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of blood in the urine in children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urine tests</strong> &ndash; Urine tests can show what kind of cells are in the urine. This can hold clues about what might be going wrong. The doctor might also measure the amount of protein in your child's urine, since too much protein can be a sign of a kidney problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If your child has trace amounts of blood in the urine and it doesn't go away over time, he or she might have something called &quot;familial hematuria.&quot; This condition often affects family members, so your child's doctor might suggest that other people in your family get urine tests, too. Familial hematuria does not usually cause any other symptoms or health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood tests</strong> &ndash; Blood tests can show whether the kidneys are working normally, or if the child has other health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT scan</strong> &ndash; A CT scan is a special kind of X-ray. It creates a picture of the kidneys and urinary tract. Doctors can use it to check for kidney stones and other problems in the urinary tract.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney ultrasound </strong>&ndash; A kidney ultrasound is another way to create a picture of the kidneys. Doctors sometimes use ultrasound instead of a CT scan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If your child has blood the urine after an injury, his or her doctor will probably do a CT scan or ultrasound to check the urinary tract for problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood pressure </strong>&ndash; Your child's blood pressure will probably be measured. That's because high blood pressure can be a sign of certain kidney problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7833554\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what seems to have caused the blood in your child's urine. If your child had blood in his or her urine because of a bruise to the kidney, he or she might not need any treatment. On the other hand, if your child has blood in his or her urine because of a bladder or kidney infection, he or she will probably need antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7833569\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
