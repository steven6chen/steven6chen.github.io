The goals of TB screening programs are case finding and treatment of TB disease, identification and treatment of latent infection to prevent development of disease, and decreased transmission.</p><p>Most children identified with LTBI have been infected relatively recently compared with adults who may have been infected decades previously (especially those younger than age five years). Children and adolescents are at higher risk for progression from infection to TB disease (with potential for disseminated disease) than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children under two to four years of age are the highest risk of progression with development of disseminated and central nervous system tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most cases of progression to TB disease in children occur within 2 to 12 months of initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues related to diagnosis and treatment of LTBI in children will be reviewed here. Issues related to treatment of TB disease in children are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Whom to test</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14818294\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries with low incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and with sufficient resources (such as the United States), testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in children should be targeted to specific groups at risk for LTBI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression to TB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Only children who would benefit from treatment should be tested, so a decision to test presupposes a decision to treat if the test is positive.</p><p>In general, testing for LTBI is warranted to identify individuals who are at risk of new infection and to identify individuals at increased risk of reactivation due to associated conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A questionnaire developed by the Pediatric Tuberculosis Collaborative Group can be used to screen children in a variety of clinical settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72294\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef72294 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among children, the major risk factor for TB infection is contact with adults who have TB disease, either due to household exposure or residence in a region where TB is endemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113168 \">table 1</a>). Transmission from other children with TB disease is possible if the index child has smear-positive disease but is highly unlikely if the index child has smear-negative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Identification of a child with a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) should prompt testing of the other children in the household as well as investigation for the index source case.</p><p>There is no lower age limit for screening. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that risk assessment (ie, questionnaire) for TB should be performed at first contact with a child and every six months thereafter for the first year of life (eg, at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months of age) and annually thereafter, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. LTBI testing should be performed if TB disease is suspected at any time. However, a negative TST or IGRA result may not be reliable in infants younger than three months of age.</p><p>In the absence of risk factors, LTBI testing is not indicated. There is no role for routine TST placement for children entering school, daycare, or camps. Very low rates of LTBI and TB disease have been observed in evaluation of universal school-based screening in the United States (less than 2 percent and less than 0.02 percent, respectively), so universal testing would lead to a high rate of false-positive tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Case contacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case contacts of a patient with TB disease must be evaluated for TB disease with a history, physical exam, chest radiograph, and TST or IGRA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ruling out tuberculosis disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment for LTBI should be pursued if there is no evidence for TB disease. Testing for LTBI early in the setting of recent exposure may result in a false-negative TST or IGRA. Because recent child contacts &lt;5 years are at increased risk for progression to disease (40 percent risk in infants &lt;12 months and 25 percent in children 1 to 2 years), these patients should initiate LTBI treatment even if their first TST or IGRA result is negative (known as &quot;window prophylaxis&quot;), as the child's cellular immune response to TB may not have fully developed at the time of initial testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Those with a negative TST or IGRA performed as part of the initial work-up should have a repeat test 8 to 12 weeks after the last date of contact with the index patient. If the repeat test is positive, the course of LTBI treatment should be completed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65944 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>). If the repeat test is negative, treatment may be discontinued.</p><p>In resource-limited settings where LTBI testing and radiography are not available, evaluation for TB disease in child contacts should be performed based on clinical assessment. In the absence of evidence of TB disease, child contacts should receive treatment in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment regimens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Children born in TB-endemic regions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children born in TB-endemic regions (including immigrants and adopted children) should be tested for LTBI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some experts favor a threshold TB incidence &ge;40 per 100,000 to determine which children should be tested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The optimal timing for LTBI testing is uncertain, since a false-negative TST or IGRA may be observed in the setting of recent TB exposure. To avoid this problem, it is appropriate to perform LTBI screening 8 to 12 weeks after immigration. However, performing a TST or IGRA immediately after immigration may be appropriate for children with significant risk of progression to TB disease (including children who are malnourished or immunosuppressed). In such cases, repeat testing should be performed three to six months later if the initial test is negative. The second TST is defined as positive if the induration measures &ge;10 mm and has increased by &ge;6 mm since the previous test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine administration can confound TST interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. It is not possible to distinguish between a positive TST due to LTBI from a positive TST due to previous BCG vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. IGRAs are useful for making this distinction; these assays are positive in those with LTBI but negative in those with BCG vaccination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, data to guide IGRA interpretation in children &lt;5 years of age are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the relative risk of LTBI among patients with cancer to inform screening recommendations; it included two studies of South African children and noted that children with solid cancers or hematologic malignancies had a high relative risk of TB (incidence relative risk of 16.8, 95% CI 8.8-32.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Children who will be receiving significant immunosuppressive therapy (particularly immunobiologic modulating agents) should be tested for LTBI before starting therapy since immunosuppression can lead to reactivation of latent infection and result in TB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>HIV-infected children should be screened annually for TB beginning at 3 to 12 months of age or when HIV infection is diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">How to test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic tools for LTBI include TST and IGRA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86574\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86574 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculin skin test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to dosing, administration, and false-positive and false-negative results in children are the same as for adults; these are discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58908 \">table 4</a>).

These assays have sensitivity similar to the TST but greater specificity for the diagnosis of LTBI and are most useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The published data on the use of IGRA in children is less extensive than in adults, but a number of studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that IGRAs perform well in most children &ge;4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. The sensitivity of IGRA in high-burden TB settings is lower than the sensitivity in low-burden settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends IGRAs in place of a TST to confirm TB infection in immunocompetent children &ge;5 years who received BCG vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. There is insufficient evidence to support routine use of IGRAs in children &lt;5 years for evaluation of TB infection in the absence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some experts favor use of IGRAs to evaluate children ages 2 to 4, especially in the setting of BCG vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>]. Most experts do not favor IGRA use in children &lt;2 years due to insufficient data; TST is preferred in this age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86574\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86574 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>IGRAs should be interpreted with caution in immunocompromised children. IGRAs include positive control assays for lymphocyte responsiveness; if insufficient control reactivity is documented in these children, IGRA test results are considered indeterminate or invalid.</p><p>For evaluation of LTBI among children &ge;5 years, the decision between use of IGRA or TST should be guided by whether sensitivity or specificity is of greater importance. For circumstances in which high specificity is desired (for example, among healthy children who received BCG vaccination), IGRA is superior; it may be used alone or to confirm or refute a prior TST result. For circumstances in which high sensitivity is desired (for example, among children with suspected TB disease or children who require immunosuppressive therapy), either a TST or IGRA (or both) may be performed; any positive result should be considered significant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98813 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>A positive IGRA result in a child should be considered indicative of infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (as LTBI or TB disease). A negative IGRA result cannot conclusively exclude a diagnosis of LTBI (or TB disease) and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical data. Indeterminate IGRA results can occur frequently in children &lt;5 years; an indeterminate result in a child of any age should not be used for clinical decision-making.</p><p>Interpretation of discordant results between TST and IGRA is challenging in part because neither can be considered a gold standard for diagnosing LTBI. As with the TST, recent conversion from a negative to a positive IGRA result has been shown to be associated with an increased risk for developing TB disease; the risk was eightfold higher in a study of adolescents in South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RULING OUT TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) disease must be pursued in children with a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a>.

In the setting of difficulty with adherence, two or three times weekly therapy under direct observation for nine months also provides substantial protection. Protection from six months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoniazid</a> may be adequate (60 to 70 percent efficacy) if adherence is good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Guidelines in most resource-limited countries advise six months of treatment, which is in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/11,12,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,37</a>]. In some jurisdictions, directly observed therapy for LTBI can be instituted twice weekly. This is especially useful for household contacts of cases or other children who are at particularly high risk of progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease.</p><p>INH is generally well tolerated. Adverse reactions, which include drug-induced hepatitis, gastrointestinal disturbances, peripheral neuropathy, and skin rashes, are rare. Hepatotoxicity is the most serious adverse reaction. Presentation of hepatotoxicity due to INH is variable; asymptomatic transaminase elevation is most common, reported in 5 to 10 percent of children receiving INH for LTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], with slight elevations that remain stable during the course of treatment. Other manifestations include clinical hepatitis that resolves upon discontinuation of INH and fulminant hepatitis with liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, since the risk for developing INH-induced hepatitis is increased in the setting of malnutrition, preexisting liver disease, and use of other hepatotoxic drugs, baseline liver function assessment should be performed prior to initiation of INH when these conditions are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Pyridoxine supplementation (25 to 50 mg daily) should be administered together with INH for infants who are being exclusively breastfed, children and adolescents on meat- and milk-deficient diets, pregnant adolescents, and those with conditions that can predispose to neuropathy (including diabetes, uremia, malnutrition, and HIV infection).

Some experts recommend using a fluoroquinolone antibiotic for treatment of MDR LTBI that is presumed fluoroquinolone susceptible; some experts would give a second or third drug to which the organism is likely susceptible, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pyrazinamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ethambutol</a>. There is no agreement on the optimal duration for any of these regimens in children; typically, those used in adults are tolerated in children.

If symptoms develop subsequently that raise the possibility of TB disease, evaluation should be pursued with chest radiograph and other investigations as outlined in detail separately.

Only children who would benefit from treatment should be tested, so a decision to test presupposes a decision to treat if the test is positive. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children, the major risk factor for TB infection (or disease) is contact with patients who have TB disease, either due to household exposure or residence in a region where TB is endemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72294\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef72294 \">form 1</a>). Young children and adolescents are at a higher risk than adults for progression from infection to TB disease (with potential for disseminated disease). Therefore, prompt identification and treatment of LTBI is important in these age groups. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For evaluation of LTBI among children &ge;5 years of age, the decision between use of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) should be guided by whether sensitivity or specificity is of greater importance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86574\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86574 \">algorithm 1</a>). For circumstances in which high specificity is desired (for example, among healthy children who received Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin [BCG] vaccination), IGRA is superior; it may be used alone or to confirm or refute a prior TST result. For circumstances in which high sensitivity is desired (for example, among children with suspected TB disease or children who require immunosuppressive therapy), both a TST and IGRA may be performed; any positive result should be considered significant. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Interferon-gamma release assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For evaluation of LTBI among children 2 to 4 years of age, some experts favor use of IGRA, especially in the setting of prior BCG vaccination. For evaluation of LTBI in children &lt;2 years old, TST should be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86574\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86574 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'How to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because recent child contacts &lt;5 years of age are at increased risk for progression to TB disease, these patients should begin LTBI treatment even if the first TST or IGRA result is negative. Those with negative TST or IGRA performed as part of the initial work-up should have repeat testing 8 to 12 weeks after the last date of contact with the index patient. If the repeat test is positive, the prophylaxis course should be continued to completion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65944 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78596 \">table 2</a>). If the repeat test is negative, prophylaxis may be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Case contacts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing for LTBI screening among children born in TB-endemic regions is uncertain, since a false-negative TST or IGRA may be observed in the setting of recent TB exposure. Immediate testing is advised in high-risk children; in others, testing should be performed 8 to 12 weeks after immigration. In addition, it is not possible to distinguish between a positive TST due to LTBI and a positive TST due to previous BCG vaccination. IGRAs are useful for making this distinction; these assays are positive in those with LTBI but negative in those with BCG vaccination alone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Children born in TB-endemic regions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for TB disease must be pursued in children with positive TST or IGRA. Treatment for LTBI should be initiated only after TB disease has been ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ruling out tuberculosis disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoniazid</a> for treatment of LTBI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65944 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest daily therapy for nine months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with difficulties related to adherence, directly observed therapy also confers substantial protection.
