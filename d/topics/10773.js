Chronic daily headache types of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache. Medication overuse headache (MOH), a secondary headache disorder, frequently complicates management of multiple primary headache disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-daily-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic daily headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of MOH. The treatment and prognosis of MOH is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication overuse headache (MOH) is the term applied to headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication for more than three months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. MOH has also been termed analgesic rebound headache, drug-induced headache, and medication-misuse headache.</p><p>Although not a primary type of chronic daily headache, MOH deserves proper coverage since it frequently coexists with primary chronic daily headache. In some cases, MOH may be associated with the development or maintenance of a chronic daily headache syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available evidence suggests many drugs used for the acute symptomatic treatment of headache can cause medication overuse headache (MOH) in individuals with primary headache disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The precise mechanisms that lead to MOH are still uncertain. However, multiple factors seem to play a role, including genetic predisposition, central sensitization, and biobehavioral factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various studies and clinical observations suggest that MOH is restricted to individuals who already have other headache disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, MOH does not develop de novo in individuals with no previous headache history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In a study of 103 patients using daily analgesics for arthritic pain but not for headache, only 8 patients (8 percent) had chronic daily headache, each of whom reported a previous history of episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This study supports the hypothesis that patients with previous episodic headaches may be susceptible to developing MOH and that analgesics may merely be a cofactor to the development of chronic daily headache in a genetically vulnerable individual.</p><p>Patients with migraine and tension-type headache seem to have the highest potential for MOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, MOH has also been described in cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and in hemicrania continua [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Central sensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigations demonstrating facilitation of trigeminal pain processing in patients with chronic headache have suggested that central sensitization, the same process that occurs in migraine, can lead to MOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,10</a>]. Daily exposure to some triptans can downregulate serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 1D, and influence serotonin synthesis in the rat central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p>In humans, chronic exposure to triptans and other analgesics could lead to downregulation of serotonin receptors and changes in central inhibitory pathways that translate to an impairment of antinociceptive activity and a permanent feeling of head pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In support of this argument, neurophysiologic studies have shown facilitation of trigeminal and somatic nociceptive systems in MOH primarily mediated at a supraspinal level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another study in rats found that sustained or repeated triptan treatment induced pro-nociceptive neural adaptations and enhanced responses to nitric oxide, a known trigger of migraine headache in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, a report that measured glucose metabolism in migraineurs with MOH using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) demonstrated reversible metabolic change in pain processing structures and persistent orbitofrontal hypofunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Exposure to opiates also causes changes in the nervous system. Peripherally, the chronic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> results in increased expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide in primary afferent neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Centrally, prolonged exposure to this opiate leads to increased descending facilitation from the rostral ventromedial medulla and increased excitatory neurotransmission at the level of the dorsal horn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The combination of these may result in MOH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biobehavioral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that MOH is a biobehavioral disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some patients may have addictive disease, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and drug taking behavior despite negative consequences, as the basis of MOH. Other patients may use opiates or other drugs with <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/anxiolytic</span> effects to treat both pain and a coexistent anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Behaviors that may be particularly important in prompting and sustaining the overuse of medication include fear of headache, anticipatory anxiety, obsessional drug-taking behavior, and psychologic drug dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a prospective population-based longitudinal study of 32,067 adults from Norway, subjects using analgesics daily or weekly at baseline had a significantly increased risk of chronic pain 11 years later compared with those who never used analgesics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

There are conflicting data regarding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well, with the estimated risk of MOH from NSAIDs being low in most studies but high in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The course of the headache disorder and the history of drug intake and intake frequency are the only available methods of diagnosis. A history of analgesic use averaging more than two to three days per week in association with chronic daily headache supports the diagnosis of MOH. The diagnosis is made when there is a pattern of frequent headaches that fulfill diagnostic criteria for MOH listed below.

Typically, the patient with MOH has an underlying primary headache disorder (eg, migraine, tension-type headache) that gradually or abruptly increased in frequency, which in turn led to an increased intake of analgesics and eventually to MOH superimposed upon the primary headache disorder. At this stage, patients may find themselves taking daily or frequent analgesics merely to prevent a disabling analgesic withdrawal headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise mechanisms that lead to MOH are still uncertain. However, multiple factors seem to play a role. These include (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic predisposition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central sensitization of trigeminal pain processing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Biobehavioral factors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of MOH in the general population is approximately 1 to 2 percent, and is higher in women than in men. Migraine is the most common primary headache disorder associated with MOH. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many acute symptomatic medications used to treat headaches have the potential for causing MOH. Estimates of the risk for MOH have varied across studies, but can be summarized as follows (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Causal medications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Highest with opioids, butalbital-containing combination analgesics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a></span> combinations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intermediate to low with triptans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Likely low with NSAIDs, although some studies suggest the risk could be high</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of MOH is typically preceded by an episodic headache disorder, usually migraine or tension-type headache, that has been treated with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. MOH often manifests as a headache that is present or develops upon awakening, and commonly occurs daily or nearly daily. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MOH is based upon clinical impression. A history of analgesic use averaging more than two to three days per week in association with chronic daily headache is suggestive. The diagnosis is made when the pattern of frequent headaches fulfills the diagnostic criteria for MOH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71798 \">table 1</a>).
