In most cases, mastectomy also includes removal of the nipple-areolar complex, some overlying skin, and the pectoral fascia. Types of mastectomy include radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, simple mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy. The differences between the types of mastectomy are explained below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374254783\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A radical mastectomy (Halsted mastectomy) consists of en bloc removal of the breast, the overlying skin, the pectoralis major and minor muscles, and the entire axillary contents (level I, II, and III nodes). This extensive resection was originally proposed to provide a better chance of disease control than lumpectomy alone and was the standard of care for treating breast cancer for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, despite improved local control, the curative potential of this operation remained limited. In a series that followed 1438 women who had undergone radical mastectomy over 30 years, only 13 percent were free of disease and 57 percent had died of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Radical mastectomy is rarely used today.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374254789\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified radical mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is complete removal of the breast and the underlying fascia of the pectoralis major muscle along with the removal of the level I and II axillary lymph nodes. Several randomized trials documented equivalent survival rates with MRM as compared with radical mastectomy, with less morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The equivalent survival outcome of the two procedures was further confirmed in an analysis of 3236 women enrolled in four randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

The difference between MRM and a simple mastectomy is that the former includes axillary dissection (level I and level II axillary dissection being the standard procedure). With the emergence of sentinel node biopsy, simple mastectomy is performed more frequently than in the past.

The breast parenchyma is excised, usually through a circular incision around the nipple areolar complex, with a lateral extension if needed to access the axilla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71134 \">figure 4</a>). In some cases, the existing biopsy scar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the skin overlying the tumor is also excised. A reconstructive procedure is typically performed in the same setting as a SSM. Preservation of the skin of the breast and the inframammary fold provides the reconstructed breast with a more natural shape and contour. The superior cosmetic result has resulted in the increasing popularity of this approach in both the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-24</a>].

Because this technique results in large flaps, it is primarily utilized for women with small to moderate sized breasts with minimal ptosis. It is very appropriate for patients undergoing mastectomy for prophylaxis; however, it can be used in selected patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy. Most retrospective studies of NSM have limited its use to women with small peripherally located tumors, without multicentricity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Full-thickness skin flap necrosis requires surgical debridement and may require skin grafting, and result in delays in adjuvant treatment and diminished cosmetic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Prior radiation treatment, obesity, older age, and a smoking history can increase the rates of flap necrosis. Technical methods of decreasing the risk of skin flap necrosis include minimizing the use of electric cautery method in dissection, maintaining appropriate skin flap thickness, and avoiding tension on closure of the incision.</p><p>The use of tumescence solution (ie, 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) injected into the subcutaneous tissue is associated with a high risk of flap necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. The tumescent mastectomy technique was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of skin flap necrosis in a series of 100 mastectomies performed using the tumescent technique as compared with 280 mastectomies performed without tumescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374254965\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burning, aching, and tight constriction of the axilla, upper arm, and chest wall, with superimposed lancinations and scar sensitivity are characteristic of postmastectomy pain. In the past, less than 10 percent of patients undergoing mastectomy developed chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]; subsequent surveys have reported chronic pain, paresthesias, and phantom sensations in up to one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. This trend may be related to the radiation and chemotherapy which are often needed in addition to surgery. Although the available data are scant, at least one long-term follow-up study suggests that approximately one-half of cases resolve over time, while the remainder persist long-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p>Factors that contribute to the development of postmastectomy pain include axillary dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>] and breast reconstruction with implants after mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Submuscular implant placement can cause injury to the long thoracic, thoracodorsal, lateral-pectoral, and medial-pectoral nerves. Capsule formation around the implant also may entrap the long thoracic and the two pectoral nerves.</p><p>Evaluation of chest and arm pain after mastectomy should focus upon the nature of the pain and its location, and a neurologic examination to define the areas of sensory loss and hypersensitivity. Pain that is not typical of postmastectomy pain syndrome should prompt evaluation for infection, tumor recurrence, or other causes of chest pain, such as cardiac, pulmonary, or esophageal disease.
