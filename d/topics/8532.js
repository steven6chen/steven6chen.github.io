Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is caused by high LVOT blood velocities that pull the anterior mitral valve leaflet toward the ventricular septum (Venturi or drag effect). In addition, as the anterior mitral valve leaflet is displaced toward the septum, a gap may form between both mitral valve leaflets, which results in posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation. The goal of therapy of LVOT obstruction in HCM is to reverse or reduce the pathophysiologic factors responsible for obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology and evolution of LVOT obstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1581410394\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LVOT OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a strong, independent predictor of heart failure symptoms and the most important determinant of limiting symptoms in patients with HCM. Management strategies attempt to increase LV chamber size or decrease cardiac inotropy, thereby diminishing systolic anterior motion (SAM)-septal contact, resulting in a reduced or abolished LVOT gradient. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy options exist to treat symptomatic LVOT obstruction in patients with HCM.</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy is the first-line approach in patients with HCM and symptomatic LVOT obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86793 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

An invasive septal reduction therapy is required in approximately 5 percent of all patients with HCM and up to 30 percent in tertiary referral populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Dual chamber pacing can be tried in some patients, but this is now primarily performed in patients who have a dual chamber ICD implantation for other indications or in patients who are not candidates for or do not want to pursue invasive septal reduction therapies.

In addition, abnormalities of the mitral valve and papillary muscles can be addressed at the time of septal myectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10465780\"><span class=\"h3\">Myectomy procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For surgical septal myectomy, a thoracotomy is performed, and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Following this, an aortotomy is performed and the proximal septum is approached through the aortic valve. Approximately 3 to 15 g of ventricular septal muscle are excised and removed in order to widen out the LV outflow tract area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].</p><p>The contemporary procedure usually involves a distal extension of the myectomy trough to the base of the papillary muscles along with inspection and, if needed, revision of mitral valve leaflets and chordal structures. Extending the myectomy trough allows for release (or realignment) of anterolateral papillary muscle, which is often apically displaced (and frequently fused to the LV wall) and as a result tethers the plane of the mitral valve toward the basal septum. The combination of myectomy trough and anterolateral papillary muscle release usually results in widening of the LVOT area, elimination of Venturi forces, complete reduction of the LVOT gradient, and substantial decrease in the degree of mitral regurgitation. Multiple groups have shown this contemporary myectomy procedure to be effective in patients with significant LVOT obstruction with relatively lesser amounts of basal septal hypertrophy, in whom a significant number of patients required mitral valve and papillary muscle intervention as part of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>An apical approach may be performed in a very small number of patients in whom there is substantial hypertrophy in the distal portion of the LV cavity; this procedure is intended to enlarge the LV cavity for better LV filling and a resultant improvement in stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Intraoperative echocardiography is vital in preoperative guidance of septal morphology and thickness as well as the mitral valve and subvalvular anatomy. In addition, intraoperative TEE also provides an accurate assessment of outflow gradients to ensure that outflow obstruction is eliminated in the immediate post-operative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17509149\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitral valve intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral valve repair is occasionally performed at the time of septal myectomy, predominantly in patients with elongated leaflets or mitral regurgitation caused by primary mitral valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. However, mitral valve replacement as the primary method of relieving obstruction is now infrequently performed, given the improvements in symptoms and LVOT gradient following septal myectomy in nearly all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. In a series of 1134 patient who underwent septal myectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1961 and 2007, only nine patients (1 percent) underwent mitral valve replacement without myectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>For patients with HCM and refractory heart failure symptoms related to LVOT obstruction and who are not candidates for a septal reduction therapy, percutaneous mitral valve plication may be effective in reducing the LVOT gradient and relieving heart failure symptoms. In a cohort of six patients who underwent mitral valve plication using the MitraClip device (which was successfully implanted in five patients, with the procedure aborted in one patient due to the development of cardiac tamponade), there was significant immediate improvement in the LVOT gradient (from 91 to 12 mmHg), mitral regurgitation grade (from 3 to 0.8), and cardiac output (from 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/minute</span> to 4.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/minute)</span> following the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Moderate mitral stenosis was documented in two patients immediately following mitral valve plication. Over an average follow-up of 15 months, there was significant improvement in symptoms, with all patients achieving NYHA class I or II functional status. However, three patients were noted on long-term follow-up to have increased LVOT velocities without documented systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, a finding of unclear significance that needs additional investigation. Additional data and longer-term follow-up are required to better assess the efficacy, safety, and proper patient selection for mitral valve plication in patients with obstructive HCM and refractory symptomatic LVOT obstruction.</p><p>Neither primary mitral valve replacement nor mitral valve plication should be performed for relief of LVOT obstruction if septal reduction therapy is an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10466021\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications of septal myectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of myectomy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive removal of muscle can cause a ventricular septal defect (2 percent risk), a serious complication that may be more common in patients with only a mildly hypertrophied (relatively thin) septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/11,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33,34</a>].

However, occasional patients have persistent limiting symptoms, typically associated with a significant residual LVOT gradient (&lt;2 percent of patients following surgical septal myectomy, up to 10 percent of patients following alcohol septal ablation), and may be candidates for a second invasive septal reduction therapy in an effort to further relieve obstruction and improve symptoms.</p><p>Patients with residual LVOT obstruction and limiting symptoms after an initial invasive septal reduction therapy, and who are considered candidates for a second procedure, should be considered for a second invasive procedure, although this is entirely based on expert opinion. The choice of surgical septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation for the second procedure depends on the individual circumstances of why the first procedure failed and the wishes and desires of the patient. In one retrospective single-center cohort of 375 patients who underwent alcohol septal ablation, 20 patients (5 percent) subsequently underwent surgical septal myectomy for refraction symptomatic LVOT obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Following the second procedure, patients experienced a significant improvement in functional status, exercise time, and LVOT obstruction, although there was a 12 percent chance of needing a permanent pacemaker (2 of 17 patients, as 3 already had a pacemaker following alcohol septal ablation). Intuitively the risk of ventricular septal defect may be increased as well for patients who undergo both procedures, although there are no data on this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7187925\"><span class=\"h2\">Pacemaker therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22971942\"><span class=\"h3\">Dual chamber (RA and RV) pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early 1990s, dual chamber pacing was presented as an alternative to myectomy to improve symptoms by lowering left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients. By programming forced RV pacing, the ventricular septum moves toward the right ventricle during systole, resulting in widening of the LVOT and reduction in mitral valve contact with the septum in patients with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. Observational studies and small randomized trials suggested symptomatic and functional benefit from pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. However, subsequent data from single and multicenter randomized trials, particularly M-PATHY, demonstrated average LVOT gradient reductions of only 50 percent without improvement in exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/33,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,89,90</a>].

Only a small subset of predominantly older patients with localized mild septal hypertrophy may benefit from dual chamber pacemaker treatment. A 2012 systemic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that the majority of the published studies provided inadequate data or had a high risk of bias, and additional higher quality data were needed prior to conclusively stating if pacing was beneficial or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>As a result of the data derived from the numerous randomized trials, pacing is not considered a primary treatment of HCM and should only be considered in HCM patients who are not candidates for invasive septal reduction therapies (myectomy or alcohol septal ablation). We agree with the 2011 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA</span> Task Force on Practice Guidelines that &quot;patients with HCM who have had a dual-chamber device implanted for non-HCM indications&quot; may undergo a &quot;trial of dual-chamber atrial-ventricular pacing (from the right ventricular apex) for the relief of symptoms attributable to LVOT obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].&quot;</p><p>While patients with HCM who are candidates for other therapies should not undergo implantation of a permanent pacemaker strictly for the treatment of symptoms of LVOT obstruction, permanent pacing may be considered in medically refractory symptomatic patients with HCM and significant resting or provoked left ventricular outflow tract obstruction who are not candidates or who do not want current invasive septal reduction therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22971948\"><span class=\"h3\">Biventricular pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small studies have suggested the possibility of cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing in patients with HCM and LVOT obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] or left bundle branch block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Choosing one procedure over the other requires knowledge of the anatomy of the LVOT obstruction, concomitant cardiac problems (eg, coronary artery disease, mitral valve disease), and medical comorbidities along with the patient's preferences. In addition, the presence or absence of local expertise in one or both procedures may be a guiding factor in choosing which course of treatment or in referring the patient to another center for a particular treatment.</p><p>For patients with HCM who have advanced and limiting heart failure symptoms that are refractory to medical therapy, along with an LVOT gradient &ge;50 mmHg at rest or following provocation (exercise echocardiography preferably), we recommend septal reduction therapy. For patients who are candidates for either surgical septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation, we suggest surgical septal myectomy, based on greater than 50 years of experience with the procedure, clear clinical efficacy, and the ability to treat concomitant cardiac problems simultaneously. For patients in whom surgery is felt to be too high-risk due to significant comorbidities, or for patients who prefer to avoid surgery, alcohol septal ablation can be performed. This is in agreement with the 2011 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA</span> 2011 Guidelines as well as the 2014 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/5,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,95</a>]. Regardless of which invasive septal reduction therapy is chosen, the procedure should be performed in a high-volume center, as the rates of in-hospital death, need for permanent pacemaker, and complications are all significantly better at high-volume centers compared with low-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>].</p><p>Additional factors to consider in choosing between surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the potential concern that the induction of a transmural myocardial scar by the alcohol septal ablation procedure could increase future risk of ventricular arrhythmias, age is an important variable in deciding between procedures. Specifically, alcohol septal ablation should not be performed in patients &lt;21 years old and should be discouraged in those less than 40 years of age unless there are significant contraindications to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, the anatomy of the LVOT can be slightly different in each individual patient, as a number of relevant morphologic factors can contribute substantially (or can be the predominant reason) to the generation of outflow obstruction in an individual patient (including elongated mitral valve leaflet(s), anomalous insertion of the anterolateral papillary muscle directly into the mitral valve, massive LV hypertrophy, and apically displaced papillary muscles). Since these features cannot be addressed with a percutaneous approach with ASA, identifying one or more of these features can sway decision-making toward surgical myectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of concomitant cardiac problems (eg, coronary artery disease, mitral valve disease, and atrial fibrillation) may warrant a surgical approach since an adjunctive procedure will be required in addition to the surgical septal myectomy (ie, coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral valve replacement, or MAZE procedure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence or absence of local expertise in one or both procedures may be a guiding factor in choosing which course of treatment or in referring the patient to another center for a particular treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

This results in the anterior mitral valve leaflet contacting the septum (ie, SAM-septal contact) and mechanical impedance to blood flow during systole, which produces a pressure gradient between the LV and the aorta.
