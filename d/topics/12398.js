This topic reviews molecular techniques that can be used to alter the sequence or expression of a gene, including gene therapy, gene editing, and gene silencing.</p><p>Separate topics discuss related concepts and the clinical or investigational uses of these approaches in specific medical conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic diseases &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561218708\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC CONCEPTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2406252616\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following definitions apply to the methods discussed herein. A more complete glossary of related terms is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene therapy</strong> &ndash; Gene therapy refers to the introduction of an exogenous gene or genes into one or more autologous or allogeneic cell types. The new gene may be referred to as a transgene. Gene therapy may be used for a number of reasons (eg, to supply a missing gene, to bypass the role of a missing gene, or to augment therapy for a disease). Gene therapy is in limited clinical use or under investigation in several types of disorders. (See <a href=\"#H3857362561\" class=\"local\">'Gene therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene editing</strong> &ndash; Gene editing refers to the creation of sequence-specific alterations in the DNA of a cell using molecular methods that take advantage of site-directed DNA repair after strand breakage. This may be done to correct a pathogenic gene variant or to alter other biologic processes. The target cell may be a multipotent stem cell such as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), a differentiated somatic cell, or an embryonic stem cell. Gene editing is an investigational method for health care in humans. (See <a href=\"#H3766325633\" class=\"local\">'Gene editing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene silencing</strong> &ndash; Gene silencing refers to the reduction of the expression of a gene (or genes). This may be performed using a number of methods such as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that cause RNA interference (RNAi), or by inducing epigenetic alterations that silence transcription of groups of genes. There are a number of potential applications; very few are in clinical use. (See <a href=\"#H245158499\" class=\"local\">'Gene silencing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Epigenetic therapies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-epigenetics#H396153\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of epigenetics&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic uses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H948889304\"><span class=\"h2\">In vitro versus in vivo transduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cells can be transduced with a construct (gene therapy, gene editing, or gene silencing) either in vitro (ie, outside of the body) or in vivo (eg, injected into a tumor, inhaled, or administered intravenously). Following in vitro transduction, the modified cells can be administered to the patient. Following in vivo transduction, the targeting construct may home to target cells. HSCs can be transduced in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In vitro manipulations allow greater opportunity for selection and testing of the transduced cells, whereas in vivo administration allows the cells to remain in their physiologic niche, where they may be less likely to be exposed to environmental stresses such as hyperoxia or loss of normal adhesion, and, as a result, they may be less susceptible to genotoxic stress.</p><p>In either case, it may be possible to administer repeated doses of the therapy. This is easiest for treatment approaches that do not require cytotoxic therapy to eradicate the bone marrow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085088483\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of vectors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constructs for gene therapy or gene editing are delivered to the cells of interest using a vector. The choice of vector can have a major impact on efficacy and safety. A number of vector backbones have been tested since the inception of gene therapy studies. Most vectors are derived from viruses, although other types of vectors can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125745848\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics of the vector backbone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vector backbones differ in a number of characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Capacity</strong> &ndash; Different vectors can accommodate different-sized constructs. Some large genes or groups of genes require a very large-capacity vector.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Production</strong> &ndash; Vectors used clinically must be produced in sufficient quantity for administration. Depending on the clinical application and number of patients affected, production demands may influence vector selection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Target cells</strong> &ndash; Some viruses have a tissue-specific tropism. This can be manipulated in some systems. As an example, bispecific antibodies that can retarget a virus to another cell type are under investigation in preclinical models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Some viruses are only able to infect dividing cells, while others can also infect quiescent cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integrating versus non-integrating</strong> &ndash; Integrating vectors are inserted into the genomic DNA of the host cells and are replicated at every cell division, whereas non-integrating (episomal) vectors may be lost gradually with progressive cell divisions. Integrating vectors carry risks associated with their insertion into the genome, such as creating new fusion genes, damaging existing genes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leading to increased expression of an adjacent gene from a strong vector <span class=\"nowrap\">promoter/enhancer</span> region. (See <a href=\"#H2213213341\" class=\"local\">'Integrating versus non-integrating vectors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expression level</strong> &ndash; Some genes require a higher expression level, whereas others may be sufficient at lower levels. For diseases with autosomal recessive inheritance, restoration of a small amount of gene function may be sufficient for effective therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of expression</strong> &ndash; Some vectors provide long-term expression, which may be necessary for gene deficiencies. Others may have transient expression, which may be ideal for acquired disorders (eg, cancer, infection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunogenicity</strong> &ndash; The degree of immunogenicity of the virus affects the host immune response, which may in turn lead to side effects as well as loss of potency. Virus infection is common in the general population and may limit use of certain adenoviral vectors. There are a number of potential approaches to avoiding, reducing, or overriding immunogenicity, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2437552793\" class=\"local\">'Strategies to reduce immunogenicity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2213213341\"><span class=\"h3\">Integrating versus non-integrating vectors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early gene therapy vectors were based on integrating viruses such as gamma retroviruses. These were mostly supplanted by lentiviral vectors in which long-terminal repeat (LTR) enhancers were eliminated, resulting in a lower likelihood that adjacent genes will be activated, a better ability to transduce non-dividing cells, and a shorter culture period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, as discussed below, initial reports with certain integrating vector constructs described cases of oncogenesis, including fatal leukemogenesis, and a substantial body of subsequent work has focused on non-integrating vectors. (See <a href=\"#H1650941713\" class=\"local\">'Potential concerns with gene therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Non-integrating vectors include those derived from non-integrating viruses (eg, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus [AAV], poxviruses such as vaccinia), integration-deficient lentiviruses, and non-viral vectors (eg, plasmids, artificial chromosomes, nanoparticles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Adenoviral and AAV vectors can infect a variety of cell types including non-dividing cells. For instance, different AAV serotypes can be used to infect specific tissues; in particular, AAVs have good efficiency for transducing liver, muscle, and nervous tissue. These viruses potentially avoid oncogenic effects related to insertional mutagenesis or increased expression of unrelated genes that are located near the insertion site. However, there are concerns about very low-frequency integration of AAV into cellular DNA and the potential risk of genotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Most adenoviral vectors are replication deficient (due to deletion of early region 1A [E1A]) and can accommodate large inserts (up to 37 kb in high-capacity &quot;gutless&quot; vectors); they can express larger amounts of recombinant proteins than other vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, the much smaller wildtype AAV is naturally replication-defective and can replicate only in the presence of a helper virus (adenovirus); AAV vectors can only package DNA sequences up to 5 kb.</p><p>Because adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses do not normally integrate into the host genome, vector DNA will remain episomal and will be eliminated when the cell divides or dies. Furthermore, because of their tropism to liver following systemic administration, retargeting is essential for their use in other tissues.</p><p>Another disadvantage of adenoviral vectors is their immunogenicity. Potential consequences are twofold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to receive gene therapy due to prior immunity</strong> &ndash; Many individuals have developed immunity to adenoviruses from common respiratory infections (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;</a>). These infections or prior exposures from a previous dose of gene therapy can elicit serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, and cells that have been transduced with adenoviral constructs can be killed by CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can recognize different serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It may be possible to design vectors that bypass or override immunogenicity; this is an active area of research. (See <a href=\"#H2437552793\" class=\"local\">'Strategies to reduce immunogenicity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Immune/inflammatory</span> complications of treatment</strong> &ndash; In certain cases, <span class=\"nowrap\">immune/inflammatory</span> reactions to an adenoviral gene therapy construct can be severe. These reactions may preferentially affect the liver as hepatic macrophages take up viral particles and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Antiviral antibodies may also contribute. Certain adenoviral serotypes have produced acute inflammatory reactions, one of which was fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p>A smaller percentage of viral vectors under study are integrating vectors derived from retroviral backbones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These include lentiviral vectors such as those derived from HIV (with pathogenic genes removed), foamy virus (FV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV). Lentiviruses are appealing because they can infect non-dividing cells. However, clinical trials using integrating vectors have been associated with serious adverse events including leukemogenesis, highlighting the significance of the safety concerns related to the site of insertion into the host cell genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. To reduce the potential for insertional mutagenesis and related adverse effects, the genes responsible for replication competence are provided in a separate &quot;helper&quot; plasmid; this prevents the gene therapy vector from replicating independently and inserting into other sites in the genome. Other modifications include a self-inactivating (SIN) design in which <span class=\"nowrap\">promoter/enhancer</span> regions, which could cause transcription from genes near the integration site, are removed.</p><p>Another type of integrating vector takes advantage of transposons, which use a transposase enzyme to cut and paste the gene of interest into the host genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similar safety measures to those used with retroviruses are included (eg, providing the transposase enzyme in a separate plasmid).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2437552793\"><span class=\"h3\">Strategies to reduce immunogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strategies to reduce or override immunogenicity of adenoviral vectors include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of adenovirus serotypes to which most people have not been exposed (eg, group B adenovirus serotype 35, which has a special affinity for hematopoietic cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of adenovirus serotypes that infect other species (eg, chimpanzee or dog) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insertion of genes that inhibit immune or inflammatory responses (eg, genes from the adenoviral early region 3 [E3] that is responsible for downregulating host responses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deletion of viral genes that may create immunogenic epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. However, deletion of E1 and E4 did not eliminate immunogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of immune tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p/><p>Another strategy is to direct the use of adenoviral vectors to clinical settings in which transient high-level expression is optimal (eg, limited treatment of cancer or an infection).</p><p>These approaches remain an active area of research.</p><p>AAV vectors are less immunogenic than adenoviral vectors, but immunogenicity remains an important issue that interferes with sustained AAV expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Interestingly, immunogenicity was not predicted in animal models but occurred in clinical trials, likely due to the fact that most individuals have memory immune responses to AAVs due to AAV-specific neutralizing antibodies developed in childhood. In a study in which patients with hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) were treated with AAV2-factor IX via the hepatic artery, factor IX expression was short-lived, and participants developed transient hepatitis associated with the development of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to the AAV capsid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a subsequent study using intravenous administration of another AAV serotype (AAV8) with a codon-optimized factor IX transgene in six patients, only the two individuals who received the highest vector dose developed transaminitis; treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> normalized their transaminase levels and maintained factor IX levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Therefore, strategies to limit the vector dose and to use transient immunosuppression have been adopted in many subsequent clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis#H146784471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a>.)</p><p>AAV vector can be found in body fluids for several weeks after systemic administration but have not been associated with any identifiable issues in animal and human trials.</p><p>There are a number of ongoing clinical trials using AAV for multiple different applications ranging from muscular dystrophy to severe heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure#H464299276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational and emerging therapies for heart failure&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment#H995995989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Glucocorticoid and disease-modifying treatment&quot;, section on 'Other investigational therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3857362561\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691176164\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical applications of gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene therapy is a fundamentally different approach from most other therapeutics, in that it aims to treat the fundamental cause of a disease rather than the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gene therapy is in limited clinical use but is under investigation in various disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1458528863\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene therapy is an appealing way to provide a normally functioning gene to an individual who has inherited a pathogenic gene variant or variants. In many cases, the level of expression does not need to be fully restored to normal; in some cases, very low-level expression is sufficient to greatly improve a disease.</p><p>Often, a variant with special properties is used (eg, an antisickling version of beta globin in sickle cell disease, a more hemostatically active form of factor IX in hemophilia B). In addition to providing more favorable clinical effects, use of a transgene that differs in sequence from an endogenous gene facilitates monitoring of the transgene expression level.</p><p>For hematologic disorders and immunodeficiency syndromes that might otherwise be treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), gene therapy using modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) offers the ability to provide hematopoietic reconstitution with normally functioning autologous blood cells while avoiding the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In addition, restoration of normal cell counts may be more rapid than with allogeneic HCT, potentially reducing the risks associated with cytopenias post-HCT (eg, bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia, infection associated with neutropenia).</p><p>Examples of genetic disorders that may be amenable to gene therapy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal defects are good candidates for gene therapy because the eye is suitable for direct intraocular injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The eye is also immune privileged (ie, able to accept foreign antigens without mounting an <span class=\"nowrap\">immune/inflammatory</span> response), potentially reducing the likelihood of adverse inflammatory reactions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rejection of the vector. In addition, it is possible to treat the eyes independently, allowing assessment of efficacy in one eye before treating the other and reducing the potential for visual impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A gene therapy for vision loss (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=voretigene-neparvovec-rzyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voretigene neparvovec-rzyl</a> [Luxturna]) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December of 2017 for treating the congenital retinal degenerative disorder Leber's congenital amaurosis 2 (LCA2) in individuals with confirmed biallelic <em>RPE65</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The vector is based on an adeno-associated virus (AAV2) that delivers a wildtype human <em>RPE65</em> complementary DNA (cDNA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In preclinical studies, the vector was mainly detected in intraocular fluids, with some transient shedding in tears and serum; there were no adverse events related to the vector. Patients treated with this agent on clinical studies who have been followed for up to nine years have experienced improvements in vision without therapy-associated serious adverse effects, although there were cases of increased intraocular pressure and macular events that mostly resolved. <em>RPE65</em>-associated retinal dystrophy affects approximately 1000 to 3000 patients in the United States. The cost of this gene therapy at the time of its licensing was approximately USD $850,000 for a one-time treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinitis pigmentosa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophilia is highly amenable to gene therapy because expression of the deficient clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX) to very low levels (eg, from baseline undetectable to above 2 percent of normal with gene therapy) are sufficient to transform the clinical phenotype from one of severe, life-threatening bleeding to a mild bleeding disorder. Because the coagulation proteins circulate in the bloodstream, they can in principle be produced from one of several cell types with access to the intravascular space. A non-integrating AAV vector that targets to the liver has been the most promising, with reports describing efficacy in small numbers of patients. The use of gene therapy in hemophilia is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis#H709337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic therapies under development'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis is a single gene disorder that could be corrected or improved with gene therapy. Because the major clinical complications arise in the respiratory epithelia, delivery of the gene therapy construct could potentially be done by inhalation. This raises the possibility of repeat dosing using a non-integrating vector. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-investigational-therapies#H3393757\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Investigational therapies&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia) are an attractive target for gene therapy because production of a small amount of normal globin chains can dramatically improve red blood cell (RBC) function and raise the hemoglobin level sufficiently to reduce disease complications. However, the normal globin must be produced in developing RBC precursors, and therefore, to be clinically useful, the transgene must be introduced into HSCs that can expand sufficiently to produce enough mature RBCs. This type of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies is likely to require autologous HCT using HSCs transduced with an integrating vector. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease#H1521590660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3377103428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Gene therapy and other modifications of HCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodeficiency syndromes due to single-gene defects are good candidates for gene therapy because the missing gene can be provided in HSCs. Similar to hemoglobinopathies, this approach would likely require HCT using an integrating vector inserted into HSCs. Several conditions have been investigated, as discussed separately.

The virus is injected directly into cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions; the dose is based on the size of the lesion. Its mechanism is thought to involve recruitment and activation of immune cells to the site of the tumor. In a trial in which 436 patients were randomly assigned to receive T-VEC or subcutaneous GM-CSF, T-VEC was associated with higher rates of overall response and durable response and a trend towards better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% CI 0.62-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In a study of an oncolytic adenovirus expressing GM-CSF (Ad5-D24-GMCSF) in 16 patients with advanced solid tumors, two had complete responses, one had a partial response, and five had stable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In a phase II trial of 136 patients with head and neck cancer or nasopharyngeal carcinoma, administration of chemotherapy in combination with a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing human endostatin increased progression-free survival more than chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct tumor lysis</strong> &ndash; Oncolytic viruses are an approach to selectively or preferentially killing tumor cells due to viral replication and tumor cell lysis. Non-integrating viruses have been engineered with mutations that allow viral replication and cell lysis in tumor cells but not normal cells (ie, conditionally replicating adenoviruses).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ONYX-015 (previously called DL1520) was the first oncolytic or conditionally replicating adenovirus created. It was based on the concept that adenoviruses can kill cells by inactivating the tumor suppressor p53 via the early region 1B (E1B)-55 kD protein, but a large number of tumors lack p53; thus, the viral gene E1B could be removed, leading to a virus that is only able to replicate in and kill p53-negative cancer cells. Normal cells with wildtype p53 would be unharmed. This idea was considered to be a brilliant advance, but apparently the proposed mechanism was incorrect, because replication of the E1B-deleted virus was found to be p53 independent. ONYX-015 may be able to kill tumor cells by an unrelated mechanism, possibly involving the protein Y-box-binding factor, which is selectively expressed in cancer cells and can substitute for the function of E1B in viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Initial studies of ONYX-015 appeared promising, but the technology was subsequently sold to a company that did not perform trials that included a survival endpoint, leading to the apparently mistaken impression that the virus had limited efficacy when in fact the true efficacy remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A slightly altered version of ONYX-015 (Oncorine, previously called H101) was subsequently approved in China and licensed in 2006 for treatment of refractory nasopharyngeal cancer in combination with chemotherapy, based on a surrogate endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a randomized trial of 82 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, administration of a p53-altered adenovirus in combination with radiotherapy resulted in significantly longer disease-free survival compared with radiotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a randomized trial involving 107 patients with oral cancer, those treated with surgical resection followed by both radiotherapy and a p53 recombinant adenovirus had a lower relapse rate than those treated with surgery and radiotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. ONYX-015 and related oncolytic viruses are not approved for clinical use in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other modifications have been incorporated in order to enhance efficacy and safety. As an example, the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter was used to restrict replication of an adenovirus vector to telomerase-positive cancer cells; in an animal model, this construct inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts more efficiently than ONYX-015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Another group used a conditionally replicating adenovirus with a 24-base pair deletion in the E1 gene that targets the <span class=\"nowrap\">RB/p16</span> pathway (&quot;delta-24&quot;) that also encodes a chimeric fiber protein (Ad serotype 3) to facilitate tumor cell entry; in a mouse model of ovarian cancer, this was demonstrated to significantly improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other oncolytic viruses are under investigation. As an example, transduction of tumor cells with a &quot;suicide&quot; gene (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase [HSV-tk]) that would render them susceptible to the antiviral drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> has been proposed as a strategy for certain localized malignancies such as retinoblastoma and mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p/><p>Some trials using genetic engineering of viruses to treat cancer have used direct intratumoral injection, while other therapies such as CAR-T cells are given systemically. In principle, a genetically engineered virus or cell therapy could be administered by either route (injected into tumor cells or administered intravenously). In either case, dissemination of the virus would be critical to killing cancer cells that were not injected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> that have metastasized elsewhere in the body. Intralesional and systemic approaches have both been well tolerated, with the most common side effects including influenza-like symptoms (eg, fever, chills, malaise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/40,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47,48</a>]. An exception is the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that results from massive immune activation in individuals with a large tumor burden. These subjects and other immunotherapy strategies for cancer are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another approach to gene therapy for cancer is to protect normal (non-cancerous) cells from chemotherapy drugs, allowing higher doses of chemotherapy to be administered. As an example, some investigations have focused on introducing a drug-resistance gene into normal HSCs as a way to protect them from chemotherapy that is toxic to HSCs in the bone marrow, causing cytopenias and associated risks (eg, bleeding risk with thrombocytopenia, infectious risk with neutropenia). These hematologic toxicities are typically dose limiting for these drugs, and a source of HSCs that is resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy could allow higher doses of therapy to be administered more safely. As an example, HSCs have been transduced with a variant form of methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) that allows them to survive high doses of chemotherapy drugs metabolized by this enzyme system (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> [BCNU]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a small study, seven patients with high-grade glioblastoma treated with modified HSCs were given very high doses of chemotherapy and had improved survival compared with historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2423368700\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody gene transfer is an investigational approach to recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy that uses a gene therapy construct to produce the mAb inside the patient rather than administering the antibody directly (ie, giving the patient the antibody DNA rather than the protein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Preclinical studies of antibody gene transfer have used viral vectors as well as naked plasmid or minicircle DNA or naked messenger RNA (mRNA); these may be injected into skeletal muscle, given intravenously and allowed to home to the liver, or delivered by other routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>This approach has not been used clinically. If it were to be developed, it might have applications in treating a wide variety of conditions for which mAbs are already in clinical use, as well as other indications such as infectious diseases. As an example, intramuscular delivery of an AAV encoding a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody protected humanized mice against intravenous and intravaginal challenge with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Efficacy of this approach was also demonstrated in a simian model, although immunosuppression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> was required to sustain mAb expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Potential complications include toxicities associated with gene therapy as well as specific adverse effects related to the mAb (see <a href=\"#H1650941713\" class=\"local\">'Potential concerns with gene therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies#H3954492872\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies&quot;, section on 'Adverse events'</a>).

Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and other T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders developed in 5 of 20 children who participated in early gene therapy trials for immunodeficiency syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16</a>]. Several of these malignancies involved viral insertions near the LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) or other known proto-oncogenes. Some were effectively treated with chemotherapy, but there were some deaths. Myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemias occurred in other trial participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/17,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,57</a>]. Details of the outcomes for specific immunodeficiency syndromes are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gene therapy for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A large amount of research into vector design followed, with the goal of altering vector sequences such as promoter and enhancer sequences in the vector long-terminal repeats (LTRs) that were responsible for these genotoxic effects. Improvements have included the development of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors that lack strong enhancer sequences, the introduction of &quot;insulator sequences&quot; that separate promoters from enhancers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> promote an open chromatin configuration, and the inclusion of microRNA sequences that could block expression of the transgene in certain cell types (eg, stem cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. Subsequently, over 100 patients have been treated on clinical gene therapy trials (not including CAR-T cells) using various combinations of these enhancements, and safety appears to be greatly improved, with no adverse events related to lentiviral vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. For the most part, efficacy has been quite good. However, the risk of genotoxicity must be considered in all therapies that seek to manipulate the genome (eg, gene therapy and gene editing). (See <a href=\"#H1428384183\" class=\"local\">'Potential adverse effects and ethical concerns with gene editing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Cost may be an insurmountable barrier to gene therapy for many individuals. An AAV-based gene therapy for a rare genetic disorder was priced at approximately &euro;1 million (over USD $1 million), which has been cited as a reason for low clinical update and the eventual decision not to pursue further approval for this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. On the other hand, gene therapy for hemophilia B has been estimated to save over USD $200,000 annually for those who no longer need routine factor prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3766325633\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE EDITING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1032007713\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods and development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike gene therapy, which provides a new gene in a separate vector, gene editing involves directly altering the endogenous genomic sequence of a cell. As its name implies, gene editing is sequence-specific and seeks to make highly specific genomic sequence alterations. The target cells could in principle include any number of cell types including a pluripotent stem cell from an early stage embryo, a multipotent tissue-specific stem cell, or a mature somatic cell such as a T lymphocyte. After the genome has been edited in a dividing cell, all progeny would be expected to contain the edited version of the gene.</p><p>Editing a genetic sequence requires that the DNA be cut (eg, a double-strand break [DSB] introduced by an endonuclease enzyme) at a unique position and the two cut ends brought together or repaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116870 \">figure 1</a>). During the repair process, the original DNA sequence in the vicinity of the cut is replaced by a new, altered sequence. The new sequence is introduced using a template that is delivered into the target cell together with the endonuclease enzyme. For the therapy to be effective and safe, the precision of DNA recognition, cleavage, and repair must be extremely high, with exact in-frame changes and an absence of off-target effects (ie, changes to genes or sequence that are not the intended target). This approach has been used effectively in cellular and animal model systems. Several biologic systems and types of nucleases provide these capabilities for editing endogenous double-stranded DNA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CRISPR-Cas9</strong> &ndash; CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats) and the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) endonuclease are part of an evolutionarily conserved, ancient bacterial system for responding to viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. CRISPR arrays are regions of DNA in bacterial genomes that can be used to store genetic information from infecting viruses and mobile genetic elements. When the bacteria is reinfected with a previously encountered virus, the CRISPR sequence can be transcribed into RNA that can guide effector proteins to the homologous region in the viral genome, where it can be cleaved by endonucleases. Cas9 is one such endonuclease; there are multiple others that can locate and cleave DNA with a specific sequence (eg, Cpf1, Cas12). In the laboratory, Cas9 can be guided to virtually any DNA sequence by changing the sequence of the guide RNA (gRNA) to match the DNA sequence of interest. Optimized gRNAs can be used to make the gene targeting more specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Cas9 and gRNA can be delivered into cells using the viral and non-viral vectors described above. (See <a href=\"#H3085088483\" class=\"local\">'Types of vectors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)</strong> &ndash; A family of enzymes referred to as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) is able to cleave specific sites in DNA and can be directed to the gene of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. ZFNs were generated as hybrid proteins by fusion of a DNA-binding module composed of several zinc finger arrays with a DNA-cleaving module from the restriction endonuclease FokI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. FokI cleavage is based on dimer formation between its catalytic domains, requiring two zinc finger FokI hybrid proteins to be generated. One monomer binds to the forward DNA strand and the other monomer binds to the reverse DNA strand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Each &quot;finger&quot; recognizes approximately three base pairs of DNA, and the endonuclease can only cut DNA when two ZFNs bind to both strands of the target DNA in the correct orientation. The two FokI monomers must be in close proximity to allow dimer formation, catalytic activity, and generation of DSBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Although the specificity of ZFN binding is high due to the two hybrid proteins and intervening linker sequence, considerable engineering is required to produce zinc fingers capable of binding to any desired DNA sequence, making the process expensive, laborious, and difficult to reproduce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TALENs</strong> &ndash; Transcription activator-like (TAL) proteins are a type of protein produced by a plant pathogen (<em>Xanthomonas</em>); they are capable of altering plant gene expression. TALs can be modified to have endonuclease activity by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain (composed of 33 to 35 amino acid repeats) to a DNA cleavage domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These complexes are termed TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases). Similar to ZFNs, the sequence-independent FokI enzyme functions as a site-specific nuclease, and TALENs can efficiently induce DSBs that require repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) in human pluripotent stem cells and somatic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TALENs have the ability to recognize specific DNA sequences through two hypervariable amino acid residues at positions 12 and 13, termed repeat-variable di-residues (RVDs). Although TALENs can be engineered for virtually any sequence, their use is limited by the necessity of engineering novel proteins for each target site, similar to ZFNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Similar to CRISPR-Cas9 and ZFNs, TALENs are delivered into cells using the delivery vectors described above (see <a href=\"#H3085088483\" class=\"local\">'Types of vectors'</a> above). However, in vivo delivery of TALENs is hampered by their large size (approximately 3 kb for a single TALEN) and the repetitive nature of TALEN arrays, leading to packaging difficulties into certain viral delivery systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H125745848\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of the vector backbone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Once the endogenous DNA sequence has been cut, the edits are made by the cell as the sequence is repaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116870 \">figure 1</a>). One of two major cellular DNA repair mechanisms is triggered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Homology-directed repair</strong> &ndash; HDR uses a new sequence template to repair DSBs, thereby introducing a new sequence that can correct deleterious variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This process allows for precise editing at the DNA level. The template for the repair can be provided as a donor DNA (eg, a single-strand oligonucleotide DNA with the desired sequence) together with the endonuclease; the cellular DNA repair machinery uses the template during repair of the DSB. This method is favored in most applications because it provides the greatest precision.

The indels can potentially disrupt target genes by altering the reading frame, in turn causing RNA degradation or production of a nonfunctional protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. NHEJ can be used to disrupt a disease-causing gene that is overexpressed or that acts by a dominant negative mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Alternatively, NHEJ can be used to restore the reading frame of a mutated gene. As an example, in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx mouse), NHEJ has been used to create in-frame removal of exons 20 to 23, thus preventing the transcription of a missense variant in exon 23 that results in a premature stop codon and disruption of dystrophin expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, the related phenomenon of micro-homologous end-joining (MHEJ) may be used to fuse two DNA strands together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Unlike NHEJ, MHEJ uses short homology sequences near the DNA break to align the broken ends.

One study estimated that the likelihood of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) creating off-target sites in a human genome would be approximately 1.5 to 8.5 percent, depending on the genome and site-selection method; however, mutations may be rare at targeted sites or may not have functional consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245158499\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE SILENCING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369716712\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike gene therapy and gene editing, gene silencing does not add to or alter the primary genetic information in the patient's cells; rather, it aims to use molecular methods to reduce the expression level of one or more genes, shutting down expression of a defective dominant gene with or without provision of a wildtype allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

These dsRNAs, also called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), can bind tightly by antisense base pairing to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to which they have homologous sequence. This causes the mRNAs to be degraded, which in turn reduces their translation into proteins (ie, reduces their expression). RNAi is thought to be a type of immune defense against invading genetic material as well as an alternative form of gene regulation that can be turned on or off during development.</p><p>The sequence-specific silencing of genes by RNAi can be triggered by different types of RNAs including siRNAs, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as long ncRNAs and pyknons (repeated elements frequently found in the 3' untranslated regions of genes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gene-therapy-gene-editing-and-gene-silencing/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>The process of RNAi commences with the processing of long dsRNA and complex hairpin precursors into shorter duplexes, or siRNAs, by the enzyme Dicer.

Gene therapy involves the introduction of a new gene; gene editing involves altering the primary DNA sequence of an existing gene; and gene silencing uses genetic techniques to reduce the expression level of a gene. These therapies can be targeted to a variety of cell types, and they can be introduced into cells outside the body or administered directly to the patient. There are a number of types of vectors available with different properties (eg, integrating versus non-integrating, more or less immunogenic). Advantages and disadvantages of some of the commonly used vectors are described above. (See <a href=\"#H561218708\" class=\"local\">'Basic concepts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For monogenic disorders in which an individual has inherited a pathogenic gene variant, gene therapy may be used to provide a normal copy of the gene or a modified version of a gene with special properties such as increased activity. (See <a href=\"#H1458528863\" class=\"local\">'Genetic disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cancer immunotherapy, gene therapy can provide the patient's T cells with a modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that brings T cells and tumor cells in close proximity to enhance tumor cell killing. Oncolytic adenoviral vectors can selectively replicate in tumor cells, leading to cell lysis or increased sensitivity to chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H389923011\" class=\"local\">'Cancer therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene therapy has also been proposed as a method for delivering therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). (See <a href=\"#H2423368700\" class=\"local\">'Antibody delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major concern of gene therapy is genotoxicity (introduction of deleterious abnormalities in other genes); this resulted in leukemia in early gene therapy trials. A second concern is the potential for immunogenicity, which can result in acute inflammatory reactions, sometimes severe, and which can possibly lead to rejection of the gene therapy vector. These concerns have been substantively addressed by modifying gene therapy vectors, leading to a small number of therapies being approved for clinical use in the United States in 2017. (See <a href=\"#H1650941713\" class=\"local\">'Potential concerns with gene therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene editing involves the site-specific alteration of an existing gene. Editing the genetic sequence requires that a region of DNA be cut by an endonuclease (eg, CRISPR-Cas9 system) and the two cut ends brought together, often with a new or corrected sequence inserted between them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116870\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116870 \">figure 1</a>). Preclinical studies have been performed, and there are a number of clinical settings in which gene editing may be useful, as discussed above. Clinical trials using CRISPR-edited cells for cancer therapy began in 2018. For the therapy to be effective and safe, the precision of DNA recognition, cleavage, and repair must be extremely high; concerns about the fidelity of editing need to be addressed before this approach is used clinically. Ethical issues with gene editing mainly apply to editing in human embryos. (See <a href=\"#H3766325633\" class=\"local\">'Gene editing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene silencing uses molecular methods (eg, introduction of an antisense oligonucleotide [ASO] or short hairpin RNA [shRNA]) that take advantage of the evolutionarily conserved machinery to degrade messenger RNA and in turn reduce the expression level of a gene or group of genes. Several gene silencing therapies are clinically available or under development.
