Although small bowel obstruction is more common, large bowel obstruction occurs in approximately 25 percent of all intestinal obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Obstruction can be functional (due to abnormal intestinal physiology) or due to a mechanical obstruction, which can be partial or complete. Depending upon the time course of development of the obstruction, symptoms related to colorectal (large bowel or rectum) obstruction can present acutely with abdominal pain and obstipation, or more chronically as a progressive change in bowel habits. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of mechanical colorectal obstruction are reviewed here. Fecal impaction is considered a form of functional obstruction and is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-the-older-adult#H523121797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Fecal impaction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60187985\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel obstruction occurs when the normal flow of intraluminal contents is interrupted. Obstruction can be functional (due to abnormal intestinal physiology) or due to a mechanical obstruction (extrinsic or intrinsic [mural or intraluminal]), and can be partial or complete.</p><p>On average, patients with acute symptoms present after an average of five days of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This delay may be related to the nature of the symptoms with abdominal distention and discomfort from progressive colonic distention possibly better tolerated compared with abdominal pain and vomiting associated with small bowel obstruction.</p><p>Approximately 70 percent of large bowel obstructions occur at or distal to the transverse colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100580\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100580 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Tumors at the hepatic flexure are the least common. Tumors of the splenic flexure are more likely to result in obstructive symptoms. Perforation may also be present and occurs more commonly at the point of obstruction, most likely due to local tumor invasion or inflammatory reaction, rather than in the proximal, dilated colon. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194983497\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In spite of widespread screening for colorectal cancer, large bowel obstruction is the initial presenting symptom of colon cancer in up to 30 percent of cases, particularly for more distal colon and rectal tumors, which tend to obstruct earlier due to the smaller size of the colonic lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The most common cause of colorectal obstruction leading to emergent surgery (70 percent) is rectosigmoid, rectal, or anal malignancy; approximately 10 percent of patients presenting with colonic obstruction have rectal cancer; an additional 5 percent have anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The median age of patients presenting with obstruction due to colorectal cancer is 73 years. </p><p>The most common benign cause of colorectal obstruction is volvulus (5 to 15 percent), with sigmoid volvulus the most common etiology of large bowel obstruction in the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Other causes include postoperative adhesions, strictures due to repetitive bouts of diverticular disease (1.7 to 10 percent), and hernia with colonic incarceration (2.5 percent). Rarer benign etiologies include inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, adhesions, bezoars, intussusception, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Also, case reports have described symptoms of colonic obstruction caused by appendiceal mucocele, urinary retention, gallstone ileus, endometriosis, and mycobacterium tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/3,4,11-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11-21</a>]. Smaller colonic lesions can occasionally lead to obstruction by causing secondary intussusception. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60187978\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology and risk factors for conditions most commonly associated with colorectal obstruction are discussed fully in the linked topics. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction complicates up to 30 percent of colorectal cancers; however, noncolonic neoplasms such as pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and lymphoma cause approximately 10 percent of colorectal obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/3,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-24</a>]. Risk factors for these cancers are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-ovarian-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for ovarian cancer&quot;, section on 'Factors that affect risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior abdominal surgery can lead to adhesive bowel disease, and although small bowel obstruction is more common, adhesive large bowel obstruction can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-peritoneal-adhesions-in-adults-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative peritoneal adhesions in adults and their prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior colorectal resection can also be complicated by stricture formation. The incidence of stricture after colorectal anastomosis has been reported between 3 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Stricture is mild and usually asymptomatic in the majority, and may be discovered during routine surveillance colonoscopy, but can lead to symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Because the single most important risk factor for anastomotic stricture is anastomotic leak associated with sepsis and fibrosis, it is not surprising that more distal anastomoses (with their attendant increased risk of leak) have higher incidences of postoperative strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H800412\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Strictures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated bouts of intestinal inflammation can also cause strictures from diseases such as from diverticulitis (1.7 to 10 percent), sequelae of ischemic colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-diverticulitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute diverticulitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the small bowel is more commonly involved in abdominal wall hernias, colonic incarceration occurs in approximately 2.5 percent. Rare sliding hernias have also caused obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal wall hernias in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic or physiologic abnormalities of the colon may contribute to the development of volvulus (cecal, sigmoid). The most common benign cause of large intestinal obstruction is volvulus, accounting for 5 to 15 percent. Fecal impaction, commonly due to chronic constipation, can also obstruct the colon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sigmoid-volvulus#H860167114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sigmoid volvulus&quot;, section on 'Colonic dysmotility'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cecal-volvulus#H12330622\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cecal volvulus&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of benign conditions can lead to rectal stenosis, including inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, suppository use, radiotherapy, fibrosis due to endometriosis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and postoperative stricture, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194983524\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients<strong> </strong>with colorectal obstruction can present acutely with a relatively abrupt onset of abdominal distension and abdominal pain from sudden luminal obstruction, or subacutely or chronically with a change in bowel habits over a period of time due to progressive luminal narrowing. Longer duration of symptoms and associated symptoms such as unintentional weight loss or rectal bleeding may suggest a malignant cause rather than a benign etiology. </p><p>The history should seek to identify risk factors for colorectal obstruction, which will provide clues to the potential etiology of suspected bowel obstruction or suggest an alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H194983497\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H76779252\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76779339\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute obstruction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627662353\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of acute complete and near-complete mechanical colorectal obstruction are bloating, abdominal pain, and obstipation. Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting may or may not accompany these symptoms, but is more likely with proximal colonic obstruction, which can mimic small bowel obstruction. Abdominal pain is described as infraumbilical and cramping with paroxysms of pain occurring every 20 to 30 minutes. </p><p>In a review of patients with large bowel volvulus, the most frequent symptoms of obstruction were abdominal pain (58 percent) and obstipation (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While most patients with sigmoid volvulus presented with distention (79 percent), most patients with cecal volvulus presented with abdominal pain, which occurred in 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The average symptom duration for patients with sigmoid volvulus was 38 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>Focal abdominal pain may indicate peritoneal irritation due to ischemia or colonic necrosis, whereas a sudden relief of pain followed by a progressive worsening of pain may relate to intestinal perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia#H278244257\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;, section on 'Acute colonic ischemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain in the low pelvis may be due to rectal tenesmus as a sign of rectal obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627662381\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should evaluate the patient overall for systemic signs. Although more commonly associated with acute mechanical small bowel obstruction, patients with colorectal obstruction, particularly those with a delayed presentation, may have signs of dehydration, shock, or even abdominal compartment syndrome from severe colonic distention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Abdominal inspection will usually show abdominal distention, which can be particularly dramatic for distal complete obstructions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627662466\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory studies in patients who present with abdominal pain typically include a complete blood count with differential, electrolytes including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. These studies are not specific for a diagnosis of colorectal obstruction but can help to assess the presence and severity of hypovolemia or other metabolic abnormalities, and leukocytosis with a leftward shift may indicate the presence of complications.</p><p>For patients found on imaging studies to have a lesion consistent with malignancy of the colon, we obtain a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. Although an elevated CEA level is strongly suggestive of a malignant etiology, in and of itself, it is not diagnostic of colorectal cancer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76779352\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive partial colorectal obstruction typically presents as a progressive change in bowel habits, typically over weeks to months. A change in bowel habits associated with unintentional weight loss over the same period is suggestive of malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in the older adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H2934828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Symptoms from the local tumor'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76779239\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of colorectal obstruction may be suspected based upon typical symptoms of abdominal pain, distention, and obstipation in a patient with appropriate risk factors; however, a definitive diagnosis generally requires imaging studies to distinguish large from small bowel obstruction, judge whether the obstruction is partial or complete, identify the location of the obstruction, and determine a possible etiology. For those with malignancy, imaging also identifies associated regional and metastatic disease.</p><p>Plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen are the most practical and useful imaging studies. Some have argued that abdominal CT should be performed preferentially over plain abdominal films. However, plain radiography is more readily and universally available and less expensive than abdominal CT. </p><p>Plain films may demonstrate characteristic findings of volvulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67675 \">image 1</a>), including such signs as the &quot;northern exposure&quot; sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and the &quot;coffee bean&quot; sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], or may demonstrate pneumoperitoneum. Although there is a common belief that the apex of the loop of sigmoid volvulus classically points to the right upper quadrant, one study found equal numbers of patients with sigmoid loops pointing to the midline and left side as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Each of these radiographic signs may be sufficient to initiate intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, plain abdominal radiographs are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Plain abdominal radiographs alone lack adequate sensitivity and may miss a diagnosis of volvulus in up to one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H76779252\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>For hemodynamically stable patients without symptoms or radiographic signs indicating the need for immediate intervention, we obtain abdominal CT, which is highly sensitive and specific for detecting colorectal obstruction (each &gt;90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. CT accurately distinguishes between true colonic obstruction and pseudo-obstruction, and can accurately diagnose intraluminal, intrinsic, and extrinsic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/13,36,37,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36,37,40,41</a>]. Abdominal CT is also the most common and the more accurate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus. False positive findings may be due to ileus with right colonic dilatation or splenic flexure localized spasm. (See <a href=\"#H76779252\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Signs of colorectal obstruction on abdominal CT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transition point with proximal dilated colon (&gt;8 cm) and collapsed distal colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraluminal colon or rectal mass. The &quot;apple core&quot; lesion as a radiographic sign of colonic malignancy is usually described in association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, but has also been described with abdominal CT. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of sigmoid volvulus include the &quot;X-marks-the-spot&quot; sign, which is the observation of two crossing transition points arising from a single location, and the &quot;split-wall&quot; sign, which describes a separation of the wall of the sigmoid (by mesenteric fat) as a result of incomplete folding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93452%7EGAST%2F93453\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93452 graphicRef93453 \">image 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/13,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT is also useful in distinguishing between sigmoid and cecal volvulus, which is important, since the initial treatment may differ because of the different endoscopic success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Cecal bascule, as a sign of cecal volvulus, can be seen on plain films or CT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87137\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87137 \">image 3</a>). </p><p/><p>For patients identified with tumor as the cause of obstruction, abdominal CT can identify multifocal disease, metastatic disease, ascites, or carcinomatosis, which alter surgical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Synchronous tumors occur in up to 10 percent of patients with obstructing colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Lower endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy) is not usually needed as an initial diagnostic modality for acute colorectal obstruction, but can aid in the diagnosis of those with chronic symptoms for whom large bowel obstruction cannot be excluded on plain films or abdominal CT. Lower endoscopy may also be needed to evaluate findings on imaging suggestive of synchronous tumor, which occur in up to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>With the accuracy of abdominal CT and the ability to evaluate the entire abdomen, lower gastrointestinal studies are rarely needed to establish an initial diagnosis of mechanical colorectal obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76779252\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign diseases simulating large bowel obstruction include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, and Ogilvie's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Abdominal CT accurately distinguishes true colonic obstruction from pseudo-obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H76779239\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bowel obstruction &ndash; Compared with small bowel obstruction, pain associated with colorectal obstruction occurs at a greater time interval and occurs lower in the abdomen between the umbilicus and pubic tubercle. Lower abdominal pain and abdominal distention are characteristic of mechanical colorectal obstruction. A history of prior abdominal surgery suggests small bowel obstruction, unless the patient underwent a prior colonic resection. Similarly, the presence of hernia or history of hernia repair suggests small bowel more than large bowel obstruction.

This entity is commonly associated with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>; thus, the patient usually has a history of antibiotic use<em>.</em> In addition, these patients are often quite ill and can have systemic signs (ie, sepsis) in the absence of colonic perforation. Systemic signs are not seen with typical etiologies of mechanical colorectal obstruction unless the colon has already perforated.

Mildly symptomatic anal strictures may be managed in an outpatient setting if they do not present with large bowel obstruction. Strictures severe enough to cause symptoms of large bowel obstruction are generally managed in the hospital setting. Treatment options for patients with anastomotic stricture involving the colon include transanal strictureplasty with electrocautery or laser, dilation, stenting, and surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Subsequent treatment depends upon the etiology and location of the obstruction, medical comorbidities of the patient, as well as local resources and expertise of the available clinicians. Unlike the majority of small bowel obstructions, which can be successfully managed nonoperatively, approximately 75 percent of large bowel obstructions ultimately require surgical intervention, whether emergently, urgently, or electively during the same hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60194510\"><span class=\"h2\">Decompression of sigmoid volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with imaging signs of sigmoid volvulus, <span class=\"nowrap\">gastroenterology/colorectal</span> surgery consultation should be obtained. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally suggested to initially decompress the colon to allow for semielective surgery (rather than as an emergency) and may be the only treatment in high-risk patients. However, for patients able to tolerate an operation, elective resection during the same hospital stay is recommended for sigmoid volvulus because of the high rate of recurrence (up to 50 percent) with endoscopic decompression alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Stenting is predominantly used for malignant large bowel obstruction, mostly for left-sided lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although there have been reports that stenting of right-sided disease is often unsuccessful, specialized centers have reported reasonable success rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].

This provides a window of time prior to surgery to correct fluid depletion and electrolytes, and allow for mechanical bowel preparation prior to surgery, thereby performing surgery under elective, rather than emergent, circumstances. In most series, the average time from stent deployment to surgery was seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The benefit of this approach is to potentially allow for resection and primary anastomosis (one-stage operation) rather than ostomy (two-stage operation). Additionally, decompression and optimization may allow for a less invasive (ie, laparoscopic) operative procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The additional time before operation also allows for complete oncologic staging.

The toughest decision facing the surgeon is whether or not to perform a primary reanastomosis at the index exploratory operation. This decision is determined by weighing the perceived risk of anastomotic leakage against the morbidity of externalizing a stoma. Leak rates for resection and primary anastomosis are low in modern series at approximately 5 percent for either right or left colectomy, which contrasts sharply with historic series that reported anastomotic leak in up to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/2,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,70,71</a>].

For right-sided lesions there is general consensus that the most appropriate treatment is resection with primary anastomosis as a single-stage procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In general, primary resection and immediate anastomosis is also preferred over staged resection for uncomplicated left-sided obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Nevertheless, for patients with a short life expectancy who are high-risk surgical candidates, cecostomy may still be a reasonable option (right- or left-sided lesions). The procedure is performed using local anesthetic in an interventional suite or operating room using fluoroscopic guidance. For left-sided lesions, colonic stenting is a better option if the lesion is accessible and providing that an appropriately-experienced endoscopist is available to perform the procedure.

Obstruction can be functional (due to abnormal intestinal physiology) or due to a mechanical obstruction, which can be partial or complete. Mechanical colorectal obstruction can be due to a variety of etiologies, both benign and malignant. Large bowel obstruction is the initial presenting symptom of colon cancer in up to 30 percent of cases, particularly for more distal colon and rectal tumors. The most common benign cause of colorectal obstruction is volvulus. (See <a href=\"#H60187985\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H194983497\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main risk factors for colorectal obstruction include known risk for colorectal cancer, prior abdominal surgery, prior colorectal resection, repeated bouts of intestinal inflammation, abdominal wall hernia, and anatomic abnormalities predisposing to volvulus (cecal, sigmoid). (See <a href=\"#H194983497\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the time course of development of the obstruction, symptoms related to colorectal obstruction can present acutely with abdominal pain and obstipation, or more chronically. Progressive partial colorectal obstruction typically presents as a progressive change in bowel habits, typically over weeks to months, which if associated with unintentional weight loss over the same period is suggestive of malignancy. Symptoms depend on location within the gastrointestinal tract with right-sided obstruction presenting more often with nausea and vomiting similar to small bowel obstruction. The presentation of more distal obstructions is often delayed due to the capacity of the large intestine. (See <a href=\"#H194983524\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of colorectal obstruction may be suspected based upon typical symptoms in a patient with appropriate risk factors, but a definitive diagnosis generally requires imaging studies to distinguish large from small bowel obstruction, judge whether the obstruction is partial or complete, identify the location of the obstruction, and determine a possible etiology. For those with malignancy, imaging also identifies associated regional and metastatic disease. For patients who present with perforation, the diagnosis will necessarily be made in the operating room. (See <a href=\"#H76779239\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hemodynamically stable patients without symptoms or radiographic signs indicating the need for immediate intervention (eg, perforation), we recommend abdominal CT, which is highly sensitive and specific for detecting colorectal obstruction and accurately distinguishes between true colonic obstruction and pseudo-obstruction. Signs of colorectal obstruction on abdominal CT include: proximal dilated, collapsed distal colon with a transition point, intraluminal mass, and signs associated with volvulus (x-marks the spot, split wall). For patients identified with tumor as the cause of obstruction, abdominal CT can identify multifocal disease, metastatic disease, ascites, or carcinomatosis, all of which alter surgical decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H76779239\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H76779252\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients identified with acute mechanical colorectal obstruction should generally be admitted to the hospital. Initial management consists of supportive care that includes gastrointestinal decompression for patients with nausea or vomiting and intravenous fluid therapy with correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Subsequent treatment depends upon the etiology and location of the obstruction, the medical comorbidities of the patient, as well as the local resources and expertise of the available clinicians. Some patients may be candidates for endoscopic treatments (eg, decompression for volvulus, stenting for malignant obstruction). (See <a href=\"#H194983564\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute complete or near complete colorectal obstruction (benign or malignant etiology) is an urgent surgical problem. Whether to choose a single-stage, two-stage, or three-stage procedure depends upon the location of the obstructing lesion, condition of the proximal colon, and medical comorbidities of the patient, their life expectancy, goals of care, and presence of proximal perforation. Specific procedures include ostomy alone for fecal diversion (initial or palliative), colectomy with primary anastomosis with or without proximal diverting ostomy, and the Hartmann procedure. Whenever possible, we use a one-stage curative procedure for right or left-sided colon obstruction, whether benign or malignant, rather than a staged procedure. (See <a href=\"#H627658931\" class=\"local\">'Procedures to manage colorectal obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subtotal colectomy, rather than a segmental resection, should generally be performed when a distal obstructing lesion presents in combination with a more proximal colonic perforation, serosal tearing or ischemic changes from severe colonic distention, or synchronous polyps. (See <a href=\"#H627659327\" class=\"local\">'Segmental resection versus subtotal colectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative (30-day) morbidity and mortality for obstructing lesions are similar for benign versus malignant pathology, though for obvious reasons long-term mortality is worse for malignancy. Laparoscopic surgery has been reported to be feasible and safe for patients with colorectal obstruction with similar rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality as open surgery. Patients undergoing emergency surgery for colorectal malignancies have significantly worse outcomes than those undergoing elective resection. (See <a href=\"#H194983704\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Markogiannakis H, Messaris E, Dardamanis D, et al.
