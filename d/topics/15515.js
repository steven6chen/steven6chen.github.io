The questions of whether &ndash; and how &ndash; to disclose these secondary findings (also called incidental findings) from genetic testing have generated much debate, and the importance of how these questions are answered is expected to grow as laboratories and physicians transition to whole genome and whole exome sequencing rather than targeted gene panels.</p><p>This topic review discusses an approach to the disclosure of secondary findings from genetic testing.</p><p>Overviews of related subjects are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genomic disorders &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next generation DNA sequencing &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counselling &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glossary of terms &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70129\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION OF VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term secondary finding (SF; also called &quot;unexpected result&quot; or &quot;incidental finding) has been defined in several different ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Narrowly defined, secondary findings are genetic variants that are unrelated to the original reason genetic testing was ordered. Here, we use a broad definition of secondary findings that includes health-informative variants that may have been identified through untargeted scans for any genetic findings of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Secondary findings can be identified by any genetic test, including single gene tests and microarray analysis. However, secondary findings are likely to be identified during testing with genomic sequencing methods such as whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing that assay all genes, as opposed to methods that assay only one or a few genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H358242275\" class=\"local\">'Decisions made by the laboratory'</a> below.)</p><p>Most laboratories classify variants in categories such as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenic</strong> &ndash; Pathogenic variants are variants previously reported in patients with disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are strongly suspected of being pathogenic based on preclinical studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Likely Pathogenic</strong> &ndash; Likely pathogenic variants are those with sequence features that are likely to be implicated in disease pathogenesis but for which conclusive evidence of pathogenicity is not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variant of unknown significance</strong> &ndash; Variants of unknown significance (VUS; also called &quot;variant of uncertain significance&quot; or &quot;finding of unknown clinical significance&quot;) are variants that have some features suggestive of possible functional consequence, but for which there is insufficient evidence for either a pathogenic or benign role.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Likely benign</strong> &ndash; Likely benign variants are those for which weak data supporting pathogenicity may be available, but for which the majority of evidence suggests the effect of the variant is benign.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benign</strong> &ndash; Benign findings are genetic variants not predicted to alter gene expression or function.</p><p/><p>Decisions about whether to report a variant as a secondary finding and how to classify the variant are made by individual laboratories, sometimes without input from ordering physicians or patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;pathogenic variant&quot; is preferred over &quot;mutation&quot; since it provides greater clarity about whether a DNA change is disease-causing or benign and allows a uniform nomenclature to be used; a 2015 guidance document from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology has recommended that this terminology be applied to all genetic testing (not just to secondary findings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An often-cited list of 59 genes published by ACMG (updated in 2016 from the original 56 genes [four genes added; one removed]) represents a minimal list of genes recommended for examination for secondary findings based on criteria that emphasize consensus-based clinical validity (ie, the accuracy with which the finding predicts disease risk or presence) and utility (ie, the ability to use the findings to impact clinical management, and risks and benefits resulting from test use) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97842 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. ACMG plans to periodically update its recommended list of genes that laboratories should proactively examine during sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other groups have generated local criteria for reportable findings that would alter clinical management, such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) and Fabry disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues has recommended that professional organizations deliberate and provide specific guidance for different fields and contexts, rather than endorsing a uniform obligation across varied contexts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Of note, recommendations such as the ACMG list provide a list of genes to be examined for variants, rather than specific variants within those genes that should be reported, and specialists often disagree whether specific variants warrant reporting as secondary findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Moreover, even when a gene's association with disease risk is well established, penetrance estimates may have been developed from high-risk populations, and these estimates may generalize poorly to different groups such as healthy individuals in the general population.

The MedSeq project examined approximately 4500 genes using expanded reporting criteria and, ignoring actionability criteria, identified pathogenic variants associated with monogenic disease in 13 of 50 healthy adults (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70143\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consensus exists that patients should be informed about the potential for identifying secondary findings prior to undergoing genetic testing, including what kinds of findings could be detected, which findings would be disclosed, and how the information would be communicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Discussions between patients and providers about genomic findings should culminate in joint decisions that account for the patient's clinical status, values, and stated preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>]. In the cases where genomic sequencing is used, ACMG recommends counseling by a medical geneticist or genetic counselor prior to testing; this would include notification that secondary findings may be identified and clarification about what kinds of findings would be disclosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Patients should also be provided an &quot;opt out&quot; option in which laboratories would restrict bioinformatics analysis to genes relevant to the reasons testing was ordered. Individuals may also opt out of disclosure of secondary findings after analysis has occurred. The advantages and disadvantages of opting out of genetic analysis versus disclosure of results are complex and raise a number of ethical issues. Many experts believe that an individual who wishes to opt out of receiving certain findings is better served by opting out of genomic analysis, in order to preserve patient privacy. In two large studies that used exome sequencing for diagnosis in suspected genomic disorders, 1 to 8 percent of individuals opted out of receiving information on secondary findings, with the higher percentage of opt outs for information about recessive disorders and pharmacogenomic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/10,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,29</a>]. Regardless of whether a patient has chosen to opt out of genetic analysis or disclosure, ordering physicians may inform patients that their preferences for receiving secondary findings will be re-assessed at the time when primary findings are disclosed.</p><p>The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) has released a statement emphasizing the importance of pretest counseling to ensure patients make informed decisions about receiving results related to secondary findings, particularly from genomic sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Suggested components of pretest counseling include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain the information that may be returned, including unexpected and unsolicited information about risks of cancer and cardiac disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gather the patient's family history and discuss risks that arise in the family history.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss the limitations of analysis for secondary findings. (See <a href=\"#H70164\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of &quot;negative&quot; results'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Importantly, genomic sequencing does not substitute for family history analysis in assessing disease risk. This was illustrated in a study that compared family history&ndash;based risk assessment with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based testing for breast, prostate, and colon cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Family history&ndash;based assessment classified 22 of 88 participants as high-risk, while SNP-based testing only identified one high-risk patient.</p><p>Informed consent for sequencing and the accompanying analysis of secondary findings should also include discussions of the likelihood of detecting additional variants, the types of findings that will and will not be disclosed, the patient's preferences for learning these types of information, and a plan for disclosing the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Potential harms of disclosure of secondary findings include psychological distress from learning of disease risk, financial and personal costs of additional testing that may be indicated, and adverse consequences of therapeutic interventions for which evidence of benefit is lacking in patients diagnosed incidentally:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with all genetic test results, federal legislation protects patients from discrimination related to employment or health insurance, but similar protections are lacking for other types of insurance (eg, life, disability, and long-term care insurance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be additional psychological harms from learning about a risk of disease for which there is no effective intervention (eg, Huntington disease), or risks to privacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, physicians' experiences with and understandings about genetics are often limited, raising risks that reports of secondary findings will be misinterpreted, particularly if the finding relates to a rare condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Conversely, a report of no secondary findings detected may falsely reassure an individual that <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> is not at risk of disease and cause the individual to ignore personal symptoms or a strong family history of disease. Of note, the evidence threshold laboratories use for reporting a variant to physicians and patients tends to be much higher in the context of secondary findings compared with variants being analyzed for diagnostic purposes. (See <a href=\"#H70164\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of &quot;negative&quot; results'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The potential for psychological distress may vary according to disease risk, availability of prevention strategies, and whether the results were anticipated or not. An example of a setting in which distress was not increased comes from a trial involving 257 adults who were interested in learning about genetic risk for late onset Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Participants had genotyping of their apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) gene, which is associated with risk of late onset AD and risk of cardiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive information only about their associated AD risk, or about their AD risk plus their risk for cardiac disease, based on <em>APOE </em>genotype. Compared with controls, those assigned to receive additional unexpected information about increased cardiac risk had lower scores for test-related distress; scores for anxiety and depression were well below clinically significant cutoffs in all participants. In addition, test-related distress was lower among those who learned they were at increased risk for both cardiac disease and AD compared with those who learned about an increased risk for AD only. An editorialist noted that low psychological distress may not be the most compelling reason for disclosure, and suggested a framework for population-based prioritization of results for disclosure that would be based on the predictive value of genetic risk information and the availability of highly effective prevention strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A final consideration for the consenting process is what to do with secondary findings after death. Patients and research participants often express wishes that any genetic risk information about them be shared with relatives after their death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, in the United States, health privacy regulations in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibit such disclosure without prior authorization from the decedent or a legal representative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Addressing this issue during the informed consent process may help patients initiate discussions with relatives about whether they would want to receive postmortem disclosure of secondary findings, along with any other medical information that might be critical to interpreting the clinical significance of a potentially disease-associated variant. (See <a href=\"#H358243956\" class=\"local\">'Postmortem disclosure'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional ethical and psychosocial issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70150\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCLOSURE OF SECONDARY FINDINGS TO PATIENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358242275\"><span class=\"h2\">Decisions made by the laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each laboratory performing genomic testing makes decisions regarding which results are reported to the clinician. Unlike more straightforward clinical laboratory testing (eg, measurement of a serum protein concentration), genomic testing measures sequence variation at the nucleotide level in a very large portion of the genome; laboratories determining genetic sequence information are responsible for providing the interpretation of the clinical relevance of the variants identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each laboratory typically has its own policies for identifying, analyzing, and reporting secondary findings. When genomic sequencing is used, a laboratory may have a pre-specified panel of genes it will examine for and report variants for unless instructed to do otherwise by the ordering physician; in some cases, laboratories may have a policy in place to allow clinicians or patients to opt out of receiving secondary findings or to allow them to receive an expanded panel of results upon request (eg, carrier status variants, pharmacogenomic variants). Laboratories have also been encouraged to develop policies about disclosing secondary findings to parents or other third parties, although consensus is lacking about what these policies should be [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Laboratories are also encouraged to establish criteria and thresholds for reporting findings associated with consanguinity, such as multiple regions of extended homozygosity, because these findings can increase risks for autosomal recessive conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. In circumstances where genetic testing results suggest possible conception between first- or second-degree relatives, laboratories are encouraged to discuss their findings with the clinician who ordered the test, because the clinician may have legal obligations for reporting potential rape or sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each laboratory decides what risk assessment to assign to each variant within the gene; this is generally done according to an accepted classification scheme based on the likely clinical significance of each variant (see <a href=\"#H70129\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and classification of variants'</a> above). Interpretations of risk are generally made by reviewing published <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proprietary epidemiologic, genetic, and biologic data, and using algorithms to predict the functional significance of certain variants. Patient information (eg, laboratory results, personal and family history of disease) may also inform how variants are classified.</p><p/><p>Recommendations for conditions and genes to query for variants usually consider the existence of validated screening procedures to confirm the presence or absence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ACMG has identified a list of 59 genes (updated from an earlier list of 56 genes) that are associated with 24 conditions that it considers a minimal set for which known or likely pathogenic variants should be reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97842 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. There are plans for this list to be updated periodically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/9,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,44,45</a>].</p><p>There may be relatively broad consensus in reporting a known pathogenic variant in a known cancer gene (eg, pathogenic BRCA1 mutation). However, laboratory assessments regarding the significance of a variant may diverge when the pathogenicity of the variant has not been established previously. This divergence in assessments was illustrated in a study that compared results from two genomics laboratories using a genotype-panel to test DNA from five individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The information reporting the genetic sequence was concordant for more than 99 percent of markers tested, but the risk prediction was concordant across all five subjects for only 4 of 13 medical conditions. Of note, this study evaluated susceptibility variants for common conditions as well as Mendelian diseases, which may have contributed to the high degree of disparity in risk predictions.</p><p>Most laboratories will report a genomic finding if the sequence variant is &quot;previously reported and is a recognized cause of the disorder&quot; (ie, pathogenic), and many will report a variant that is &quot;previously unreported and is of the type which is expected to cause the disorder&quot; (ie, likely pathogenic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, estimates of the predictive value of testing, penetrance of specific variants, spectrum of possible phenotypes, and efficacy of interventions may have been developed from research on sick patients and may not generalize well to asymptomatic populations. Laboratories should consider the patient's baseline risk and ethnic background when they assess the pathogenicity of a particular variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Experts have called for the development of standards for the identification and reporting of secondary findings from genomic testing, and recommendations continue to evolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In the interim, individual laboratories are encouraged to develop clear policies based on their own assessment of existing evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. In all situations, laboratories are strongly encouraged to set high thresholds for defining pathogenicity for patients who have no prior personal or family history suggesting a condition with a strong genetic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Physicians will need to take these considerations into account when they decide whether and how to disclose secondary findings to their patients. (See <a href=\"#H1593125\" class=\"local\">'Review patient report'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593125\"><span class=\"h2\">Review patient report</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to meeting with the patient, the clinician should do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review patient preferences communicated at the time of consent for genomic testing (eg, did the patient opt out of receiving certain results?).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weigh the potential harms and benefits of reporting the secondary finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the clinical implications of the finding for the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reevaluate the patient's personal medical history, family history, and physical examination in light of the finding, if appropriate.</p><p/><p>Importantly, patient preferences for information and the clinical significance of a secondary finding from genetic testing may change over time. The decision about whether and when to disclose secondary findings will thus depend on the clinical context and the judgment of clinicians involved in the patient's care. Additionally, ethical obligations to respect patients' autonomy and right not to know information must be weighed against fiduciary duties to inform patients of potentially life-saving information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/50-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-56</a>]. In the United States, a Presidential Commission has urged professional organizations to develop guidelines for responding to secondary findings from genomic testing that address these ethical and legal issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent#H16860353\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;, section on 'The duty to inform'</a> and <a href=\"#H358246782\" class=\"local\">'Liability concerns'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, physicians will need to consider the secondary finding in the context of the patient's primary reason for testing. As an example, patients for whom testing was done for a more immediate problem may be unreceptive to learning about additional results or poorly able to process the information until the primary indication for genomic testing has been addressed.</p><p>Whether to disclose results indicating consanguinity is a question that may warrant special consideration, given varying norms about marriage within families. Clinicians will need to consider how disclosure affects the physician-patient relationship, the psychosocial impact on patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> any ethical or legal obligations for reporting that may exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It may be helpful to disclose results to families with a team that includes a geneticist, genetic counselor, and patient advocate to minimize the potential for distress and to ensure families understand the implications for disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. If either parent of a suspected consanguineous conception was a minor at the time of conception, a child-protection team should be consulted as necessary to understand legal obligations for reporting potential rape or sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The clinical relevance of a variant for the patient should always be interpreted in the context of the patient's personal medical history and family history of disease, as well as physical examination and other relevant information (eg, overall health, behavioral risks, reproductive issues). Some genomic findings may help to explain prior diagnoses of the patients or their relatives. In some cases, repeating the physical examination for subtle manifestations associated with disease may be appropriate.</p><p>The risk of disease is also influenced by the disease penetrance and expressivity, which varies by patient population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variants with well-established pathogenicity may have reduced penetrance (ie, an individual with such a variant may never develop disease) or variable expressivity (ie, differences in the severity of the phenotype or the specific disease manifestations that develop).

As a consequence, penetrance estimates for disease variants are overstated in some databases and publications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/4,27,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27,58,59</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H70178\" class=\"local\">'Underrepresented ethnicities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>An example of a decision matrix regarding which secondary findings should be disclosed is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97881 \">table 2</a>). This approach classifies variants into 'bins' based on their potential clinical utility to the patient, clinical validity (accuracy of predicting disease for that patient), and risks that disclosure may pose (eg, psychological distress, familial discord). It proposes routinely disclosing secondary findings of established utility and clear or presumed pathogenicity. Findings with clear validity but questionable utility to the patient could be disclosed depending on the potential harms of disclosure and patient preferences. Finally, findings without established validity and utility would be withheld altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The use of such a decision matrix may make genomic information less overwhelming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, such algorithms may be difficult to implement consistently, given that consensus about how to classify variants is often lacking and patient preferences may change over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98930240\"><span class=\"h2\">Disclose secondary findings to the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disclosure of secondary findings involves informing the patient that the findings are present, counseling regarding the clinical implications of the findings, and discussing whether any additional intervention is needed. Physicians who receive genomic reports must document whether and how they have acted upon the findings and their rationale, regardless of whether or not the patient has chosen to receive the information.</p><p>Importantly, detection of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant provides information about risk, not diagnosis of a disease, and the identification of a genetic variant is not a substitute for further diagnostic testing, if indicated. Conversely, &quot;negative reports from genomic testing may also require counseling to discuss the interpretation and further diagnostic steps. (See <a href=\"#H358243988\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H358244194\" class=\"local\">'Referrals'</a> below and <a href=\"#H70164\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of &quot;negative&quot; results'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, there are a variety of potential responses to a report of a secondary finding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More intensive screening may be indicated. As an example, colonoscopy screening for colon cancer may be initiated at an earlier age than recommended for the general population in a patient with a hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) gene variant associated with colon cancer predisposition. (See <a href=\"#H358243988\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic surgery may be considered. As an example, prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy may be performed in a woman with a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation who has completed childbearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carrier screening for a partner may be performed for a patient of reproductive age. As an example, if a patient has a recessive mutation for a disorder with a high carrier frequency in the population (eg, sickle cell disease in African Americans, cystic fibrosis in Caucasians, or Gaucher disease Type 1 in Ashkenazi Jews), the partner may be screened and results incorporated into preconception counseling discussions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient may undertake lifestyle modification for risk reduction. As an example, a patient with a gene variant associated with increased risk for melanoma may have increased adherence to screening recommendations for skin cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling may be appropriate. Examples include addressing uncertainty about how to interpret a secondary finding and the impact of the variant on clinical management; assisting a patient in choosing among multiple options for which there is clinical equipoise; and helping a patient in planning discussions regarding the information with relatives who may share the genetic risk.</p><p/><p>One of the most challenging issues is the management of a patient with a known pathogenic variant for a potentially life-threatening disease (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> mutation and risk of breast or ovarian cancer) for which the most effective intervention is major surgery. Evidence to guide management may exist for patients with a personal or family history of the disease, but comparable evidence is lacking for unselected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Clinicians may need to make critical decisions about how to respond to such findings despite a lack of consensus about how to interpret them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H70143\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p>The amount of time required to review secondary findings will depend on the context that warranted genetic testing in the first place and the content of the report. When testing was initiated for diagnostic or treatment purposes, it may be appropriate to postpone disclosure of nonurgent findings until primary concerns have been addressed and the patient is better able to understand and react to the information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Importantly, the nature of secondary findings means that the physician disclosing the result may have little or no prior knowledge about condition. Physicians may need to allocate time to self-educate in preparation for disclosure of information.</p><p>A final consideration that providers will need to consider is whether patients will communicate information to other family members. Genetic services often provide patients with written materials to facilitate sharing information with others. Primary care physicians can encourage patients to communicate with family members by checking in with patients to see how the information is flowing through the family and identifying possible barriers to communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In some cases, patients may designate family members to receive their genomic information upon their death.

It reliably detects single nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions, but can be less reliable for detecting moderate-sized insertions or deletions.

Based on epidemiological data from three large-scale genome sequencing projects in the United States that included more diverse samples (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI] Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, Human Genome Diversity Project), the investigators identified five variants that are almost certainly benign based on their high population frequency (ie, present in &gt;1 percent of the population).

(See <a href=\"#H70129\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and classification of variants'</a> above.)</p><p>Critics note that ACMG's stance conflicts with previous recommendations against testing children for adult-onset conditions, and that the recommendations undermine a child's right to decide whether to learn, in adulthood, whether they have inherited a particular genetic risk variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/53,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55</a>]. However, without a phenotype or family history suggestive of a disease, the patient's risk would not otherwise have come to clinical attention. In contrast to predictive genetic testing for a known familial risk, a genomic testing report may be the only chance for the patient and relatives to learn of their at-risk status, a scenario that ACMG categorizes as &quot;opportunistic screening.&quot; This scenario presents a different calculus than those in which a patient is aware of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> at-risk status due to a family history of the disease, and can choose in adulthood to pursue genetic testing for that condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,9,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,48</a>].</p><p>A position statement of the American Society for Human Genetics (ASHG) released in 2015 emphasized that disclosing actionable secondary findings from sequencing in a child has significant potential benefits for the child and parents. The ASHG statement supported an opt-out option for parents to decline analysis of their child's genome for secondary findings. However, it also recommended that clinicians should inform parents when genomic findings have &quot;urgent and serious implications for a child's health or welfare, and effective action can be taken to mitigate that threat,&quot; regardless of the parents' stated preferences for return of the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Proponents note that a secondary finding discovered in a child who undergoes genome sequencing for another clinical indication may reveal a risk with immediate medical relevance to one of the child's parents (eg, a mutation in the <em>BRCA1</em> gene). For families without a known family history of the disease, the parent may be unaware of the increased risk. Early knowledge of and screening for a known genetic risk could improve the parent's prognosis and even save his or her life, which could indirectly benefit a child. For parents in their childbearing years, risk information about devastating childhood onset conditions could also be useful for reproductive planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/6,9,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593204\"><span class=\"h2\">Research subjects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals undergo genetic testing as part of a research study that may be unrelated to their personal or family health care. Further, this testing is often performed in a research laboratory rather than a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory, and thus may not have the accompanying analytic validity provided by clinical testing. These differences raise additional ethical issues for the research subject. Obligations for disclosure are unclear, with some noting that researchers are obligated to disclose actionable, high-impact secondary findings from any stage of research, and others preferring disclosure only in limited circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-findings-from-genetic-testing/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>].

In general, researchers should consider the same principles for responding to secondary findings from genomic research as is used for clinical genomic testing.

Their detection is expected to increase with the expanded use of whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing. (See <a href=\"#H70129\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and classification of variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of detecting secondary findings depends on the type of genetic testing performed and the criteria used for identification and reporting. Actionable findings (ie, findings that might lead to a change in medical management) have been found in approximately 1 to 5 percent of individuals participating in genome sequencing studies. (See <a href=\"#H70136\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of detecting a secondary finding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing genomic testing should be informed about the potential for receiving information about secondary findings, including what kinds of genetic variants would be disclosed and how they would be communicated; this should occur as part of the consent process before genetic testing is initiated. Patients should also be provided an option to forego analysis of their genome for secondary findings (ie, an &quot;opt out&quot; option). The informed consent process may also involve a discussion of what to do with secondary findings after the patient's death, which may help patients initiate discussions with relatives about whether they would want to receive postmortem disclosure of this information, along with any other medical information that might be critical to their interpretation. In general, the negative impact of disclosing secondary findings appears to be relatively low. (See <a href=\"#H70143\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H358243956\" class=\"local\">'Postmortem disclosure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each laboratory performing genomic testing makes decisions regarding which genes will be analyzed for secondary findings, what risk assessment to assign to each variant within the gene, and which results are reported to the clinician. ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics) has identified a list of 59 genes associated with 27 conditions that it considers a minimal set for which known or likely pathogenic variants should be reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97842 \">table 1</a>). Numerous commissions have called for the refinement of professional standards for identifying and responding to secondary findings from genomic testing. (See <a href=\"#H358242275\" class=\"local\">'Decisions made by the laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision about whether and when to disclose secondary findings will depend on the clinical context and the judgment of clinicians involved in the patient's care. These findings should always be interpreted in the context of the patient's medical and family histories of disease, physical examination, and other relevant information. Ethical obligations to respect patients' autonomy and right not to receive information must be weighed against fiduciary duties to inform patients of potentially life-saving results. A potential decision matrix regarding which secondary findings should be disclosed is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97881 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1593125\" class=\"local\">'Review patient report'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disclosure of secondary findings from genomic testing involves informing the patient that the findings are present, counseling regarding the clinical implications of the result, and discussing whether any additional intervention is needed. Importantly, the presence of a pathogenic variant is a marker of increased risk, <strong>not</strong> a diagnosis of disease. Conversely, a &quot;negative&quot; result from a genomic testing report does not imply that the patient is not at increased risk of developing disease(s). (See <a href=\"#H98930240\" class=\"local\">'Disclose secondary findings to the patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H70164\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of &quot;negative&quot; results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical limitations apply to identification and interpretation of secondary in individuals of underrepresented ethnicities for whom data on disease prevalence and penetrance are lacking.
