It can be caused by problems with the lungs or with the heart, or by a low blood count, but its specific cause can sometimes take a while to pinpoint. Luckily, most causes of shortness of breath can be treated quickly once the cause is identified.</p><p>Many cases of shortness of breath are caused by simple, short lived problems, such as respiratory tract infections or allergies. The medical term for shortness of breath is dyspnea.</p><p>This article will discuss the main causes of shortness of breath and tests that might be used. More information about shortness of breath is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF SHORTNESS OF BREATH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute shortness of breath, which comes on suddenly, over the course of minutes or hours, usually has different causes than chronic shortness of breath, which develops over weeks or months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute shortness of breath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute shortness of breath usually happens along with other symptoms. The most common causes of acute shortness of breath include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia. These infections usually cause other symptoms, such as fever, cough, or coughing up sputum or mucus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which usually also causes itching, swelling, a rash, or other symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma, which often causes wheezing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blockage in the respiratory tract, which could happen after accidentally inhaling a foreign object, such as a peanut or partially chewed meat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood clot or other blockage in an artery in the lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-embolism-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A collapsed lung (pneumothorax). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interruptions in blood flow to the heart muscle, which might happen during a heart attack. When this is the cause of shortness of breath, there are often other symptoms, such as pain or pressure in the chest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure, a condition that affects the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy changes a woman's circulatory and respiratory systems, even before the woman is visibly pregnant. This type of shortness of breath is a normal change that happens during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic shortness of breath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the same things that cause acute shortness of breath can also cause chronic shortness of breath. For example, asthma symptoms can come and go over months or years. Heart failure can also continue to cause shortness of breath over months or years.</p><p>The most common causes of chronic shortness of breath include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition that often affects current or former smokers, includes conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial lung disease, a collection of lung disorders that involve damage or scarring of lung tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that leads to changes in the heart's shape and size, and ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deconditioning, the technical term for being out of shape. For example, if you do not exercise regularly, you may develop shortness of breath when climbing stairs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity can cause shortness of breath as extra weight in the chest and abdomen increases the work the muscles that control breathing must do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORTNESS OF BREATH SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People describe shortness of breath in different ways. Some people say they feel &quot;hungry for air,&quot; others say they feel as though they &quot;cannot breathe deeply enough&quot; and some feel a sense of chest tightness that impairs breathing. When you experience shortness of breath, you should pay attention to the sensations you feel and try to be as specific as possible when describing these sensations to your healthcare provider. If your shortness of breath varies with position, for example it comes on when you lie flat, this may be a clue to certain types of problems like the build-up of fluid in the lungs.</p><p>These descriptions hold important clues about the possible cause of the problem. Here is a questionnaire your healthcare provider may ask you to complete to get a better sense of your symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57712 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you develop shortness of breath, particularly if it occurs or persists while at rest or is significantly worse than what you ordinarily experience (eg, it is provoked by less activity than usual), you should see a healthcare provider. If you have severe shortness of breath or also have chest pain or nausea, go to the closest emergency room. Shortness of breath is not a symptom to ignore.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORTNESS OF BREATH DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider can learn a lot about your condition by listening to your description of the problem, and by asking about any other symptoms you may have. He or she can also learn a lot by listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and by checking your legs for swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider may also order one or more of the following tests to help diagnose the problem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test called a hematocrit can check for anemia, a condition that affects the blood's ability to carry oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test called a BNP can indicate if you have fluid buildup in your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest x-ray to look for pneumonia, or lung inflammation or scarring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An EKG is a test of your heart muscle that looks for signs of a heart attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called spirometry to measure the amount of air your lungs can hold and how effectively your lungs can empty and fill with air. This test can also indicate if you have asthma or emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called oximetry to measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORTNESS OF BREATH TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment for your shortness of breath will depend a lot on what is causing it. Shortness of breath caused by asthma, for example, will need one type of treatment, whereas shortness of breath caused by heart failure will need quite another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4648\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
