As an example, an observational study found that recurrence of major depression occurred in 74 percent of patients who remitted from an episode of unipolar psychotic depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-with-psychotic-features-maintenance-treatment-and-course-of-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there is little high quality evidence to guide decisions about maintenance treatment. </p><p>Pharmacotherapy is generally used for maintenance treatment of unipolar psychotic depression. Acutely ill patients who remit with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic are usually maintained on the same combination at the same dose for at least four months (at which point it may be feasible to discontinue the antipsychotic while maintaining the antidepressant). However, it may be necessary to lower doses or switch the antidepressant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the antipsychotic because of side effects (eg, weight gain due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>).

The combination is started the day after ECT is completed, unless the patient is suffering cognitive impairment secondary to ECT, in which case maintenance pharmacotherapy is delayed until the impairment has dissipated.

Maintenance ECT is discussed separately.

Most authorities discontinue the antipsychotic after four months of sustained recovery from the episode of unipolar psychotic depression, and continue the antidepressant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-with-psychotic-features-maintenance-treatment-and-course-of-illness/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. If the patient has side effects (eg, tardive dyskinesia with a first generation antipsychotic or weight gain with a second generation antipsychotic) and is clinically stable, it is reasonable to taper the antipsychotic sooner than four months. Conversely, for patients who relapsed while discontinuing the antipsychotic during maintenance treatment of prior episodes of psychotic depression, it is reasonable to maintain the antipsychotic for at least 6 to 12 months. </p><p>We suggest slowly tapering the antipsychotic over one month to increase the probability of detecting incipient depressive and psychotic symptoms before a full-blown episode of psychotic depression recurs. Each week we taper by approximately 25 percent of the dose used to achieve remission. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reduced each week by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. If symptoms recur during the taper, the dose is usually titrated back up to the full dose used initially to achieve remission. If a full-blown episode develops despite increasing the dose and does not improve within four to eight weeks, we suggest switching to an alternative antipsychotic.

The antipsychotic is generally tapered and discontinued after sustained recovery for four months, and the antidepressant is maintained for at least two years. Maintenance ECT is a reasonable option for patients who fail multiple courses of maintenance pharmacotherapy.

(See <a href=\"#H4936027\" class=\"local\">'Course of illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All-cause mortality may be significantly greater for unipolar psychotic depression than nonpsychotic depression. However, the rate of suicide deaths does not appear to differ between psychotic and nonpsychotic depression.
