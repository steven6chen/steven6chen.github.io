The primary hereditary neuropathies predominantly affect peripheral nerves and produce symptoms of peripheral nerve dysfunction.</p><p>Historically, the primary hereditary neuropathies were designated by eponyms that had the connotation of specific clinical features (eg, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [CMT] or Dejerine-Sottas disease). However, phenotypic variability resulted in substantial diagnostic confusion.</p><p>The Dyck classification developed in the 1970s helped to define specific types based upon clinical and electrophysiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many of the primary hereditary neuropathies were divided into hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN) and hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). However, the eponym Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has had a resurgence in popularity, and today the term &quot;CMT&quot; is regarded as being synonymous with HMSN.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">CMT/HMSN</span> is the focus of the current review and for the sake of simplicity will be referred to as CMT for the remainder of this review. This topic will review the genetics, clinical features, and evaluation of CMT. Management and prognosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The primary hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), the neuropathies not included in this classification, and the disorders affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary neuropathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) consists of a spectrum of disorders caused by mutations in various genes whose protein products are expressed in myelin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> axonal structures within peripheral nerves. A variety of mutation types have been associated with CMT, including whole gene duplications and deletions, as well as point mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For example, duplication of the <em>PMP22</em> gene causes CMT1A, the most common subtype (approximately 40 percent overall).</p><p>The association of different mutations within the same gene with various clinical phenotypes is a common finding in this group of peripheral neuropathies. This variability suggests that these disorders represent a spectrum of related phenotypes caused by an underlying defect in peripheral nervous system myelination and axonal function.</p><p>The major categories of CMT are CMT types 1 through 7 as well as an X-linked category, CMTX. Within each category, a specific disease associated with a particular gene is assigned a letter (eg, CMT1A, CMT1B, etc). CMT is genetically heterogeneous with more than 30 genes identified to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Despite this, the vast majority of cases are attributed to mutations in just four of these genes: <em>PMP22</em>, <em>MPZ</em>, <em>GJB1</em>, and <em>MFN2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The overall estimated prevalence of CMT is 40 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], which varies from 10 to 82 per 100,000 in different reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is no known ethnic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CMT types 1 and 2 represent by far the largest proportion of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The most common initial presentation of CMT is distal weakness and atrophy manifesting with foot drop and pes cavus. Sensory symptoms are often present but tend to be less prominent. Later in the course, foot deformities such as hammertoes ensue, along with hand weakness and atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72688 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation, despite the widespread availability of genetic testing, still centers on electromyography (EMG) in many cases. Genetic testing is key to confirming the diagnosis after EMG. However, it may be appropriate to skip EMG and go directly to genetic testing in a patient with a strong family history of confirmed CMT, especially when a relative has a known mutation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CMT1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMT1 is characterized by peripheral nerve demyelination and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. CMT1A, due to duplication of the <em>PMP22</em> gene, accounts for approximately 70 to 80 percent of CMT1 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Affected patients typically present in the first or early second decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Infants with this mutation may be symptomatic, but these cases are generally classified as congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy or Dejerine-Sottas disease (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'CMT3'</a> below).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early complaints may include frequent sprained ankles caused by distal muscle weakness or difficulty running and keeping up with peers. Physical findings may include areflexia, pes cavus, and distal lower extremity weakness and atrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal calf muscle atrophy often occurs, causing the classic &quot;stork leg deformity,&quot; which tends to become more prominent with disease progression. Walking is clumsy because of both muscle weakness and sensory loss. Sensory loss progresses gradually and may be detected on physical examination via loss of proprioception and vibration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late changes include atrophy of the intrinsic hand and foot muscles. Palpable enlargement of the peripheral nerves may occur secondary to nerve hypertrophy. In addition, kyphosis or scoliosis may develop at later stages of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulation may be significantly affected but complete loss of ambulation is uncommon. Life expectancy is normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease exacerbation can occur in pregnancy, an effect that may be mediated by increased plasma progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H781703\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Nerve conduction studies (NCS) show severe slowing of conduction velocity in both the motor and sensory nerves, typically with values less than 60 percent of normal. The pattern of slowing is generally uniform, with no conduction block or temporal dispersion. In some cases sensory responses may be absent. Nerve conduction velocity slowing is present even in asymptomatic infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Needle electromyography (EMG) examination is typically normal. Frequently, little correlation exists between the electromyographic and clinical findings, as the latter are probably produced primarily by secondary axonal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>].</p><p>Sural nerve biopsy shows demyelination that affects primarily the large nerve fibers. Onion bulbs are a characteristic feature; they reflect repeated demyelination and remyelination and represent redundant Schwann cells, collagen, and fibroblasts. Secondary axonal changes may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics of CMT1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMT1 is caused by mutations in genes that are expressed in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common types exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance and have been subdivided into types 1A, 1B, 1C, etc. However, autosomal recessive and X-linked forms also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'X-linked CMT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4307678\"><span class=\"h3\">CMT1A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMT1A is associated with a 1.5 Mb duplication or, less commonly, a point mutation of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (<em>PMP22</em>) gene on chromosome 17p11.2-p1; duplication leads to overexpression of <em>PMP22</em>, while point mutations alter distribution of the protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,21</a>]. Interestingly, patients with a 1.5 Mb deletion at this site develop hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with point mutations usually have more prominent clinical manifestations. In these patients, <em>PMP22</em> partially accumulates in the Schwann cells rather than being inserted in the myelin sheath, as occurs with gene duplication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In addition to the typical findings discussed above, patients with CMT1A may have associated sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In one report, 13 asymptomatic family members of an index patient with CMT and sleep apnea were investigated for these disorders. Eleven of the 14 (including the index patient) had <em>PMP22</em> duplications on chromosome 17; all 11 also had sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3895527630\"><span class=\"h3\">Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP, tomaculous neuropathy), a recurrent, episodic demyelinating neuropathy, is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with <em>PMP22</em> deletions and point mutations that is allelic to CMT1A. Affected patients typically present with isolated nerve palsies in areas frequently affected by compression or mild trauma. Symptoms first appear in the second decade in most patients, but they can occur in younger children or be delayed until into the third decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Single nerve palsies typically appear sequentially, resolving in days to months, and may be associated with persistent motor deficits in various nerve distributions.</p><p>The most frequently affected nerves are those at common sites of trauma or entrapment and include the axillary, median, radial, ulnar, and peroneal nerves, along with the brachial plexus. Other findings may include cranial nerve involvement, sensorineural deafness, and scoliosis. In one series of 70 patients, nerve involvement in episodes of palsy occurred with the following frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peroneal nerve &ndash; 36 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulnar nerve &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brachial plexus &ndash; 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial nerve &ndash; 13 percent</p><p/><p>Atypical phenotypes of HNPP include a polyneuropathy resembling chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and presentations involving generalized weakness and muscle cramps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], musculoskeletal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], or low back pain with radicular symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Central nervous system white matter lesions have been reported in isolated patients, as well as several members of a large family with HNPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>HNPP results in focal slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy shows focal myelin thickening (tomacula) on light microscopy. These lesions are best seen with teased fiber preparations and appear as enlarged sausage-shaped thickenings of the myelin sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>HNPP is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with <em>PMP22</em> gene mutations. In approximately 80 percent of HNPP cases, there is a 1.5 Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 that results in reduced expression of <em>PMP22</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34-36</a>]. The deletion corresponds to the duplicated region of <em>PMP22</em> present in CMT1A. Approximately 20 percent of patients with HNPP have point mutations or small deletions in <em>PMP22</em>, and sporadic cases with de novo deletions have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,36-38</a>]. <em>PMP22</em> mutations may slow nerve conduction by disrupting myelin junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one report of seven children with <em>PMP22</em> deletions and early-onset HNPP, a coexisting Ile92Val polymorphism in the <em>LITAF</em> gene was present in six children, suggesting that this polymorphism leads to an early-onset HNPP phenotype when accompanied by a <em>PMP22</em> deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>On electrodiagnostic testing, patients with HNPP will typically display signs of a demyelinating neuropathy even while asymptomatic, including subclinical carpal tunnel syndrome. There should be multiple signs of demyelination if enough nerves are studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Depending on the clinical presentation, it may make sense to perform these studies prior to sending out genetic testing.</p><p>The treatment of HNPP is conservative, and primarily consists of strategies to avoid mild trauma and compression at vulnerable sites. This may entail special accommodations at school or work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4307685\"><span class=\"h3\">CMT1B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMT1B, originally known as peroneal muscular atrophy, is most often caused by point mutations in the myelin protein zero (<em>MPZ</em>) gene on chromosome 1q22, which cause overexpression of the major myelin structural protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. <em>MPZ</em> is one of the four genes that cause the vast majority of cases of CMT.

Transgenic mice containing extra copies of the <em>MPZ </em>gene manifest a dose-dependent, dysmyelinating neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In six individuals with CMT1 from one family, comparative genome hybridization analysis revealed an increased gene dosage, estimated to be five copies, of the entire <em>MPZ</em> gene and flanking genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Mutations of <em>MPZ</em> gene introns that disrupt normal protein splicing have also been identified in a small number of families with CMT1B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Myelin protein-zero is normally expressed on the cell membrane of Schwann cells, and plays a major role in myelin membrane adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

The clustering of mutations associated with CMT1C suggests that a domain of <em>LITAF</em> may be important in peripheral nerve function. In contrast to other known genes that cause CMT1, the level of expression of the <em>LITAF </em>transcript did not change during development or in response to lung injury, suggesting a potential new mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation resulting in demyelinating neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMT1D is caused by mutations in the early growth response 2 (<em>EGR2</em>) gene on chromosome 10q21.1-q22.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMT1E is characterized by a classic CMT phenotype and sensorineural hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In a patient with a family history of confirmed CMT, bypassing electrodiagnostic testing in favor of immediate genetic testing may be appropriate, especially when a relative has a known mutation. However, inheritance patterns can be obscured because of the highly variable expression of CMT, such that oligosymptomatic relatives may escape detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/195\" class=\"abstract_t\">195</a>].

When performed by trained and experienced neurophysiologists, EMG is an efficient and highly informative diagnostic study that can confirm or disprove the presence of a polyneuropathy compatible with the diagnosis of CMT and determine the likely physiology of the neuropathy. For most patients with no family history of CMT, it is important to perform EMG prior to genetic testing, as the absence of a neuropathy would indicate that genetic testing for CMT is unnecessary, while the physiology of a neuropathy detected on EMG will help guide the interpretation of subsequent genetic testing.</p><p>In some situations, immediate genetic testing (rather than EMG) may be warranted, such as when the patient has an affected family member who already has a known CMT mutation or if CMT1A seems likely based upon the clinical features or family history. CMT1A is the most common type of CMT, and the genetic test is very simple and quick.</p><p>An EMG test typically involves two components, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and the needle EMG study; the latter is also referred to as the needle examination. The NCS portion of the test can detect signs of demyelination (via slow conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, prolonged F response latencies, conduction block, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal dispersion) and axonal loss (via low amplitude nerve potentials). However, low amplitude nerve potentials may be compatible with several different types of neuromuscular disease. Thus, these findings if present must be correlated with neurogenic abnormalities on the needle EMG examination to confirm the presence of an axonal neuropathy. In some cases there will be features of both demyelination and axonal loss, which has been described in certain subtypes of CMT. In others, the EMG may be normal, indicating that CMT is not present, or may be abnormal, indicating that the disease process is not CMT but something entirely different, such as a myopathy or disorder of the neuromuscular junction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4005287849\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing and counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is a key component of the diagnostic evaluation for CMT and is necessary for the confirmation of subtype-specific diagnoses.</p><p>Genetic counseling should be made available to all patients and families with a suspected hereditary neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This study examined 787 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CMT between 1997 and 2009, among whom specific genetic mutations were identified in 67 percent. The most commonly identified CMT subtypes were CMT1A (<em>PMP22</em> duplication), CMTX1 (<em>GJB1</em> mutation), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (<em>PMP22</em> deletion), CMT1B (<em>MPZ</em> mutation), and CMT2A (<em>MFN2</em> mutation). Together, these five subtypes accounted for 92 percent of genetically defined CMT cases. All other CMT subtypes and associated mutations each accounted for &lt;1 percent of genetically defined CMT.</p><p>The take-home point of this study from the Sanger sequencing era was that genetic testing in most cases should focus only on <em>PMP22</em>, <em>MPZ</em>, <em>GJB1</em>, and <em>MFN2</em>, since these four genes were responsible for the vast majority of CMT cases. This prioritization of genes to be tested has become somewhat less relevant since 2011, as next generation sequencing (NGS) test panels have reduced the cost dramatically.</p><p>In the era before NGS panels became widely available, broad genetic test panels based on the older Sanger sequencing technology were prohibitively expensive and included a large number of genes that were each associated with &lt;1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/198\" class=\"abstract_t\">198</a>]. With the advent of NGS, it is now only marginally more expensive to test 50 genes as it is to test 5 on one of these panels. However, both EMG and knowledge regarding the distribution of mutations remain important for the interpretation of genetic test results. The dreaded variant of unknown significance appears in NGS reports as often, if not more often, than in the old Sanger sequencing panels, and the ability to provide a clinical interpretation for such genetic test reports is a critical skill among physicians that is not adequately appreciated. The most common mutation of all, the <em>PMP22</em> duplication, is not detected reliably by NGS technology, and thus it is important to know exactly what types of mutations will be identified with any genetic test that is ordered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554514096\"><span class=\"h3\">Focused genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have used an algorithmic strategy of focused genetic testing for CMT directed by age at onset, electrodiagnostic findings, and inheritance pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Electrophysiologic studies show a distinctive sensorimotor neuropathy pattern that can help to establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,199\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,199</a>]. A generalized sensory neuropathy with slowed conduction velocity and prolongation of distal motor latencies occurs, the latter often including findings suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome. Motor conduction velocity is slowed only mildly, and F-wave latencies are prolonged. These changes are indicative of disproportionate slowing of distal nerve conduction. A superimposed but independent entrapment neuropathy with focal slowing at sites of compression with acute weakness also occurs.

Symptom onset varies from infancy to middle age. Initial clinical features typically include deteriorating vision due to retinitis pigmentosa and anosmia. Sensorineural hearing loss, ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, ichthyosis, and cardiac conduction defects develop later. The neuropathy resembles demyelinating CMT due to the presence of pes cavus, progressive course, and demyelinating features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/195\" class=\"abstract_t\">195</a>]; nerve conduction studies often show a slowed conduction velocity.

The late infantile form of MLD presents from age six months to two years; early signs include regression of motor skills, gait difficulty, ataxia, hypotonia, extensor plantar responses, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. The juvenile form of MLD presents between 3 and 16 years of age with gait disturbance, intellectual impairment, ataxia, upper motor neuron signs, and a peripheral neuropathy. Seizures may occur.

The major feature of these conditions is loss of large myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. HSAN type I, the most common form, is characterized by degeneration of dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons, leading to distal sensory loss and later distal muscle wasting and weakness and variable neural deafness. Bone necrosis and spontaneous distal amputation can occur. Symptoms often begin in early childhood but may be delayed until the third decade.

CIDP is a disorder of peripheral nerves and nerve roots with a number of variants. Both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants. The classic form of CIDP is fairly symmetric and motor involvement is greater than sensory. Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients have globally diminished or absent reflexes. The course may be progressive or relapsing-remitting. In some cases, CIDP may mimic CMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/195\" class=\"abstract_t\">195</a>]. Nerve conduction studies in CIDP typically show non-uniform, non-homogeneous slowing with partial or complete conduction blocks. This finding can help differentiate CIDP from CMT, since nerve conduction slowing in the demyelinating forms of CMT is typically diffuse and homogeneous.

Major subcategories one through seven are recognized and include at least 30 different disorders. Types 1 and 2, along with the primary X-linked form, are the most frequent. Common features include both motor and sensory nerve manifestations with distal leg weakness, foot deformities (pes cavus, hammer toes), and sensory deficits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72688 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMT1 is a demyelinating disorder of peripheral nerves. It has been subdivided on the basis of genetic markers into several subtypes, of which CMT1A and CMT1B are the most common. However, the clinical manifestations are similar. Affected patients typically present in the first or early second decade, but infants may be symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'CMT1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early complaints may include frequent sprained ankles caused by distal muscle weakness or difficulty running. Early physical findings include loss of reflexes, pes cavus foot deformity, and hammer toes. Distal calf muscle atrophy often occurs. Walking is clumsy because of both muscle weakness and sensory loss. Sensory loss is gradual and mainly involves proprioception and vibration. Later changes include atrophy of the intrinsic hand and foot muscles. Palpable enlargement of the peripheral nerves may occur. In addition, kyphosis or scoliosis often develops. Ambulation is variable but usually is maintained through life. Life expectancy is not affected. Disease exacerbation can occur in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'CMT1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nerve conduction studies show significant slowing of conduction velocity in both the motor and sensory nerves. Sural nerve biopsy shows demyelination that affects primarily the large nerve fibers. Onion bulbs are a characteristic feature; they reflect repeated cycles of demyelination and remyelination. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'CMT1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common type of CMT1, CMT1A, is caused by a duplication of the <em>PMP22</em> gene, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of CMT1 cases. CMT1 can also be caused by point mutations in genes (particularly <em>PMP22</em> and <em>MPZ</em>, but also <em>LITAF</em>, <em>ERG2</em>, and <em>NEFL</em>) that are expressed in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP), a recurrent, episodic demyelinating neuropathy, is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with <em>PMP22</em> deletions and point mutations that is allelic to CMT1A. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetics of CMT1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMT2, also called axonal CMT, is a more heterogeneous disorder than CMT1. It is characterized by normal or mildly reduced nerve conduction velocities with decreased amplitude and axonal degenerative loss without hypertrophic features; demyelination does not occur or is minimal. The classic features of CMT2 include distal weakness, atrophy, sensory loss, decreased deep tendon reflexes and variable foot deformity. The onset of symptoms usually is in the second or third decade of life. Sensory symptoms, with loss of vibration and proprioception, typically predominate over motor symptoms. Distal trophic ulcerations in the feet may occur. An early-onset form of CMT2 becomes clinically apparent before age five years. Possible late-onset forms of CMT2 have also been described. The genetic basis of CMT2 is heterogeneous, though <em>MFN2</em> gene mutations appear to be the most common cause of the CMT2 phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'CMT2'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genetics of CMT2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMTX1 caused by mutations in <em>GJB1</em> is the second most common form of CMT after CMT1A, accounting for 7 to 12 percent of all CMT cases. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'X-linked CMT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate CMT is an uncommon CMT variant that is characterized by intermediate nerve conduction velocities and both axonal and demyelinating features on histology. Thus, it is considered an &quot;intermediate&quot; phenotype between CMT1 (primarily demyelinating) and CMT2 (primarily axonal). (See <a href=\"#H877051877\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate CMT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, classified as CMT3, are severe, early-onset peripheral neuropathies. Historically considered to be distinct clinical and genetic entities, they are now recognized to have considerable genetic overlap with each other and with other forms of CMT. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'CMT3'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMT4 is a heterogeneous group of rare autosomal recessive demyelinating motor sensory neuropathies. These recessive forms of CMT are clinically more severe and less likely to result from mutations in structural myelin proteins than the autosomal dominant forms. Individuals with CMT4 have a typical CMT phenotype of distal muscle weakness and atrophy associated with sensory loss and foot deformities (eg, pes cavus). Nerve conduction velocities are usually slow (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s)</span>. Several subtypes of CMT4 disease are described based upon genetic, electrophysiologic, and pathologic criteria. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'CMT4'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive history and physical examination remain the core of ascertainment of and evaluation for cases of CMT. Genetic testing is key to confirming the diagnosis after electrodiagnostic testing.
