An overview of the evaluation and management is included (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61711 \">table 1</a>). Iron deficiency, iron requirements, and iron balance are discussed separately.

The overall number of exposures in this age group decreasing. In addition, the number of major effects and death in children are improved when compared to the period from 1990 to 2000. </p><p>The epidemiology varies significantly by the type of ingestion: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unintentional ingestion</strong> &mdash; The vast majority of childhood iron poisonings are unintentional and result in no or minimal toxicity. The most serious exposures involve prenatal vitamins and pure iron preparations that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> tablets, which typically have significantly more elemental iron per tablet (60 to 65 mg) than other iron preparations. These tablets appeal to children because they are often brightly colored, sugar-coated, and have the appearance of candy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In one population-based case-control study, the birth of a sibling within six months was identified as a risk factor for iron poisoning in children younger than three years of age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI 0.9-3.9); the risk was greatest within the first postpartum month (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 0.8-16.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children's chewable vitamins with iron are less likely than adult preparations to cause serious toxicity. There were no fatalities among 195,780 exposures to chewable children's vitamins with iron reported by the American Association of Poison Control Centers between 1983 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. During the same time period, there were 60 deaths among 147,079 ingestions of adult preparations containing iron. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Home management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the majority of patients treated for iron ingestion in healthcare facilities experience some toxicity, there has been a reduction in the number of fatalities from unintentional exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This reduced fatality rate has been attributed to the implementation of preventive measures, particularly unit dose packaging, which followed several highly publicized deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. These regulations were unfortunately withdrawn in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-poisoning-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of poisoning in children&quot;, section on 'Primary prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As with most unintentional ingestions, the best therapy is prevention. Child-resistant closures are required on vitamin bottles that contain more than 250 mg of elemental iron. Nevertheless, some intoxications involve packages or containers that are left open, improperly closed, or opened by a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. All medications should be kept in a safe place and stored in their original packaging or in child-resistant containers. Caregivers of children should be instructed to call their regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222) in the event of ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intentional ingestion</strong> &mdash; The epidemiology of intentional iron overdose differs from that of unintentional ingestion. In one institutional review of 113 cases of iron overdose requiring hospital admission, 58 percent were determined to be intentional (based upon information provided by the patient, family, or friends) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among the intentional ingestions, 80 percent occurred among females, with a mean age of 19.8 years. The mortality rate is increased among patients with intentional ingestion (10 percent in this series versus less than 1 percent for unintentional iron ingestions).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron preparations are available most commonly in the form of iron salts. The amount of elemental iron in each preparation varies depending upon the salt form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ferrous gluconate</a> (12 percent elemental iron) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ferrous sulfate</a> (20 percent elemental iron)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ferrous fumarate</a> (33 percent elemental iron)</p><p/><p>Time-release formulations or enteric-coated iron preparations are available and may have delayed absorption. This is an important consideration when interpreting serum iron concentration. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Serum iron concentration'</a> below.)</p><p>Iron is an ingredient in many multiple-vitamin preparations. Prenatal vitamins typically contain 60 to 65 mg of elemental iron, whereas most multivitamin preparations contain 15 to 18 mg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73372 \">table 3</a>). The &quot;placebo&quot; row of some 28-day oral contraceptive pill packages may contain iron and are another potential source for accidental ingestion (eg, the placebo row of Loestrin Fe and Estrostep Fe each contain 75 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous fumarate</a> [25 mg elemental iron]).</p><p>Nonionic forms of iron include carbonyl iron and iron polysaccharide complex. Carbonyl iron is produced by vaporizing submicroscopic spheres of uncharged, highly purified metallic iron (Fe&ordm;). Fe&ordm; must be converted to Fe2+ by gastric acid before it can be absorbed. As a result, carbonyl iron is absorbed more slowly and has a higher bioavailability than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a>. In addition, it has a greater safety margin than ferrous sulfate. There have been no published reports of serious or fatal poisoning from ingestion of carbonyl iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Iron polysaccharide complex is produced by the neutralization of ferric chloride-carbohydrate solution. It contains 46 percent elemental iron by weight and appears to be less toxic than ferrous salts. In one large retrospective series of iron polysaccharide complex overdose, there were no major effects or deaths reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The toxicity of iron depends upon the amount of elemental iron ingested. Various salt forms contain different percentages of elemental iron (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73372 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Iron preparations'</a> above.) As an example, a 15 kg child who ingests 10 tablets containing 325 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> each has ingested about 43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental iron.</p><p>The minimum toxic dose and the lethal doses of iron are not firmly established. The following symptoms and toxicities have been reported at various doses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who ingest less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental iron are usually asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestions of 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> may or may not produce symptoms of serious toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small number of patients who have taken 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of iron are symptomatic. In one retrospective review of 199 acute iron exposures, none of the patients who ingested between 40 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of iron developed serious toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestions of more than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can be associated with serious toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/2,12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death from iron toxicity has been reported from a wide range of doses (from 60 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ferric iron is toxic to a number of cellular processes. The primary mechanism for iron-induced tissue damage is free radical production and lipid peroxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Toxic effects on cells include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/12,16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucosal cell necrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of capillary permeability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alteration of the lipid membrane of mitochondria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of enzymatic processes in the Krebs cycle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct vasodilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of serum proteases (eg, thrombin)</p><p/><p>Normally, transferrin (the chief iron binding protein in plasma) and ferritin (an iron storage protein that sequesters iron intracellularly) protect cells by binding iron, limiting the amount that is circulating in the ferric state. However, these protective mechanisms become quickly overwhelmed with an acute intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Local toxicity (manifested as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding) develops from iron-induced damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Systemic toxicity occurs as the result of injury to the cardiovascular system and liver. The cause of death from iron poisoning is usually shock or liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Kinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron is absorbed primarily in the duodenum and upper jejunum. It crosses cell membranes only in the ferrous state (Fe2+). Once absorbed by the mucosal cells, iron is oxidized to the ferric (Fe3+) form. From the enterocyte, iron is released into the plasma and bound to transferrin.</p><p>After therapeutic dosing, 10 to 35 percent of iron is absorbed. As much as 80 to 95 percent may be absorbed in iron-deficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. The absorption of enteric-coated preparations is less than that of nonenteric-coated preparations.</p><p>The amount of iron that is absorbed in an overdose situation is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Physiologic regulation of iron absorption is lost in the setting of excessive iron ingestions. In addition, normal protective mechanisms (transport and storage proteins) become saturated, resulting in more free circulating iron (which is responsible for cellular toxicity).</p><p>Peak serum iron concentrations (SICs) occur two to three hours after therapeutic dosing and four to six hours after ingestion of an overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Absorbed iron is rapidly cleared from the circulation and taken up by the cells of various tissues, where high concentrations of iron disrupt mitochondrial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. For the most part, entry of iron into the tissues is an active, saturable process; the liver is unique in that it also can passively absorb iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Because of the liver's capacity to absorb considerable quantities of iron, the half-life of iron after therapeutic and toxic dosing is similar (approximately six hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There are no physiologic mechanisms for iron excretion. Iron may be lost via the constant sloughing of intestinal cells, as well as menstrual bleeding in menarchal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manifestations of iron toxicity are typically described in five (often overlapping) phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal (GI) phase: 30 minutes to 6 hours after ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latent, or relative stability, phase: 6 to 24 hours after ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock and metabolic acidosis: 6 to 72 hours after ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Hepatotoxicity/hepatic</span> necrosis: 12 to 96 hours after ingestion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel obstruction: 2 to 8 weeks after ingestion</p><p/><p>The progression of these phases may occur rapidly depending on the severity of the ingestion. The clinical phase should therefore be determined by the patient's clinical and laboratory manifestations, not by the time since the ingestion. Each phase is described in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastrointestinal (GI) phase occurs between 30 minutes and 6 hours after ingestion. The clinical manifestations of this phase are the result of direct injury to the GI mucosa. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, lethargy, shock (from capillary leak and third spacing), and metabolic acidosis. Vomitus and stools may be dark gray, green or black due to the presence of disintegrating iron tablets. Vomiting is the most sensitive indicator of serious ingestions. Death in this phase is usually caused by hypovolemic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Most patients with mild to moderate iron toxicity do not progress beyond this phase and their symptoms may actually resolve within four to six hours. If no gastrointestinal symptoms develop within six hours of a presumed iron ingestion, it is unlikely that iron toxicity will occur. Ingestion of enteric-coated iron tablets is an exception to the &quot;six hour rule&quot;.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Latent phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The latent phase (sometimes also referred to as the &quot;relative stability&quot; or &quot;quiescent phase&quot;) occurs from 6 to 24 hours after ingestion and is a period of apparent recovery. The resolution of GI symptoms is presumed to occur as circulating free iron is redistributed into the reticuloendothelial systems.</p><p>This phase may be transient or may not appear at all in patients with severe iron poisoning. Patients appear stable, but they may not be asymptomatic. Careful evaluation may reveal poor perfusion, hyperventilation (secondary to metabolic acidosis), and oliguria (secondary to hypovolemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>It is critical to differentiate patients who are in this phase from those with low toxicity ingestions who have exhibited only mild gastrointestinal symptoms and for whom toxicity has now resolved. Patients whose GI symptoms have improved should be observed and reevaluated to determine whether they have truly recovered or are progressing to further clinical deterioration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Shock and metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular toxicity (manifested as shock, pallor, tachycardia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension) may develop. Coagulopathy (preceding liver dysfunction) can occur because of iron's effect (as a protease inhibitor) on prothrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The etiology of the shock state may be hypovolemic, distributive, or cardiogenic, depending on the time of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypovolemic shock, due to fluid and blood losses, occurs within the first few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distributive shock develops a few hours later. The etiology is poorly understood. Decreased vascular tone and increased vascular permeability may be caused primarily by iron or possibly ferritin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiogenic shock develops within 24 to 48 hours after the ingestion due to the depressant effect of iron on myocardial cells.</p><p/><p>Metabolic acidosis is often profound and is an indicator of iron-induced toxicity. It is caused, at least in part, by hydration of absorbed ferric ions, which releases three protons (Fe3<sup>+</sup> + 3H2O &mdash;&gt; Fe(OH)<sup>3</sup> + 3H<sup>+</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lactic acidosis may also occur as the result of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypovolemia/poor</span> tissue perfusion and iron-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>The following clinical features, leading to multisystem organ failure, can be seen in the shock and metabolic acidosis phase:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with hematemesis and melena, may recur. Bowel perforation may develop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive pulmonary dysfunction (acute lung injury or the acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a distinguishing characteristic of this phase. The etiology likely includes free radical production causing capillary leak, along with hypotension and metabolic acidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An iron-induced coagulopathy may worsen bleeding and hypovolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal and neurologic dysfunction can develop during this phase.</p><p/><p>Patients may develop jaundice, coma, and worsening coagulopathy from hepatic dysfunction. Death in this third phase is caused by widespread cellular dysfunction, which results from mitochondrial disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Once a critical amount of iron has reached the mitochondria, therapy has little effect and outcome is poor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatotoxicity/hepatic necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of hepatotoxicity is usually within two days of ingestion. Although hepatic necrosis does not occur in all iron-poisoned patients, it may develop within 12 to 96 hours after ingestion. The liver is particularly vulnerable to iron toxicity for several reasons. It is exposed to high concentrations of iron through the portal circulation, it absorbs iron passively, and hepatocytes have high metabolic activity. Liver failure is the second most common cause of death from iron poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel obstruction occurs as the result of GI scarring. Symptoms typically develop two to eight weeks after the ingestion. The classic location for GI obstruction is the gastric outlet, since this is where iron tablets aggregate and damage tissue, with subsequent scar tissue formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. Vomiting is the presenting symptom of this late sequela.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other agents that can cause vomiting with toxic ingestion include salicylates, caustic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, isopropanol, arsenic and mercurial salts, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), organophosphorus compounds, nicotine carbamates, mushrooms, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron poisoning is primarily a clinical diagnosis. A combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory features can identify patients at risk for systemic toxicity. These may include signs or symptoms of a severe overdose (such as severe, persistent vomiting and diarrhea, hypovolemia, altered mental status, and unexplained metabolic acidosis) or more subtle indications of volume depletion and metabolic acidosis (such as tachycardia, lethargy, or tachypnea). All of these patients require aggressive supportive care and treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'GI decontamination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Deferoxamine'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Mildly symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have ingested nontoxic doses of elemental iron frequently experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Those with an unintentional overdose of less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> elemental iron and a normal physical examination may be observed.</p><p>SIC, an abdominal radiograph and, perhaps, an arterial or venous pH should be obtained when the amount of elemental iron that has been ingested cannot be determined or is more than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Patients with mild GI symptoms and SIC less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> have been managed successfully without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. We typically observe and monitor these patients for 6 to 12 hours prior to discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of asymptomatic patients who have ingested a potentially toxic dose of iron or an unknown dose depends upon the time of presentation, peak SIC, and findings on abdominal radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/3,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,40</a>].</p><p>Patients without symptoms for whom the amount of elemental iron ingested is either more than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or is unknown should have SIC measured and an abdominal radiograph performed. Management may then proceed as follows:</p><p>Patients who have a SIC less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and no radiopaque pills on abdominal radiograph should be observed for six hours. They may be discharged if they remain asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron overdose during pregnancy is common, but is unique among overdoses because the fetus is protected from the direct effects of iron. Transplacental iron absorption is a saturable process. Consequently, significant accumulation of fetal iron does not occur. The fetus is at risk only when the mother experiences clinical decompensation, such as hypotension, liver failure, or pulmonary failure. Pregnancy should not change the management of iron poisoning. Indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> therapy in pregnant patients are the same as those for other patients. Withholding deferoxamine when it is clinically indicated, out of a misguided notion that it may be toxic to the fetus, is a serious error that may have severe consequences for mother and fetus. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Deferoxamine'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Home management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any patient who may have ingested a toxic amount of iron must be referred to a hospital for evaluation and management. However, an evidence-based consensus guideline for the outpatient management of iron ingestion from the American Association of Poison Control Centers suggests that many children with unintentional ingestions of children's chewable vitamins with iron may be carefully observed at home with appropriate follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-iron-poisoning/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Children who develop persistent vomiting or diarrhea may need referral to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of dehydration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9897575\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls in management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several pitfalls in the management of acute iron poisoning have been identified.

In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses. The World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its website (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6498\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The toxicity of an iron ingestion is determined by the <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of elemental iron ingested and the type of iron formulation. Prenatal iron preparations have the potential for more serious toxicity than adult and child multivitamin preparations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73372\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73372 \">table 3</a>). Carbonyl iron and iron polysaccharide complex formulations have little to no toxicity when ingested in overdose. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Iron preparations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron exerts its toxic effect in the free ferric state through the creation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation that cause damage to cells. Protective mechanisms (such as binding to transferrin in the blood and to ferritin within cells) are quickly overwhelmed when there is an overdose. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of iron toxicity are typically described in five (often overlapping) phases that are manifestations of the toxic effects of iron. These phases include gastrointestinal (GI) features, a latent phase, shock and metabolic acidosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">hepatotoxicity/hepatic</span> necrosis, and bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of patients who have ingested iron should include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61711 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Determine the type of iron preparation if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Determine how much elemental iron was ingested and when.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Identify those who are severely ill or who have subtle features of a significant ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perform laboratory and radiologic evaluation for patients with systemic symptoms and for those with no or localized symptoms who have ingested greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or an unknown amount of elemental iron.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with any of the following indications receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Deferoxamine'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe symptoms (altered mental status, hemodynamic instability, persistent vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anion gap metabolic acidosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peak serum iron concentration (SIC) greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant number of pills on abdominal radiograph</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medical toxicologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regional poison control center should be consulted to determine the optimum dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> and duration of therapy.
