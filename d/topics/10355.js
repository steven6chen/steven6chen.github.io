Most meningiomas are benign (WHO grade I), although up to one-fifth of such tumors are classified as atypical (World Health Organization [WHO] grade II) or malignant (WHO grade III).

While the presence of one or more atypical imaging features may suggest high-grade histology, none of these neuroimaging findings is sufficiently specific to be clinically useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H1094512137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444764643\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical resection is preferred when a meningioma is in an accessible location, since complete resection of the tumor and its dural attachment can be curative, and extent of resection based on the Simpson grading system is consistently identified as an independent prognostic factor for both progression-free and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Multiple advances in neurosurgery, including microsurgery, neuroendoscopy, improved preoperative imaging, and intraoperative image-guided approaches, have extended the neurosurgeon's ability to resect lesions that were previously considered only partially resectable or unresectable, while minimizing damage to normal brain. The goals of surgery, the classification of the extent of surgical resection, surgical morbidity, and the perioperative medical management for all patients with meningioma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of known or presumed benign (WHO grade I) meningioma&quot;, section on 'Extent of resection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537373725\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT RADIATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical resection is generally difficult to achieve for malignant and atypical meningiomas, and partially resected tumors have a high rate of local recurrence as well as increased disease-specific mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is a standard component of initial therapy in patients with malignant meningiomas and subtotally resected atypical meningiomas in an effort to improve local control. For patients with atypical meningioma who undergo apparent gross total resection, the role of adjuvant radiation is less clear, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H537373553\" class=\"local\">'Atypical meningioma'</a> below.)</p><p>Newer RT techniques that have been used in small series include stereotactic radiosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], hypofractionated stereotactic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and heavy particle irradiation (proton beam, carbon ion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. No single approach has been shown to be superior to others, but they all reflect advances in conformal techniques. Selection of a specific modality is often limited by technical considerations; as an example, a tumor must be adequately small to be safely eligible for stereotactic radiosurgery. The delivery of RT for meningiomas using various techniques is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma#H444767541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of known or presumed benign (WHO grade I) meningioma&quot;, section on 'Radiation techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177501\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant meningioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant meningiomas are locally aggressive neoplasms with a very high rate of recurrence or progression, even after apparent complete resection. Adjuvant RT is a standard component of initial management for all malignant meningiomas, regardless of the extent of resection, in an attempt to improve local control and overall survival.</p><p>The natural history of malignant meningiomas and support for the use of adjuvant RT are derived from observational studies, most of which are small, single center retrospective analyses with heterogeneous pathological inclusion criteria and treatment approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Within these limitations, the data suggest that malignant meningiomas are associated with a recurrence rate of approximately 60 to 90 percent by five years after surgery and a five-year overall survival of 20 to 50 percent. Adjuvant RT appears to decrease the recurrence rate by about half and may improve five-year survival to greater than 50 percent. </p><p>Examples of contemporary studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The particularly poor prognosis in patients with malignant meningioma was illustrated by a series of 13 cases from a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All patients were classified as WHO grade III; in six cases, patients had previously been treated for benign meningiomas. All patients underwent surgical resection, but only three received adjuvant RT as part of their initial therapy. Surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT were used to treat recurrences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One patient died postoperatively, and 11 of the remaining 12 (92 percent) recurred (time to recurrence ranged from 0.4 to 2.8 years).

Actuarial recurrence-free survival rates at 2, 5, and 10 years after initial therapy were 80, 57, and 40 percent, respectively, and overall survival rates were 82, 61, and 40 percent. </p><p/><p>The optimal dose of RT for malignant meningioma is not well established, and several studies have suggested that a dose of greater than 60 Gy may be necessary to achieve durable local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/9,11,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12,17</a>]. We generally suggest a dose of 60 Gy when treating malignant meningiomas, based on the maximal safe dose deliverable to the surrounding normal brain. Even at this dose, local failures are not uncommon, however, suggesting that further investigation into safe dose escalation techniques and other novel strategies is needed to optimize outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537373553\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical meningioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical meningiomas are associated with an intermediate recurrence rate compared with benign and malignant meningiomas, and in some cases, particularly with progressive or multiply recurrent tumors, overall survival is shortened.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1443726395\"><span class=\"h3\">Incompletely resected tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who undergo incomplete resection or biopsy of an atypical meningioma, the rate of recurrence or progression ranges from 60 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Adjuvant RT improves local control, aims to prevent further neurologic morbidity related to growth of the residual tumor, and may improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Accurate delineation of the residual tumor following surgery using contemporary imaging studies is critical for optimal results with postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

For small tumors amenable to stereotactic radiotherapy, this technique can be used to maximize radiation conformality. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is sometimes used to treat small tumors, however there may be a higher risk of local failure at the margins and further studies with long term follow up are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172974046\"><span class=\"h3\">Completely resected tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who undergo apparent complete resection of an atypical meningioma, the role of adjuvant RT is debated. There are no randomized data available to guide decision making in these patients, and practice varies across centers. The potential benefits of adjuvant RT in terms of preventing or delaying tumor recurrence are more closely balanced with the risks and side effects of RT, and it is particularly important to assess individual patient preferences and tolerance for risk, which may vary when presented with similar information. &#160; &#160; </p><p>Based on contemporary series using the 2007 WHO grading criteria to define atypical meningioma, the reported recurrence rate after imaging-confirmed gross total resection in patients not treated with adjuvant RT is approximately 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/23,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26-28</a>].</p><p>Certain defining histopathologic features may be associated with a higher risk of recurrence than others, although this has not been well defined. Individual pathologic features that have been reported to independently increase risk for recurrence after gross total resection of an atypical meningioma include the presence of brain invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], a high number of mitoses per 10 high powered fields (eg, closer to 20 than 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/15,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30,31</a>], and prominent nucleoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Clinical risk factors reported in one or more studies include older age, non-convexity tumor location, and less than Simpson grade I resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>].

These potential benefits are weighed against the short and long term side effects and risks of RT. Factors that increase the risk of side effects or delayed toxicities of RT include advanced age, low functional status, large treatment volume, and proximity of the radiation field to critical structures such as the optic pathways or pituitary gland.

Overall, 30 patients recurred after apparent gross total resection without adjuvant RT; none of the eight patients who received adjuvant RT (59 to 61 Gy) recurred. For the entire cohort, the actuarial recurrence rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 7, 41, and 48 percent. All patients with a recurrence were subsequently treated with RT, and 22 of 30 (73 percent) had one or more additional surgeries.

At a median follow-up of over three years, the five-year progression-free survival rates with gross total resection, gross total resection plus RT, lesser resection alone, and lesser resection plus RT were 46, 78, 0, and 56 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis, both gross total resection and postoperative RT were associated with a better outcome.</p><p/><p>Other larger series have not found convincing support for the use of adjuvant RT in this setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the largest single-institution series that included 228 patients with atypical meningioma diagnosed between 1992 and 2011, 149 patients (58 percent) underwent gross total resection and the remaining patients underwent subtotal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients were treated with early RT (SRS). After a median follow up of 52 months, 22 percent of patients had recurred or progressed, at a median interval of 20 months.

For patients with WHO grade II meningioma using the updated criteria, two-year and five-year overall survival were 93 and 73 percent, respectively. Patients with malignant meningioma had significantly worse outcomes, with two-year and five-year overall survival rates of 57 and 42 percent. In a population-based analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry that included over 650 patients with atypical or malignant meningioma (classified both before and after the most recent WHO classification update), the median disease-specific survival for patients with malignant meningioma ranged from 42 to 70 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Aside from histopathologic grade, the most commonly reported risks factors for worse outcome are subtotal resection, large tumor size, and non-convexity tumor location (including infratentorial tumors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-atypical-and-malignant-who-grade-ii-and-iii-meningioma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Age has been inconsistently associated with outcome and may have a bimodal effect, with worse outcomes at both extremes of the age distribution. As with benign meningiomas, the quality of life of patients with atypical and malignant meningiomas can be impacted by short and long term consequences of the tumor itself, surgery, and radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-known-or-presumed-benign-who-grade-i-meningioma#H444768061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of known or presumed benign (WHO grade I) meningioma&quot;, section on 'Quality of life'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444764692\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical (WHO grade II) and malignant (WHO grade III) meningiomas are distinguished from benign (WHO grade I) meningiomas based upon specific histopathologic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60534\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60534 \">picture 1</a>). This distinction is important because these tumors are associated with a significantly increased rate of local recurrence and subsequent morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H2247447367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'WHO classification'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of atypical or malignant meningioma requires confirmation by histopathology, obtained at the time of surgical resection or biopsy. Neuroimaging features are not sufficiently specific to differentiate between low-grade and high-grade meningiomas without tissue confirmation. Imaging features that may raise suspicion for a higher-grade tumor include intratumoral cystic change, peritumoral edema, a decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient, and elevated cerebral blood volume. (See <a href=\"#H444764636\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete surgical resection is the preferred initial approach when a meningioma is in an accessible location, since complete resection of the tumor and its dural attachment can be curative. Atypical and malignant meningiomas are associated with a significantly increased risk for recurrence even after apparent complete resection, however, and adjuvant radiation therapy can improve local control. (See <a href=\"#H444764643\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H537373725\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of adjuvant radiation therapy varies according to the grade of the tumor and the extent of resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with malignant meningioma, we recommend adjuvant radiation therapy, regardless of the extent of surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2177501\" class=\"local\">'Malignant meningioma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with atypical meningioma who have undergone incomplete resection or biopsy, we recommend radiation therapy rather than observation after surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with atypical meningioma who have undergone gross total resection, the potential benefits of radiation therapy are more closely balanced with the risks of side effects and delayed toxicities. Factors that increase the risk of complications from radiation include advanced age, low functional status, large radiation field, and proximity of critical structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients who are at low risk for complications of radiation, we suggest adjuvant radiation therapy rather than observation after surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who are particularly concerned about radiation toxicity could reasonably choose not to undergo adjuvant radiation, in favor of watchful waiting with close imaging surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients who are at increased risk for complications of radiation, we suggest observation rather than adjuvant radiation therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who want to maximize the chance of avoiding a recurrence and are willing to accept the risk of treatment-related toxicity could reasonably choose adjuvant radiation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with atypical and malignant meningioma require active surveillance after initial therapy to monitor for recurrence. For patients with atypical meningioma, we obtain an MRI at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, then every 6 to 12 months for five years, then every 1 to 3 years. Patients with malignant meningioma typically require even more intense follow up. (See <a href=\"#H446744\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance after initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most recurrences of meningioma are local or adjacent to a radiation treatment field, and the majority occur within the first two to three years after resection. Additional surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy are commonly used to treat recurrent disease. Systemic therapy is generally ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H444764685\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical and malignant meningiomas are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and decreased overall survival compared with grade I meningiomas, and quality of life can be impacted by short and long term consequences of the tumor itself, surgery, and radiation therapy.
