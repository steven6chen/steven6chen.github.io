A few are conditionally essential, meaning that they are essential under certain conditions (such as vitamin D, which is essential in the absence of adequate sun exposure). Vitamins are divided into water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63827 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Many of the vitamin deficiency diseases, such as scurvy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>), beriberi (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>), and pellagra (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a>), have been almost completely eliminated in resource-rich countries, except in occasional patients with underlying medical disorders or highly restricted diets. Great interest and controversy continues into whether vitamin supplementation in pharmacologic doses can prevent cancer, heart disease, upper respiratory infections, and other common diseases.

In addition, it participates in initiation of nerve impulse propagation. Thiamine deficiency causes clinical phenotypes of beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Beriberi was described in Chinese medical texts as early as 2697 BC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> is primarily found in foods such as yeast, legumes, pork, brown rice, and cereals made from whole grains. However, thiamine is very low in white (&quot;polished&quot; rice) or milled white cereals including wheat flour because the processing removes thiamine. The thiamine molecule is denatured at high pH and high temperatures. Hence, cooking, baking, and canning of some foods as well as pasteurization can destroy thiamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Milk products, fruits, and vegetables are poor sources of thiamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thiamine deficiency is most commonly reported in populations in which the diet consists mainly of polished rice or milled white cereals, including some refugee populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322063297\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemistry</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemistry</strong> &ndash; Thiamine consists of a pyrimidine and a thiazole moiety, both of which are essential for its activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77100\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77100 \">figure 1</a>). The main active form of thiamine is a phosphorylated ester, pyrophosphate (TPP). Thiamine is soluble in water and partly soluble in alcohol. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolism</strong> &ndash; Thiamine is absorbed in the small intestine via both active transport and passive diffusion. The maximal absorption of thiamine is in the jejunum and ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thiamine is dephosphorylated to pass through the mucosal cells to enter the blood stream via a sodium and ATP-dependent pump (ie, active transport), then phosphorylated intracellularly to the active form. Bound to albumin, it is carried by the portal circulation to the liver. Thiamine enters most cells via active transport and enters red blood cells by passive diffusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The highest concentrations are found in the skeletal muscles, the liver, the heart, the kidneys, and the brain. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a>'s biologic half-life is approximately 10 to 20 days; due to limited tissue storage, continuous intake is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. The two entities are not separate diseases but a spectrum of signs and symptoms. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute syndrome requiring emergent treatment to prevent death and neurologic morbidity. Korsakoff syndrome (KS) refers to a chronic neurologic condition that usually occurs as a consequence of WE. It is characterized by impaired short-term memory and confabulation with otherwise grossly normal cognition.

This combination of findings is almost exclusively described in chronic alcoholics with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> deficiency. There may be a genetic predisposition for the development of WE since not all thiamine deficient patients are affected.

Mild deficiency is often undetected due to the mild nature and nonspecific signs and symptoms of deficiency. Riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) is characterized by sore throat, hyperemia of pharyngeal mucous membranes, edema of mucous membranes, cheilitis, stomatitis, glossitis, normocytic-normochromic anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis. Risk factors for riboflavin deficiency include anorexia nervosa, malabsorptive syndromes, and chronic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> and other barbiturates.

In resource-rich countries, pellagra tends to occur in alcoholics and has been reported as a complication of bariatric surgery or anorexia nervosa. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Deficiency (pellagra)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In high doses (1000 to 3000 mg a day), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a> is a well-established antihyperlipidemic agent, decreasing total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

Pantothenic acid deficiency is rare in humans but has been noted in severely malnourished individuals. Clinical manifestations can include paresthesias and dysesthesias, known as &quot;burning feet syndrome.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>) is found in the diet in several forms, including pyridoxine and pyridoxamine (from plants) and pyridoxal (from animal foods). Meats, whole grains, vegetables, and nuts are the best sources. Overt deficiencies of vitamin B6 are probably rare. Marginal deficiencies may be more common, manifested as nonspecific stomatitis, glossitis, cheilosis, irritability, confusion, and depression. Toxicity has been reported with long-term use of megadoses of pyridoxine (over 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> characterized by peripheral neuropathy, dermatoses, photosensitivity, dizziness, and nausea.

Symptoms of biotin deficiency may include a dermatitis around the eyes, nose, and mouth, conjunctivitis, alopecia, and neurological symptoms. Consumption of large amounts of raw egg whites can lead to biotin deficiency because the egg white impairs absorption of biotin. (See <a href=\"#H50\" class=\"local\">'Deficiency'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple carboxylase deficiency is a congenital disorder of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> metabolism caused by deficiency of biotinidase or holocarboxylase synthetase, enzymes crucial to the biotin metabolism pathway. These disorders are included in newborn screening programs in the United States and can be treated with pharmacologic doses of biotin.
