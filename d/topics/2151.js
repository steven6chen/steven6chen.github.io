Pain caused by vaso-occlusive episodes may occur as often as every week, or individuals with SCD may go with long stretches of time without any pain events. Many individuals with SCD also suffer from the long-term consequences of vaso-occlusive pain episodes in the musculoskeletal system, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral heads or collapsed vertebral bodies, leading to a chronic state of pain in addition to the more acute painful episodes.</p><p>Bone and joint complications in SCD are discussed here. Other manifestations of SCD are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VASO-OCCLUSIVE PAIN EPISODE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeated vaso-occlusive pain episodes are the hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Clinicians caring for children and adults with SCD refrain from using the term &quot;sickle cell crises&quot; when describing a vaso-occlusive pain episode because &quot;crisis&quot; does not appropriately depict the clinical situation.</p><p>Pain episodes can lead to bone infarcts, necrosis, and, over time, degenerative changes in marrow-containing bone. Pain episodes can occur in early infancy and into adulthood, and are a major cause of hospitalization in SCD. Among individuals with SCD in the United States, almost 90 percent of all visits to the emergency department are for painful episodes, as are almost 70 percent of all hospitalizations, with an average duration of 8 to 11 days for adults and 4 to 5 days for children. Similar numbers are found in individuals with SCD in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Cooperative Study of SCD (National Institutes of Health, United States), followed 3578 individuals with SCD prospectively (newborns, children and adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During 18,356 person-years of observation, 12,290 episodes of pain were observed, with an average rate of 0.8, 1.0, and 0.4 episodes per person-year in those with HbSS disease, sickle cell beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, and HbSC disease, respectively. However, even within the same genotype, marked variation occurred with regard to frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive pain episodes. As an example, almost 40 percent of all individuals in the study had no episode of pain during the observation period, whereas 5 percent of those in the study accounted for one-third of all episodes. Concomitant alpha thalassemia trait and higher hemoglobin S levels appear to be associated with more frequent pain episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of SCD hinges on the relative insolubility of sickle hemoglobin and its tendency to polymerize into long triple-helical chains when deoxygenated. The primary determinants of sickle hemoglobin polymerization are the relative concentration of hemoglobin S in the erythrocyte, and the extent of hemoglobin deoxygenation. A vascular environment in which blood flow is slow and hemoglobin undergoes progressive deoxygenation is therefore primed for the precipitation and polymerization of sickle hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemoglobin polymerization subsequently drives several changes in the erythrocyte, including mechanical disruption of cell integrity, ion fluxes across the cell membrane that result in cell dehydration, and alterations in the composition of the cell membrane. The net result of all these perturbations is increased fragility of the erythrocyte, manifested as chronic hemolytic anemia, and decreased deformability and increased &quot;stickiness&quot; of the erythrocyte that result in aberrant adhesion to other blood cells and the vascular endothelium, causing vaso-occlusion. </p><p>Chronic hemolysis and episodic vaso-occlusion induce numerous systemic pathologic processes, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammatory responses, activation of the coagulation system, nitric oxide depletion, and endothelial dysfunction; these cumulatively result in the myriad clinical manifestations of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. More extensive discussions of the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive pain episodes are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of sickle cell-associated musculoskeletal pain is a subject of much study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Vaso-occlusion can occur in a wide range of vascular beds, but the most common sites of clinically apparent stasis are the bone marrow, periosteum, and deep muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The slow progression of erythrocytes through marrow sinusoids and capillary beds, and the relatively hypoxic tissue environment, together increase the extent of hemoglobin deoxygenation and the likelihood of red cell sickling. </p><p>Complex interactions between sickled RBCs, activated WBCs, platelets, and endothelial cells, and circulating plasma proteins then lead to multicellular aggregates that eventually cause clinically significant occlusion of tissue vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The inflammatory response to ischemia and infarction leads to pain in the surrounding tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A detailed discussion of factors implicated in vaso-occlusion (eg, RBCs, WBCs, blood viscosity, endothelium, mast cells, inflammatory cytokines, epinephrine, pain perception, environmental factors) is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain in the ribs and sternum can lead to splinting and hypoventilation, which, in combination with fat emboli, increases the risk for developing acute chest syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Repeated vaso-occlusive pain episodes in vertebral bodies may lead to a collapse of the bony structure, leading to chronic pain, which sometimes can be managed only by the use of a brace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The acute chest syndrome in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of a vaso-occlusive pain episode in a bony structure is dominated by an acute onset of deep-seated pain, often described by the individual as &quot;typical sickle cell pain.&quot; Mild erythema and warmth, as well as local tenderness on palpation, are usually present, and many individuals have a low-grade fever. Pain can vary from mild (ie, barely interfering with normal activities) to excruciating (ie, &quot;worse than breaking a leg&quot;). Of note, other than localized erythema and warmth, which may not be present, no specific findings are associated with vaso-occlusive pain episode on clinical examination or laboratory evaluation. As such, the gold standard for both diagnosis and management of a pain episode is the individual's self-report of the location and severity of pain.</p><p>Differentiation between an acute pain episode and osteomyelitis can be difficult. However, acute pain episodes are much more common than osteomyelitis, usually respond within a few days to aggressive pain management, and typically present in an otherwise well individual with little or no fever. Individuals with fever of 101.5&ordm;F (38.5&ordm;C) or higher should have blood cultures and a complete blood count obtained to evaluate for the possibility of infection. In one case-control study of individuals with SCD that compared those who had osteomyelitis with those who had uncomplicated pain episodes, the major differentiating factors between vaso-occlusive pain and osteomyelitis were the preceding duration of fever (zero versus one days) and pain (two versus five days), swelling of the affected limb (absent versus present), and localized pain (&gt;1 painful site versus a single localized site) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fever in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>.)</p><p>Musculoskeletal pain episodes typically occur in the long bones. As an example, in a study of 192 children with SCD, bony infarctions occurred most commonly in the humerus (38 percent), tibia (23 percent), and femur (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although the long bones are affected most commonly, children and adults can present with vaso-occlusive pain episodes of virtually any bony structure containing red (erythropoietic) marrow, including ribs, sternum, vertebral bodies, and skull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74577%7EHEME%2F51573\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74577 graphicRef51573 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic findings are not specific for a vaso-occlusive pain episode. In individuals with pain episodes, plain radiographs initially do not show abnormalities, but necrosis and remodeling of bone results in increased radiographic density within one or two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Vertebral bodies typically show a biconcave deformity caused by bone marrow necrosis and subsequent collapse, which can result in severe chronic back pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68218\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68218 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In a typical acute pain episode, bone scans with Technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate show increased uptake, whereas a bone marrow scan with Technetium sulfur colloid often shows decreased or absent uptake in the area of the vaso-occlusive pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In a study of 14 participants with 28 painful episodes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed increased signals on intermediate and T2-weighted images in 36 percent of painful episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, neither finding is specific for vaso-occlusive pain and may be similar in a case of osteomyelitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107811541\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prompt intervention for vaso-occlusive bony pain is essential and may prevent many visits to the emergency department and subsequent hospitalizations.</p><p>All individuals with SCD should be educated to start treatment of vaso-occlusive bony pain episodes at home with heating pads, oral fluids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, as well as a mild opiate (eg, acetaminophen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. If appropriate home management fails to relieve the pain adequately, individuals need to be assessed for the need for intravenous opiates in conjunction other interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Management at home'</a>.)</p><p>Once they present to the clinician, it is essential that individuals with sickle cell-related pain are triaged rapidly and given appropriate doses and frequency of analgesic medications, and that these be initiated with less than 30 minutes of total wait time. Pain medication should never be withheld from children and adolescents with SCD for fear of rewarding drug-seeking behavior or testing the validity of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This principle also applies to the majority of adults with SCD. </p><p>Treatment of acute vaso-occlusive pain is discussed in detail separately. The major interventions consist of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydration (eg, 1500 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> orally or intravenously)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm packs to the affected area(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, including continuous infusion or regularly scheduled opioid dosing in most cases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous assessment of pain and monitoring of oxygenation and cardiopulmonary status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate provision of additional medication for breakthrough pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential use of patient-controlled analgesia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, due to risks of central nervous system toxicity with prolonged dosing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assurance of good pain control prior to discharge, with detailed plans for home management and outpatient follow-up</p><p/><p>Children with SCD and their parents often know which analgesic drug at what dose will provide the best relief, and medical personnel should take such knowledge into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Many SCD centers have established dedicated staff and space to function as a day hospital, allowing immediate treatment of pain episodes by knowledgeable staff, decreasing the lag time typically encountered in crowded emergency departments, and minimizing the need for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29</a>].</p><p>For children and adults with known concerns regarding drug-seeking behavior, a detailed home, emergency department, and inpatient care plan that is readily available to patients and care providers can be helpful in setting patient and caregiver expectations and reducing conflict between the individual and clinicians during acute exacerbations. Such a care plan can also facilitate appropriate pain management by clinicians who may be unfamiliar with SCD or with the particular individual's circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydroxyurea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> is used in children and adults with severe or recurrent vaso-occlusive pain episodes, based on strong evidence that hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of these episodes.</p><p>The indications, dosing, efficacy, and toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> in SCD are discussed in detail separately.

Children with HbSS or HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia were found to be significantly smaller than age-related healthy African-American children, although differences in height were less pronounced than were discrepancies in weight and sexual development. The exact mechanisms by which SCD results in impaired growth are unclear, but are likely multifactorial and include chronic anemia and systemic inflammation, episodic acute illnesses, endocrine dysfunction, and micronutrient deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>].

Bone and joint complications that might increase the risk of VTE include acute pain episodes, infection, and chronic immobility.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated vaso-occlusive pain episodes are the hallmark of SCD. Vaso-occlusive pain episodes lead to infarcts, necrosis, and degenerative changes in bone marrow-containing bone. Long bones are affected most commonly, but pain episodes can affect any bone marrow-containing structure, including the ribs, sternum, vertebral bodies, and skull. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differentiation between a vaso-occlusive pain episode and osteomyelitis can be difficult. Vaso-occlusive pain episodes are much more common than osteomyelitis, usually respond within a few days to aggressive pain management, and typically present in an otherwise well child with little or no fever. In individuals with vaso-occlusive pain, plain radiographs initially do not show abnormalities but may display increased roentgenographic density within one or two weeks. Plain films may not initially show any changes in early osteomyelitis, but they will show bone destruction in 7 to 10 days. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of vaso-occlusive pain consists of hydration, warm packs to the affected area(s), and a combination of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications. Early intervention at home can often prevent escalation of the pain episode. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Key elements of inpatient management include prompt and effective treatment of pain (usually with intravenous opioids), hydration, incentive spirometry, and ambulation if possible to reduce risks for acute chest syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H107811541\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with HbSS or HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and repeated vaso-occlusive pain episodes, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> (HU) can decrease the frequency of painful episodes. Preliminary studies suggest benefit for individuals with HbSC as well. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxyurea'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome) refers to vaso-occlusive pain episodes occurring in the small bones of the hand and feet. It typically occurs in infants and young children with SCD, and presents as painful swelling of the hands or feet, often accompanied by mild erythema and low-grade fever. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dactylitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with SCD are at risk for osteomyelitis and septic arthritis because of decreased splenic function and changes in bone structure. The clinical presentation is often similar to a vaso-occlusive pain episode, except that swelling and pain are more likely to be in a single site, and fever and pain are more likely to be prolonged. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis, AVN) of the femoral or humeral heads occurs in approximately 10 percent of individuals with SCD, and its prevalence increases with age. It may be asymptomatic or present with pain upon weight-bearing. Optimal treatment has not been established; options include conservative measures (eg, pain management and decreased weight bearing, physical therapy) and surgical core decompression. In general, we prefer to try conservative measures first, followed by core decompression in those who are not benefitting from conservative measures. Early detection and intervention may be of value in preventing or delaying progressive joint disease. Arthroplasty is generally delayed as long as possible given the high rate of artificial joint failure in individuals with SCD and the risks of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Osteonecrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with SCD have a disproportionate prevalence of low bone mineral density, possibly associated with a concurrent prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.
