Among patients with symptoms, fatigue and pruritus are most commonly seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50201 \">table 1</a>). In newly diagnosed patients, approximately one-half complain of fatigue and one-third pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, patients may have signs and symptoms due to associated autoimmune disorders or from complications of PBC, such as cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H58138901\" class=\"local\">'Associated autoimmune conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58139388\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fatigue:</strong> In patients with PBC, fatigue is associated with excessive daytime somnolence and can be a major factor that impairs quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. It may have several contributing causes, although it does not appear to be explained by depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. One report suggested that fatigue remains fairly constant over time in individual patients and that it may be associated with decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

It may initially develop during pregnancy and be mistaken for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. However, the latter disorder resolves in the postpartum period, whereas that due to PBC typically persists. Itching is worse at night, under constricting or coarse garments, in association with dry skin, and in hot, humid weather. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other signs and symptoms:</strong> Patients with PBC may report right upper quadrant discomfort, which was noted by 8 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Impairment in memory and concentration has also been reported in patients with PBC. In one study, these features were present in 53 percent of 198 patients with PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. They correlated with the presence of structural brain lesions and autonomic dysfunction, but did not correlate with the severity of liver disease.

The physical examination is often normal in patients who are asymptomatic. Skin findings are common, such as hyperpigmentation, excoriations, xanthelasmas, and jaundice. Patients may also have hepatosplenomegaly or examination findings suggestive of cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90943 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin:</strong> Skin findings in patients with PBC may include hyperpigmentation, jaundice, xanthomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75143%7EGAST%2F57793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75143 graphicRef57793 \">picture 2A-B</a>), xanthelasmas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67919 \">picture 3</a>), xerosis (dry skin), dermatographism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61550\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61550 \">picture 4</a>), and fungal infections of the feet or nails (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66643%7EDERM%2F61687%7EDERM%2F72013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66643 graphicRef61687 graphicRef72013 \">picture 5A-C</a>). The skin may initially be normal, but excoriations from scratching due to pruritus may be severe enough to cause bleeding and may occur as the disease progresses. In one study, 40 percent of patients with PBC presented with a dermatologic complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 25 to 50 percent of newly diagnosed patients have hyperpigmentation of skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This change is due to melanin deposition, not jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The cause is unknown, but similar findings occur in other types of chronic liver disease, such as hemochromatosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Jaundice is typically a later manifestation of the disease, but may be seen at presentation in some patients. Xanthomas from hyperlipidemia are also late manifestations that occur in less than 5 percent of patients. Xanthelasmas are more common and occur in approximately 10 percent of patients.

The frequency with which splenomegaly is present on initial presentation has not been well described. However, it appears to be decreasing, probably because PBC is being diagnosed in earlier stages than in the past. Splenomegaly becomes more common as PBC progresses and usually is a sign of portal hypertension.

Both the direct and indirect fractions are increased. An elevated serum bilirubin is a poor prognostic sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Serum levels of 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase parallel those of alkaline phosphatase.

They tend to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range. When they are five times normal or higher, the overlap syndrome (PBC plus autoimmune hepatitis) should be considered.

Other antibodies such as anticentromere, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSA/Ro,</span> and anti-dsDNA antibodies can be also found in PBC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">ANA have clinical significance in PBC for two reasons. First, their presence can cause confusion with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune <span class=\"nowrap\">hepatitis/PBC</span> overlap. Second, some suggest that ANA may be associated with more rapid progression of disease and a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/42,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45-47</a>]. However, the strength of this association and the implications for management are uncertain. For example, patients with PBC who are AMA-negative and have a positive ANA, a disease often called autoimmune cholangitis but more appropriately AMA-negative PBC, have the same outcomes as those who are AMA-positive and ANA-negative.

Typically, this is done with a right upper quadrant ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or if suspicion for a common bile duct obstruction is high, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A bile duct obstruction is likely if there is intra- or extrahepatic ductal dilation, if a mass is seen, or if an obstruction is seen on cholangiography.
