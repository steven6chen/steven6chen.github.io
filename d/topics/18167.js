Furthermore, no cause can be identified in many patients with acute hepatitis, whose course is consistent with acute viral infection. It has long been suspected that additional hepatotropic viruses will be detected to account for some of these cases. The newest additions to the named hepatitis viruses have proven not to exist (eg, hepatitis F) or to be unlikely candidates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gb-virus-c-hepatitis-g-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;GB virus C (hepatitis G) infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A novel virus associated with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology was first characterized in 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The virus (referred to as TT virus for the initials of the patient in whom it was isolated and subsequently from &quot;Torque teno virus,&quot; the official name given to it by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses), was detected in three of five patients who developed elevated serum aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations following transfusion (but without clinical hepatitis) and tested negatively for all known hepatitis viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Initial characterization of the TT virus (TTV) demonstrated several features that supported its role as a true hepatitis virus. Namely, TTV DNA titers were 10- to 100-fold greater in liver tissue than in serum, suggesting that it was hepatotropic and correlated with serum ALT elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These characteristics differed from the hepatitis G virus, in which hepatotropism and correlation of viral titers with serum ALT had not been observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gb-virus-c-hepatitis-g-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;GB virus C (hepatitis G) infection&quot;</a>.) However, these characteristics have not been confirmed in subsequent reports.</p><p>TTV is presently classified in the genus <em>Alfatorquevirus</em> within the family Anelloviridae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This family also includes two additional viruses of man, Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), thus named because of their smaller genomes (approximately 2.8 and 3.2 kb) relative to TTV (approximately 3.8 kb) and a large number of related viruses that have been found in a variety of animals and appear to be host species-specific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soon after its discovery, TTV was shown to be frequent in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/2,6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-14</a>]. Evidence of ongoing productive TTV infection (ie, plasma viremia) was initially found in approximately 2 percent of blood donors in the United Kingdom, 1 to 52 percent in the United States, 12 percent in Japan, 14 percent in Korea, 13 percent in Germany, 62 percent in Brazil, 11 percent in Spain, and 10 percent in Columbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]. However, increasingly sensitive techniques such as the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeted to conserved segments of the viral genome have subsequently demonstrated that TTV is much more widespread than initially believed. Indeed, prevalence rates of TTV viremia of over 80 to 90 percent among healthy individuals are more the rule than an exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/6-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-24</a>]. Given that TTV circulates in the bloodstream, it is not surprising that the infection is even more common in populations with parenteral exposure to blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Few studies have investigated TTMV and TTMDV, but their general and epidemiological features do not seem to differ substantially from those of TTV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Thus, anelloviruses represent a conspicuous, essentially constant component of the (normal) human virome.</p><p>TTV infection is acquired early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Indeed, the virus has been detected in the great majority of plasma or other body fluids from children aged two years or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Evidence of prenatal transmission between mothers and their infants has been demonstrated in some studies but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The virus has been detected in nearly all tissues of the body except the intact central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and is excreted with stools, urine, saliva and nasal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Since TTV appears to be highly resistant in the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], it has the potential to be transmitted through many routes as well as to serve as an indicator of general viral contamination of the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>There are no easy-to-perform tissue culture methods for growing TTV, and reliable serological methods for studying the antiviral antibody responses are still lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. As a result, diagnosis of infection relies solely upon detection of TTV DNA, and many aspects of the natural history of the virus, including the frequency with which acute infection leads to viral clearance, remain poorly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It has been demonstrated that TTV is shed into and removed from the bloodstream at rates comparable to other chronic viremia-inducing viruses such as the hepatitis viruses B and C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Indirect evidence has suggested that hemopoietic cells, possibly T lymphocytes, are an important source of the virus found in plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]; however, the full range of cell types that support TTV replication within the body is unknown, and also unknown are the consequences for the replicating cells.</p><p>TTV persistence has been demonstrated in approximately 90 percent of transfused patients followed for up to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These reports suggest an annual clearance of viral persistence of approximately 1 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/16,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,34</a>]. A higher clearance rate was suggested in another study that included 21 viremic subjects of whom 67 percent cleared TTV within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, these studies were performed using virus detection assays which, due to moderate sensitivity, were incapable of discriminating between true virus eradications and fluctuations of virus replication that brought the viral burden under the lower limit of detection of the specific assay used.</p><p>Plasma loads of TTV vary extensively in individual patients. For example, in a study of healthy subjects they ranged between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> DNA copy numbers per mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These variations reflect the replicating activity of TTV in the body as well as the number of genetic variants of the virus (see below) carried at the time of testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and the immunological status of the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It appears that immunosuppression may be associated with increasing levels of TT virus replication, suggesting a role for the immune system in controlling TTV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A variable fraction of the TTV virions found in plasma is bound to presumably virus-specific IgG or IgM. Whether these immunocomplexes remain infectious is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND REPLICATION OF TTV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virions are roughly spherical, approximately 30 nm in diameter, and non-enveloped. The genome is a circular molecule of single-stranded, negative-sense DNA of approximately 3.8 kb and consists of a coding and a noncoding region. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the coding region has indicated the presence of several open reading frames (ORFs), which overlap extensively, and five to seven virus-encoded proteins (possibly also resulting from different spicing) have been documented in cells transfected with TTV DNA. Although the genetic organization of different TTV isolates is well conserved, their genomes display a very high level of sequence diversity (see <a href=\"#H98643178\" class=\"local\">'Genetic variants of TTV'</a> below). Only the noncoding region contains a domain of about 130 nt, which is relatively well conserved among the different isolates. The mechanisms of TTV genome expression and replication are poorly understood. However, a specific amino acid sequence within the product of ORF1 (which also encodes the putative capsid protein) suggests that replication occurs via a rolling circle mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98643178\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC VARIANTS OF TTV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extremely high degree of DNA polymorphism represents the basis for the current subdivision of TTV isolates into a large number of genotypes or species (&gt;10 percent nt divergence), a number that has been increasing with the introduction of new molecular techniques of increasing sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The different genotypes are currently classified into five distinct phylogenetic groups designated 1 to 5 (&gt;40 nt divergence), which differ markedly in prevalence. For example, genogroups 1 and 3 are most common, while genogroup 2 is generally rarely detected. Coinfection by multiple TTV genotypes and genogroups is very common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/22,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40,41</a>]. There are suggestions that the different genetic variants are antigenically distinct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Whether there are also biological or pathogenic differences between them is essentially unknown.</p><p>Characterization of some TTV genotypes is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Among the most investigated are the ones also known as SEN virus (SENV), named after the initials of the patient in whom it was found. Described at first as an independent virus with several variants (designated A to I), SENV was later found to represent a number of genotypes within genogroup 3 TTV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Some centers have focused on these genotypes in an attempt to identify their clinical significance with no conclusive findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In a report from the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SENV DNA (types D and H) was detected in 30 percent of 286 patients with a history of transfusion compared with 3 percent of 97 nontransfused controls.

A study of 31 patients suggested that the response to interferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> may be impaired in patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SENV D and H [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In contrast, other reports found that SENV coinfection did not influence responses of HCV to therapy and that SENV itself could be cleared with interferon therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. A case-control study from Thailand found no association between SENV and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Transmission of SENV from mothers to their babies has also been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TTV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of TTV infections remains uncertain. However, contrary to what was initially proposed, it is now well established that TTV infections are <strong>not</strong> significant causes of liver disease. It has been suggested that TT virus may represent part of the normal human virome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with acute hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it cannot be excluded that TTV is responsible for acute hepatitis in selected patients or subsets of patients, such as those with immunodeficiency, several observations have led to the conclusion that TTV is <strong>not</strong> a significant cause of acute hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/35,57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,57-60</a>]. In a study involving healthy blood donors and patients who received a blood transfusion in a variety of settings, new TTV infection was observed in 26 percent of 182 transfused patients of whom 23 percent developed non-A to E hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, this rate was not significantly different when compared with patients who developed non-A to E hepatitis without new TTV infection, suggesting that TTV was not the cause of the unknown hepatitis. Similarly, the acquisition of TTV following liver or bone marrow transplantation has not been associated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Furthermore, injection of human TTV into chimpanzees, while capable of causing infection, did not induce illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with chronic liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most reports have found <strong>no association</strong> between TTV infection and biochemical or histologic evidence of liver damage in patients with chronic hepatic disease of unknown cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/17,35,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,35,62,63</a>]. In one study, for example, the prevalence of infection among patients with chronic liver disease of unknown cause was not different from that in controls without liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Furthermore, most patients who tested TTV positive had no biochemical or histological evidence of significant liver damage. In a report from the United States, no significant difference in the prevalence of TTV DNA was found between 99 blood donors who had elevated serum ALT compared with 146 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Similar findings have been found at other centers.</p><p>Several reports have found a higher prevalence of TTV infection in patients with known causes of chronic liver disease compared with control populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/15,62,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,62,64</a>]. However, in most, TTV did not appear to contribute to liver injury. In one series, TTV DNA was not more common among hemophiliacs with elevated serum ALT who were infected by HCV compared with HCV-negative controls, suggesting that liver injury was due to HCV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other studies have found no association between TTV and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with a variety of other predisposing conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these findings, a potential role of infection as a cause of chronic liver disease was suggested in a report from Japan, which found that the prevalence of TTV DNA was significantly higher in 57 patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology compared with 96 patients with hepatitis C (47 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. A report in children suggested that TTV may worsen liver histology in patients with chronic HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], TTV infection was present in 1 percent of 100 blood donors, 15 percent of 33 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, 27 percent of 11 patients with fulminant hepatic failure, 18 percent of 11 patients with cirrhosis who had a history of exposure to blood products, and 4 percent of 25 patients with cirrhosis without parenteral risk factors. It should be noted that many of the above studies were performed before the introduction of TTV detection assays of satisfactory sensitivity. However, it seems most likely that the reports of increased prevalence of TTV among patients with chronic liver disease may be explained on the basis of shared risk factors for infection rather than TTV being the cause or an aggravating factor of the liver disease. TTV DNA has been sought in a number of other settings related to liver disease. It does not appear to serve as a trigger for autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], and no association was seen with cryoglobulinemia in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. TTV does not appear to interfere with treatment of HCV with interferon; discrepant reports have been published as to whether it may be cleared during interferon treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/4,24,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with other diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTV has been associated with several conditions other than hepatitis, but confirmatory studies are needed. Potential associations have been described with systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], laryngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], periodontal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], cryptogenic fever of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Some evidence suggests that TTV may replicate actively in the respiratory tract of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>] and may possibly be a cause of acute respiratory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>] and an aggravating factor of chronic respiratory disease such as asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Most interestingly, the changes in TTV plasma loads have been advocated as a marker of the overall functionality of anti-infectious immune defenses in subjects with iatrogenic immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/33,84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,84-87</a>]. </p><p>Determining if associations with any other acute or chronic disease are causal is challenging because of the amazingly wide prevalence of the infection in the general population, the presence of the virions in many tissues, the existence of numerous genetic variants of the viruses, the frequent occurrence of coinfections by two or more such variants, and the wide range of viral loads that can be present in individual patients. In fact, these characteristics also challenge the adequacy of traditional approaches for establishing a causal relationship between an infectious agent and a disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TT virus (TTV) is presently classified in the genus <em>Alfatorquevirus</em> within the family Anelloviridae.

The different genotypes are currently classified into five distinct phylogenetic groups designated 1 to 5 (&gt;40 nt divergence), which differ markedly in prevalence. (See <a href=\"#H98643178\" class=\"local\">'Genetic variants of TTV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As yet, TTV has not been associated with certainty to any disease and the same applies to the other human and animal anelloviruses. In any case, contrary to what was initially believed, TTV does not represent a major cause of liver disease or contribute appreciably to the clinical course of patients with existing liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance of TTV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26843599\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mauro Bendinelli, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tt-virus-and-other-anelloviruses/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kodali VP, Gordon SC, Silverman AL, McCray DG.
