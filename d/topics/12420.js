This distinction helps to determine the appropriate laboratory and radiographic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Common causes of hip pain in children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious &ndash; Infectious pain is usually acute, localized, and severe (eg, refuses to bear weight); it is generally accompanied by fever, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory &ndash; Inflammatory pain typically is chronic or has insidious onset (with the exception of transient synovitis, which has acute onset); may be accompanied by other findings (eg, rash, nail pits, uveitis), involve joints other than the hip, and recur; refusal to bear weight is uncommon</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthopedic &ndash; Pain is usually localized to the hip but may be referred to the thigh or knee; may have acute or insidious onset; pain increases with activity and decreases with rest; systemic symptoms are absent; ESR and CRP are usually normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplastic &ndash; Pain is characteristically worse at night and unrelated to activity; may be associated with systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities (eg, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase or uric acid)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain from true hip pathology is typically experienced in the groin, though children and even adults may localize the pain to the thigh or knee. Lateral discomfort, for example around the greater trochanter, typically is caused by pathology outside the joint and is generally reassuring. Pain that alters function (limp, alteration in activities) should be explored fully, whereas transient or fleeting hip pains are typically of limited significance.</p><p>Important aspects of the history in the child with hip pain include the age and sex of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66131\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66131 \">table 3</a>); the onset, duration, severity, and location of the pain; associated systemic symptoms; past medical history; family history; and social history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63566 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute onset of hip pain, particularly when it is severe, is associated with infectious processes (eg, septic arthritis, Lyme disease, bacterial osteomyelitis), transient synovitis, and trauma. Hip pain of insidious onset is more likely to be caused by slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease (LCP), or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, formerly juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain (eg, refusal to bear weight) typically is caused by acute infections (eg, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis), malignancy (eg, leukemia, osteosarcoma), and trauma (eg, fracture). Less severe pain (eg, limps, but willing to bear weight) is more characteristic of transient synovitis, JIA, LCP, or SCFE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of previous episodes of similar symptoms in the same or contralateral hip increases the likelihood of JIA, in particular psoriatic JIA, or transient synovitis, which has a recurrence rate of up to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that affect the hip alone (eg, SCFE, LCP) are unlikely if the patient has joint pain at other sites. JIA rarely presents with isolated hip involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms increase the likelihood of infections, systemic arthritis, or neoplasms and decrease the likelihood of orthopedic conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65257 \">table 1</a>). Fever &gt;38.5&deg;C (101.3&deg;F) is associated with acute infections, but also with acute and chronic inflammatory processes (eg, systemic JIA, inflammatory bowel disease) and malignancy. Similarly, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness may indicate systemic disease that requires further investigation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent upper respiratory tract infection may suggest transient synovitis but is nonspecific; viral infections are common in children and also may coincidentally precede septic arthritis or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recent use of antibiotics can alter the presentation of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive family history of inflammatory arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or uveitis may be associated with JIA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avid sports participation, a fall, or other injury suggests traumatic hip pain. However, minor trauma occurs commonly in childhood, and initial symptoms of inflammatory or malignant disease often are attributed to an incidental injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual activity may suggest infectious (eg, gonococcal) or reactive (eg, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>) arthritis; however involvement of the hip is unusual.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination of the child with hip pain is targeted to determine whether the pain is coming from inside or outside the hip joint and whether it is an isolated problem or a manifestation of a systemic condition. The differential diagnosis is narrowed markedly by identification of arthritis affecting other joints and may also be informed by findings such as psoriasis or a change in the growth parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89604 \">table 2</a>). Thus the evaluation of hip pain requires a general examination, with emphasis on the musculoskeletal system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Examination of the painful hip should be performed after the remainder of the examination to optimize patient cooperation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Observation</strong> &ndash; The hip examination begins with simultaneous observation of both hips; the hips should be uncovered. The examiner should look for asymmetry of the pelvis, thighs, and knees. The position in which the femur and pelvis are held should be noted; partial flexion and external rotation of the hip may indicate increased intra-articular pressure. Swelling, heat, and overlying erythema rarely are identifiable on physical examination, regardless of the severity of hip disease. However, atrophy of soft tissues may indicate that the problem is long standing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Palpation</strong> &ndash; The hip joint cannot be palpated directly, but tenderness at the anterior superior iliac spine, greater trochanter, or elsewhere along the femur suggests a source of pain external to the hip joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Range of motion</strong> &ndash; Range of motion should be evaluated in both the supine and prone position. The pelvis should be stabilized as much as possible during examination of range of motion, since pelvic motion can compensate for loss of mobility within the hip. Prone examination is particularly helpful in this regard. With the knees flexed to 90 degrees and both feet caused to &quot;fall outward,&quot; subtle asymmetry in internal rotation is readily appreciated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67713\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67713 \">figure 1</a>). Hip extension is also best evaluated prone. Most patients with true hip pathology experience groin or thigh pain with internal rotation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with septic arthritis of the hip usually do not permit any range of active or passive motion, whereas children with septic sacroiliac arthritis or <span class=\"nowrap\">femoral/pelvic</span> osteomyelitis may permit gentle manipulation of the hip. In children with transient synovitis, the range of motion may improve markedly within a short interval of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration. Children with sacroiliac arthritis may have pain with maneuvers that torque the pelvis (eg, <strong>F</strong>lexion of the hip and knee, with <strong>Ab</strong>duction and <strong>E</strong>xternal <strong>R</strong>otation with <strong>E</strong>xtension at the hip [the FABERE test] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79475 \">figure 2</a>)).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ability to bear weight</strong> &ndash; The inability to bear weight is a sign of serious pathology until proven otherwise. Children who are unable to bear weight should not be sent home until a diagnosis is made and therapy instituted. Refusal to walk can arise from pathology outside the lower extremities, including the pelvis and spine; in particular, discitis or other spinal pathology may present in the young child as isolated refusal to bear weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory evaluation of the child with hip pain is directed by the findings from the history and physical examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an acute severe process, such as septic arthritis or osteomyelitis, is suspected, a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, acute phase reactants (eg, CRP or ESR), and blood culture should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with suspected septic arthritis also require arthrocentesis to obtain synovial fluid for Gram stain, culture, and WBC count with differential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme serology may be warranted if the child has arthritis and lives in or has traveled to a Lyme-endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Arthritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with chronic hip pain, or hip pain with insidious onset, acute phase reactants (CRP, ESR) and CBC can be helpful. Normal acute phase reactants suggest mechanical conditions; elevated acute phase reactants suggest systemic inflammatory disease or malignancy. Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia may suggest an underlying chronic illness, including malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely recommend HLA-B27 testing in the evaluation of hip pain in children. HLA-B27 is associated with a specific subtype of JIA (enthesitis-related arthritis). However, HLA-B27 has limited utility in the diagnostic evaluation because it is frequently observed in normal individuals and may be absent in some patients with enthesitis-related arthritis and other types of JIA affecting the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We also do not routinely recommend testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-DNA antibodies. RF is typically associated with a florid polyarthritis. Anti-DNA antibodies, which are used in the evaluation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), generally are not necessary because SLE does not cause isolated hip pain in children or adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Origin and utility of measurement of rheumatoid factors&quot;, section on 'When is it useful to measure RF?'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibodies-to-double-stranded-ds-dna-sm-and-u1-rnp#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibodies to double-stranded (ds)DNA, Sm, and U1 RNP&quot;, section on 'Anti-DNA antibodies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is necessary in all patients in whom septic arthritis, skeletal injury, or tumor remains in the differential diagnosis after history, examination, and initial laboratory evaluation. The imaging strategy depends upon the suspected etiology.</p><p>The need for imaging in children who present with mild hip pain and have a normal physical examination, normal laboratory values, and reliable follow-up is controversial. Some authors advocate following these children clinically without obtaining radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], whereas others obtain radiographs in all children with hip pain. Our practice is to limit plain radiographs to cases in which specific bony lesions are suspected (eg, trauma, tumors, advanced LCP, SCFE), in order to minimize associated gonadal radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs can identify bony abnormalities, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some forms of trauma (eg, fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67434\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67434 \">image 1</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors and other malignancies (eg, osteoid osteoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80598\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80598 \">image 2</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced (but not early) LCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52637\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52637 \">image 3</a>) or JIA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89795\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89795 \">image 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCFE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59157\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59157 \">image 5</a>), though early SCFE may not be evident on plain films</p><p/><p>Plain radiographs also can sometimes identify processes causing changes in the joint space, such as effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81582\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81582 \">image 6</a>), though small effusions often are not evident with this modality and radiographs can usually be omitted in cases in which a superior modality for evaluating the joint space, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will also be used to evaluate the soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>When plain radiographs are necessary, anteroposterior and frog-leg views are obtained (the frog-leg is the true lateral of the femur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The radiographic appearance of a child's hip varies with skeletal maturity, and images of the pelvis (ie, bilateral images) are sometimes recommended to permit comparison of the two sides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is an excellent technique for identifying small joint effusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60427\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60427 \">image 7</a>) and is useful for evaluating for inflammatory arthritis, including septic arthritis or transient synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. We routinely evaluate both hips. Bilateral effusions suggest a systemic arthritic disorder or transient synovitis because as many as one-quarter of patients with symptomatically unilateral transient synovitis have bilateral effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By contrast, septic arthritis is almost always unilateral.</p><p>Ultrasonography also may be used to guide aspiration of the hip when assaying joint fluid is deemed appropriate (eg, isolated unilateral hip effusion in a febrile child).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331318817\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI provides the highest resolution imaging of the painful hip. MRI can identify marrow changes suggestive of osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], early LCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63334\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63334 \">image 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and early SCFE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. MRI images are significantly degraded by motion. Sedation is necessary for patients who cannot remain still (eg, young or anxious children).</p><p>When inflammatory arthritis is in the differential diagnosis, MRI should be ordered with gadolinium contrast to distinguish synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane) from joint effusion; both appear &quot;bright&quot; on T2 weighted images, but synovial tissue enhances while joint fluid does not. Imaging with gadolinium should be performed with caution in patients with moderate or advanced renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When an acetabular labral tear is suspected (eg, snapping or catching of the hip and pain with internal rotation and extension in an athletic adolescent, particularly after activities that involve pivoting or twisting), an MRI arthrogram after intra-articular administration of contrast may be necessary to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H477156375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the hip in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Acetabular labral tear'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone scan is best reserved for situations in which MRI is not possible (eg, sedation is unavailable, medical <span class=\"nowrap\">devices/implants</span> that are not MRI safe) or if multifocal disease is suspected. Three-phase bone scintigraphy has historically been of great value in diagnosing the child with hip pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, MRI is preferable to bone scan in most conditions because of its superior anatomical resolution. (See <a href=\"#H331318817\" class=\"local\">'MRI'</a> above.)</p><p>Bone scans should be performed only at centers experienced in distinguishing normal from abnormal studies in pediatric patients. The epiphyses of growing children take up the tracer used in bone scans, complicating the interpretation of bone scans in children.</p><p>In the acute setting, a bone scan can be used to help differentiate septic arthritis or transient synovitis from osteomyelitis. In septic arthritis, the characteristic finding is increased uptake on both sides of the joint during the early or &quot;blood pool&quot; phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In transient synovitis, bone scan reveals diffuse increased uptake three to four hours after injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, in osteomyelitis, the bone scan generally demonstrates increased uptake on only one side of a joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61164\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61164 \">image 9</a>).

The epidemiology of septic arthritis of the hip is not well defined. An early peak appears to occur in the first months of infancy, with an overall average age of three to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hip-pain-in-childhood/abstract/4,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21-23</a>]. As with most infections, studies generally indicate that boys are affected more commonly than girls.
