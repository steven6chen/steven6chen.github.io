To provide optimal care, it is essential to distinguish whether cardiopulmonary abnormalities are caused by the stroke, unrelated to it, or in the case of cardiac arrhythmias, the cause of the stroke. The distinction is often difficult because preexisting cardiac abnormalities are highly prevalent among stroke patients.</p><p>In this topic, we will review some of the major cardiac complications associated with stroke. Other medical complications of acute stroke are discussed separately.

Furthermore, elevated troponin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. In another series of patients admitted with supratentorial ICH that excluded those who died within 12 hours of admission or were moribund, an elevated cardiac troponin level was seen in 10 of 49 patients (20 percent), but elevated troponin was not associated with outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140695105\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROGENIC CARDIAC DAMAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of subendocardial infarction or anterolateral ischemia (eg, ST segment changes or enzyme elevation) is common after stroke, particularly after subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H1387166746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Cardiac abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, an elevated creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is found in approximately 10 percent of stroke patients and tends to occur in a slow and delayed fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The development of actual myocardial injury (in as many as 20 percent of patients) can also be established by elevations of serum troponin I (&gt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> which is a specific marker of myocardial necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients with elevated troponin I concentrations are more likely to have electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and clinical evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome&quot;, section on 'Acute stroke'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is unlikely that the only mechanism explaining cardiac damage after acute stroke is the presence of underlying coronary disease, particularly since signs of cardiac damage are found in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who are often young and without underlying heart disease. In addition, the rapid appearance and disappearance of the ST changes argue against macrovascular factors and in favor of neural factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. Myocardial injury is most likely the result of a centrally mediated release of catecholamines due to hypoperfusion of the posterior hypothalamus. Subendocardial ischemia is an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and must be managed aggressively (although without the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac myofibrillar degeneration is often seen in patients dying from acute stroke, and is histologically identical to the cardiac lesions of catecholamine infusion, &quot;voodoo death,&quot; hypothalamic stimulation, or reperfusion of transiently ischemic cardiac muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The myofibrillar degeneration occurs in the vicinity of the cardiac nerves, and not in the macrovascular distribution seen in patients with coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. The lesion also differs from the necrosis seen in coronary disease because it is visible within minutes of onset, and the cells die in a hypercontracted state with contraction bands, associated mononuclear infiltration, and early calcification. Supportive care for patients with myocardial injury following stroke should include beta-blockers, since these agents may reduce sympathetic tone and may prevent arrhythmias and cardiac damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Cardiac stunning, defined as a transient decrease in cardiac function associated with ST and Q wave abnormalities and segmental hypokinesis, has been described with right hemispheric infarction and is believed to reflect transient coronary vasospasm secondary to increased sympathetic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Post-stroke cardiac stunning resolves a few days after the onset of the symptoms.

The presumed biologic basis for this association is the role of the insular cortex in the autonomic control of cardiovascular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/24,28-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28-36</a>].</p><p>While most agree that insular stroke can perturb the autonomic regulation of the heart, the differential impact of stroke involving the right and left insular cortex is not yet clear. Human data are sparse and derived mainly from observational studies. Furthermore, the reports are conflicting, perhaps due in part to differences in studies examining acute and chronic stroke. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study independently compared each voxel of infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with and without cardiac troponin elevation within three days of acute ischemic stroke to produce a map of brain regions associated with troponin elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients were excluded if they had a condition expected to cause acute cardiac troponin elevation (eg, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularization, etc). Brain regions associated with troponin elevation included the right insula (posterior, superior, and medial regions) and the right inferior parietal lobe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50996\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50996 \">image 1</a>). The right parietal lobe may have been included as a bystander, as it is within the territory of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery that often supplies the posterior insula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study compared 32 patients who had left insular stroke with 84 patients who had noninsular stroke or TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Over a one-year follow-up period, left insular stroke was significantly associated with adverse cardiac outcome compared with noninsular stroke (relative risk [RR] 1.75; 95% CI 1.02-3.0), and remained an independent risk factor of cardiac outcome in multivariate analysis. Left insular stroke was also associated with cardiac wall motion impairment independent of heart disease.<br/><br/>In the subgroup of patients without symptomatic heart disease, the association of left insular stroke with adverse cardiac outcome was even higher (RR 4.06; 95% CI 1.83-9.01), while in patients with symptomatic heart disease (acute myocardial infarction or angina) there was no association (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.06-2.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The latter finding was attributed to the protective effect of beta-blockers, as these medications were more likely to be used in patients with symptomatic heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that analyzed data from 2885 patients with symptomatic carotid disease enrolled in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), insular infarction occurred in 41 patients and none died suddenly over five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The long-term risk of sudden death was significantly increased for patients with left brain infarction compared with no infarction (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.45; 95% CI 1.00-2.10), nonsignificantly increased in patients with bilateral infarction compared with no infarction (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.98-2.00), and not increased for patients with right brain infarction compared with no infarction (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.62-1.47).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REPOLARIZATION AND ECG ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias or repolarization abnormalities occur after stroke in approximately 60 to 70 percent of patients and may have important prognostic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/16,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,39</a>]. Repolarization abnormalities are particularly important, as they increase the vulnerable period during which an extrasystole is more likely to result in ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>].

Patients with stroke have a 7- to 10-fold higher incidence of ST segment depression when compared with controls, particularly if the left middle cerebral artery territory has been affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/41,48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48,50,51</a>]. In one series, ST changes appeared to be more common among patients with ischemic stroke than among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>ST changes are generally most apparent in the precordial and lateral leads, and are usually transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although coexisting myocardial infarction occurs in 5 to 11 percent of patients with acute stroke, nearly 35 percent of patients develop new ischemic-appearing ST changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52</a>]. In patients over 65 years of age or with diabetes mellitus, ST segment changes are more likely to represent true myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53</a>]. ST segment alterations secondary to neurogenic heart disease also improve dramatically with brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Q waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aberrant Q waves identical to those observed in acute myocardial infarction are well recognized after acute stroke.

New Q waves have been identified in about 10 percent of patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>]. It seems unlikely that the ischemic changes seen on ECG tracings in patients with acute stroke result entirely from the coincidence of acute cerebrovascular and cardiac events, as the prevalence of acute myocardial infarction among stroke patients is lower than the incidence of pathologic Q waves.

One case-control study found new U waves in 13 percent of patients with acute stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. U waves were equally distributed between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, and there was no relation between the presence of U waves and stroke mortality.

In normal subjects, arterial blood pressure and heart rate decrease at night while heart rate variability increases, but this pattern is reversed in patients with coronary disease or stroke. The normal relative vagal dominance is replaced by increased sympathetic tone, and may account for the excess number of sudden deaths after stroke. This pattern returns to normal six months after a stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A significant proportion of cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with normal cardiac function, suggesting neurogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, the type and location of the stroke may correlate with the type of arrhythmia, with each cerebral hemisphere having a different influence on cardiac functions. Animal studies demonstrate that the sinoatrial node is under right-sided autonomic control, and that stimulation or inhibition of the right medulla, hypothalamus, and cerebral hemisphere exerts a greater influence upon heart rate than do comparable manipulations on the left.</p><p>Bradycardia and vasodepressor effects may be more common with injury of the right insula, while tachycardia and hypertension may be more common with injury of the left insular region. Evidence from experimental and observational studies suggests that supraventricular arrhythmias are more common after right than left hemisphere stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/48,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56</a>]. Since supraventricular tachycardia can be activated by an increase in sympathetic tone, it is hypothesized that the impaired parasympathetic tone caused by right hemispheric injury is responsible for the excess in arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-complications-of-stroke/abstract/23,39,45,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,39,45,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54662694\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious cardiac events and cardiac death after acute stroke may be caused by acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.

Angina, MI, and cardiac ischemia complicate 6 percent of acute strokes and constitute serious or life-threatening medical events in 1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68148 \">table 1</a>). In addition, a wide spectrum of regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, typically but not always reversible, can occur with subarachnoid hemorrhage and possibly with other types of stroke.

However, elevated troponin T after stroke may be a poor prognostic sign, and troponin levels may be useful in attempting to differentiate neurogenic left ventricular dysfunction associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage from dysfunction associated with myocardial infarction.
