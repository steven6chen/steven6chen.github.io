The clinical application of xenotransplantation has been a goal of transplant clinicians since the beginning of the twentieth century. Kidneys of animals were used during the first attempts at clinical transplantation because it was not readily apparent how human kidneys could be ethically retrieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Today, the shortage of human kidneys available for transplantation impels ongoing consideration of xenotransplantation.</p><p>The shortage of human kidneys for transplantation makes kidney transplantation unavailable for some and significantly increases waiting time for others. The increasing prevalence of end-stage renal disease with age makes these challenges worse over time. Other approaches to renal replacement, such as implantable devices, cell or stem cell therapies, and organogenesis are being explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, xenotransplantation could provide the most widely available and cost-effective approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Additional benefits may include the ability to prevent the recurrence of some infectious diseases (as animal organs are not susceptible to certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis B and C) and the ability to introduce extrinsic genetic material for therapeutic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Despite these possible benefits, xenotransplantation remains a matter of controversy. This controversy stems from the ongoing challenge of overcoming the immune hurdles to xenografting and the theoretical possibility that a xenograft may pose risks to public health by the introduction of infectious agents. A review of xenotransplantation and these challenges is presented in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF XENOGRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most obvious animal to use as a source of xenografts is one that is genetically close to humans, such as the chimpanzee. In the early 1960s, a series of transplants of chimpanzee kidneys into patients with renal failure were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These transplants functioned for up to nine months; in some cases, the cause of transplant failure and patient death was intercurrent disease and not rejection.</p><p>More recently, baboon livers functioned for months after transplantation into two patients with hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As with some of the chimpanzee kidney transplants, intercurrent illness rather than intrinsic failure of the livers resulted in patient death.</p><p>Although xenografts of chimpanzee kidneys appeared successful at the time, nonhuman primates are no longer considered as a source of xenografts because nonhuman primates are scarce and may harbor deadly viruses. Instead, nonprimates, particularly the pig, are preferred because they are available in unlimited numbers. Additional benefits are that porcine kidneys are appropriately sized for humans and have only a limited risk of transferring infectious agents (as discussed below).</p><p>Using technologies described below, swine kidneys have survived and functioned more than a year and heterotopic hearts more than two years in nonhuman primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Swine tissues, such as islets and hepatocytes, have functioned months longer. This progress encourages some to conclude that clinical application is imminent; however, comparison of allografts would suggest that further advances are needed to make these transplants clinically feasible.</p><p>Xenotransplantation might also be used in conjunction with organogenesis to generate functioning kidneys. With this strategy, animal cells committed to a renal lineage, particularly metanephroi, are isolated and transplanted into an appropriate recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Limited studies suggest that developing metanephroi surgically placed into the omentum of cross-species hosts (eg, pig to rodent) differentiate, grow, become vascularized, and exhibit excretory behavior.</p><p>In a still more advanced strategy, human stem cells might be generated from the cells of a person needing treatment and grown into renal primordia in an animal host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The human renal primordial cells could be harvested and transferred back to the person from whom the stem cells were generated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. Alternatively, human stem cells might be seeded on the decellularized matrix of an animal kidney to generate an &quot;engineered&quot; human organ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BARRIERS TO XENOTRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hurdles to successful application of xenotransplantation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunological responses of the recipient against the graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiological limitations of the graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethical considerations</p><p/><p>Although the following section addresses kidney xenotransplantation, this discussion also largely applies to cardiac, liver, and lung xenotransplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Without genetic manipulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe immune modulation, a pig organ transplanted into a human would succumb because of the following reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76845\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76845 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperacute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperacute rejection may arise in transplanted organs, whether human to human or across species. It is not observed with transplanted tissue or cells, such as pancreatic islets or hepatocytes. This severe reaction may occur within minutes to hours and would be observed in many, if not most, pig kidneys transplanted into unmodified human patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with renal allograft dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperacute rejection is characterized by the aggregation of platelets, formation of platelet thrombi, and the presence of interstitial hemorrhage in the recently transplanted organ. The dissolution of graft blood vessels and accumulation of neutrophils is sometimes, but not invariably, observed.</p><p>Hyperacute rejection of pig organs by primates is triggered by the binding to endothelium of &quot;xenoreactive natural antibodies.&quot; These antibodies predominately recognize Gal alpha1-3Gal, a sugar expressed by lower mammals such as pigs, but not by humans, apes, or Old World Monkeys. The anti-Gal alpha1-3Gal antibodies are believed to be similar to the isohemagglutinins that recognize blood groups A and B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Binding of xenoreactive natural antibodies to the xenograft endothelium triggers activation of the complement cascade, with activated complement mediating the rejection reaction. Xenografts appear to be particularly susceptible to complement-mediated injury because porcine complement regulatory proteins fail to dampen the activation of human complement on xenogeneic cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most evidence suggests that hyperacute rejection is caused by the accumulation of terminal complement complexes (C5b-9) on endothelial surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Deposition of terminal complement complexes causes an alteration in the shape of endothelium, which brings platelets into contact with underlying matrix, thereby triggering aggregation and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Although hyperacute rejection is arguably the most severe of all known immune responses, it can be prevented by one or more of the following strategies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depleting xenoreactive antibodies from the recipient's circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibiting complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This can be achieved by the administration of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1 (which inhibits the critical convertase enzymes of the complement cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]), or anti-C5 antibodies (which inhibit the assembly of terminal complement complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expressing the human complement regulatory proteins, decay accelerating factor (hCD55) or membrane cofactor protein (hCD46), in the animal organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Expression of these proteins can be achieved by making transgenic animals in which the genes for the human proteins are integrated into the porcine genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The use of transgenic organs as a means of preventing hyperacute rejection was first described by the author [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and the application to the kidney was first described by Cozzi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In both of these studies and in many subsequently published, transgenic porcine organs transplanted into baboons continued to function without evidence of structural damage well beyond the period when hyperacute rejection usually occurs (24 hours). Protection may be further enhanced with a triple transgenic animal that expresses hCD46, hCD55, and hCD59 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eradicating Gal(alpha)1-3Gal by knocking out (alpha)1,3 galactosyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of that sugar, in cloned pigs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. The transplantation of such kidneys into baboons has allowed the survival of renal xenografts for months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute vascular rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Also known as antibody-mediated rejection, acute vascular rejection can occur if hyperacute rejection is averted. Acute vascular rejection is recognized as the major hurdle to clinical application of xenotransplantation. As with acute vascular rejection of allografts, acute vascular rejection of xenografts is characterized by severe endothelial thickening, injury, ischemia, and thrombosis, with thrombi consisting of fibrin as well as platelets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although a variety of factors have been implicated, acute vascular rejection is triggered by antibodies directed against the graft blood vessels. Thus, depletion of xenoreactive antibodies from xenograft recipients or suppression of antibody synthesis by immunosuppressive agents can avert or delay the occurrence of acute vascular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Some antibodies that cause acute vascular rejection are specific for Gal alpha1-3Gal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/23,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,36</a>]. However, other antibodies, such as those directed against major histocompatibility antigen and other components of endothelium, can cause this process.</p><p>Although acute vascular rejection has been prevented in a few cases of pig-to-primate xenotransplantation, it remains a major therapeutic challenge. Among the approaches to preventing acute vascular rejection are the induction of accommodation, the induction of immunological tolerance, and the genetic engineering of xenograft sources to eliminate antigen expression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accommodation</strong> &ndash; When antibodies against a kidney transplant donor are removed from the circulation or temporarily prevented from causing the demise of the graft, the graft may undergo a process known as accommodation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This was first described clinically in blood-group O recipients of blood-group A and B donor kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, it is best characterized in xenografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accommodation is sometimes associated with expression in the transplant of &quot;protective&quot; genes such as heme oxygenase-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These genes inhibit the cellular machinery from contributing to injury caused by exogenous substances. Accommodation may represent a broader phenomenon in which the kidney and other organs exposed to noxious substances or cytokines acquire resistance to ongoing injury by expressing such substances or cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether accommodation can be achieved with sufficient regularity to make xenotransplantation clinically acceptable is yet to be proven. However, accommodation has allowed kidney allotransplantation to cross ABO barriers with success approaching that of ABO-compatible kidney allotransplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tolerance</strong> &ndash; A second approach to preventing acute vascular rejection is the induction of immunological tolerance, which is defined as specific nonresponsiveness to a foreign antigen or tissue. In general, immunological tolerance is the goal of all clinical transplantation. Because of the severe immune responses that would otherwise be uncontrollable, some investigators suggest that the successful application of xenotransplantation will ultimately depend upon the induction of tolerance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among the most promising approaches to inducing tolerance for xenotransplantation is the transplantation of donor bone marrow into recipients whose ability to mount acute immune responses is suppressed or eradicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Another possible approach is to inhibit &quot;costimulation,&quot; leading to the inactivation of B cells and T cells. Which of these, or other, approaches may work between highly disparate species is still unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic engineering</strong> &ndash; A third strategy to prevent acute vascular rejection is to genetically engineer the animal source so that the relevant antigens are not expressed and inhibitors of complement, inflammation, coagulation, or other beneficial proteins are expressed. The ability to clone pigs and to efficiently introduce multiple genetic changes places genetic engineering at the center of efforts to advance xenotransplantation toward clinical application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Organ xenografts from pigs with multiple genetic changes have functioned for more than two years in nonhuman primates, although not without heavy immunosuppression. However, the ultimate failure of other genetically engineered xenografts underscores both the opportunity and the limitations of genetic engineering. The failure of severe regimens of immunosuppression to establish permanent function and survival of xenografts might suggest that further modification of genes could improve the &quot;acceptability&quot; of animal organs. On the other hand, the transplantation of swine organs into nonhuman primates does not perfectly model transplantation into humans, because human genes introduced into pigs could be less than perfectly compatible with nonhuman primates and because therapeutic agents were optimized for humans and not for nonhuman primates.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cellular rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenografts, like allografts, are susceptible to cellular rejection. Critical questions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the cellular rejection of xenografts resembles the cellular rejection of allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This is under active investigation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the process can be controlled by immunosuppressive therapies. Immunosuppression used for allotransplant rejection appears to prevent the cellular rejection of xenotransplants over a period of weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and the production of large quantities of antibodies against antigens other than Gal alpha1-3Gal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Despite this, some argue that the cellular immune responses to xenotransplantation may be so severe that tolerance will also be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bane of allotransplantation is chronic rejection, a disorder that is also likely to undermine successful xenotransplantation. However, with xenotransplantation, but unlike allotransplantation, it is possible to replace a chronically rejected organ with another readily available xenotransplant.</p><p>The cause and treatment of chronic rejection of allografts are unclear. Among the possible causes of chronic rejection of experimental allografts and xenografts are antibodies directed against the transplanted organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. To the extent that such antibodies contribute to the rejection of clinical xenografts, the approaches discussed above for acute vascular rejection might also be applied to chronic rejection. Whether accommodation can be sufficiently durable and whether it could have a detrimental long-term impact are unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical imperative of xenotransplantation is the functional replacement of a failing organ or organ system. Thus, the function of the clinical xenograft is a pre-eminent issue.</p><p>It is unlikely that an organ xenograft, particularly a kidney xenograft, will function exactly like an allograft. Preliminary studies reveal, however, that transplanted pig kidneys can maintain normal electrolyte, acid-base, calcium, and phosphorus balance and blood pressure in baboons. Some report that monkeys and baboons with renal xenografts have hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>]. It is unclear, however, whether this complication reflects the limited capabilities of the transplanted kidneys or the complications of immunosuppressive therapy given in higher-than-normal doses.</p><p>Monkeys with renal xenografts also may develop a significant, nonhemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The administration of erythropoietin returns the hemoglobin concentration to near-normal levels. Incompatibility of regulators of coagulation and platelet function might also increase the risk of thrombosis and might be addressed by genetic engineering of source animals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of transferring an infectious agent from the xenotransplant to the recipient or community is one of the major hurdles to the clinical application of xenotransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Agents that cause pyogenic infections and influenza are among those that could infect a human if they were carried with a xenograft. However, nearly all (if not all) agents that are infectious for the pig can be excluded from potential xenograft donors by rigorous approaches to animal raising and isolation. In this way, a xenograft would probably be a less likely source of infection than a human allograft.</p><p>What cannot be excluded by these approaches are organisms that are endogenous to the porcine genome, such as endogenous retroviruses. The genome of all species contains retro-elements, and some have retroviruses capable of replicating and infecting.</p><p>The pig has a retrovirus known as porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), which is capable of infecting human cells in culture and murine cells in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Studies of human subjects to this point have failed to demonstrate that this virus can infect human cells in vivo, cause disease, or be transferred from one individual to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; however, PERV is capable of infecting human cells that may fuse spontaneously with swine cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Various reasons for the limited infectivity of PERV have been hypothesized, including natural resistance of the human host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In this author's judgment, clinical trials are required to determine whether this agent poses any risk for humans. If it proves to be a risk, genetic engineering has been successfully employed to inactivate at least some PERV inserts.</p><p>Additional potential human pathogens include herpesviruses, particularly porcine cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Tissue invasive disease due to this organism has been described in pig-to-primate xenotransplant models. Porcine cytomegalovirus, however, can be excluded from swine herds by early weaning of newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ethical aspects of xenotransplantation have been considered by various agencies, such as the Institute of Medicine in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], the Nuffield Council in Great Britain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and the International Xenotransplantation Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Although there are some individuals who oppose any use of animals for purposes such as xenotransplantation, these and other agencies have concluded that such opposition should not be public policy in societies that allow the use of animals as a source of food.</p><p>Of greater concern is the possibility that a xenograft may carry an infectious agent to the xenograft recipient and more broadly into society, thereby making the xenograft potentially a matter of public health. As indicated previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], there is no evidence that a porcine xenograft may carry novel infectious agents into the human population that would not arrive in humans through animal husbandry, slaughterhouses, and other agricultural activities unrelated to transplantation.</p><p>One potential exception is PERV, which apparently has not entered human populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, there is no evidence that PERV can infect or spread among humans as a result of xenotransplantation or other types of exposure to pigs. Nevertheless, because there remains concern about this issue, agencies in various countries have formulated public policies for the regulation of xenotransplantation and the screening and evaluation of recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE FUTURE INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the biological hurdles to renal xenotransplantation are overcome, the next critical question is which patients with renal disease would be most suitable to receive xenotransplants. This is particularly challenging because renal transplantation, unlike the transplantation of other organs, is not necessarily lifesaving, because dialysis is readily available in most countries. On the other hand, xenotransplantation might be especially appealing as the demand for transplants increases and because the cost could eventually be lower than that in other procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62</a>]. In addition, xenotransplantation might be preferred in certain medical settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Presensitized patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenotransplants may be initially considered for a limited number of individuals who are presensitized to multiple potential donors and are therefore less likely to receive an allograft. In this setting, the successful performance of xenotransplants assumes that anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies do not crossreact with porcine major histocompatibility antigens (SLA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-antibody-mediated-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection of the renal allograft&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal xenotransplants may be appropriate for young infants with kidney failure in whom dialysis is very difficult to perform. Such infants are also difficult to transplant because of the mismatch in size between the adult kidney and the infant. A xenograft could be used in selected cases to allow the infant to grow to a size that is more optimal for allotransplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-renal-transplantation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of renal transplantation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperoxaluria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenotransplantation might be explored as an interim procedure for patients with primary hyperoxaluria. Conventional transplant experience in these patients has been relatively disappointing because residual oxalate damages the transplant. A xenograft might be used as a temporary device to clear oxalate from selected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperoxaluria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperoxaluria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of renal transplantation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Human immunodeficiency virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with renal failure may be candidates for xenotransplantation since many transplant centers exclude such patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>). However, given the long-term survival of some HIV-positive patients with current therapy, a network of centers in the United States has been created where the feasibility of transplanting these patients is being evaluated in a systematic manner. Other transplant programs are considering the transplantation of HIV patients on an individual basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenotransplantation may enter the clinic in a stepwise fashion. In the past:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porcine livers have been used as devices for the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porcine skin has been used for the treatment of burns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porcine cells have been transplanted into patients with Parkinson disease and unremitting pain.</p><p/><p>The transplantation of porcine hepatocytes or islet cells, which do not require removal of or full replacement of function of the autogenous organ, may be undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. From these clinical activities, more precise information will emerge concerning the immune response to xenotransplantation and the risks of infection.</p><p>As a next step, xenografts might be undertaken as &quot;bridge&quot; transplants to provide temporary support until more definitive treatment can be performed, although it is difficult to envision how and under which conditions a porcine kidney might be used as a clinical bridge.</p><p>Bridge transplants will provide important information about the manifestation and control of the vascular responses to xenotransplantation. Only when these responses are effectively controlled over a period of months is it likely that the porcine kidney will be used as a permanent xenogeneic transplant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transplantation of cells, tissues, and organs between individuals of different species is referred to as xenotransplantation. The shortage of human kidneys for transplantation is severe, resulting in a heightened risk of morbidity and mortality and longer period of waiting for many in need of transplants. Xenotransplantation would eliminate this fundamental problem of clinical transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible sources of xenografts are nonhuman primates and nonprimates, particularly the pig. Specific benefits with using swine xenografts include availability in unlimited numbers, organs of appropriate size, and a limited risk of transmitting infectious agents. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sources of xenografts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are significant hurdles to the successful application of xenotransplantation. These hurdles include the immunological responses of the recipient against the graft, physiological limitations of the graft, infection, and ethical considerations. Powerful immunologic reactions lead to hyperacute, acute vascular, cellular, and chronic rejection. Specific measures unique to xenotransplantation have been utilized in the attempt to overcome these issues. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to xenotransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If biologic hurdles are overcome, kidney xenotransplantation could be used for select populations. These may include presensitized individuals, young infants with kidney failure, and others. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Possible future indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Future approach'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xenotransplantation-and-the-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jaboulay M.
