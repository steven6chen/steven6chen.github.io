These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H445562348\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically initiate antimicrobial therapy <strong>pending culture results</strong> for children who are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Febrile, immunocompromised, ill-appearing, have underlying genitourinary abnormalities or previous history of UTI</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Afebrile, immunocompetent, well-appearing, and without underlying genitourinary abnormalities or history of UTI if they have bacteriuria (with or without pyuria) on dipstick or microscopic analysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically initiate antimicrobial therapy <strong>only if the urine culture</strong> is positive in afebrile, immunocompetent, well-appearing children without underlying genitourinary abnormalities or history of UTI who have pyuria without bacteriuria (on dipstick or microscopic analysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial cystitis should be guided by local resistance patterns, urine Gram stain (if performed), and, ultimately, urine culture and susceptibility results. (See <a href=\"#H445562354\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that empiric therapy for uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis in children and adolescents include coverage for <em>Escherichia</em> <em>coli</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest a second- or third-generation cephalosporin rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), or a first-generation cephalosporin as the first-line agent for these patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94621 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, depending upon local resistance rates, TMP-SMX or a first generation cephalosporin may be an acceptable alternative to a second- or third-generation cephalosporin. (See <a href=\"#H445562360\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated cystitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coverage for <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em> (in addition to <em>E. coli</em>) also may be warranted for sexually active female adolescents or if the urine Gram stain or culture demonstrates gram-positive organisms. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitrofurantoin</a> for <em>S. saprophyticus</em> coverage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94621 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The most appropriate first-line therapy is suggested by local susceptibility patterns. (See <a href=\"#H445562360\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated cystitis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of therapy depends upon the age of the child and the clinical scenario. We usually treat the first episode of uncomplicated, afebrile cystitis in girls &ge;2 years and boys between 2 and 13 years for at least five days. We usually treat children &ge;2 years with recurrent, febrile, or complicated cystitis and male adolescents for 7 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"#H445562392\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients being treated for acute bacterial cystitis with an antimicrobial agent to which the infecting pathogen is susceptible should have clear signs of improvement (eg, resolution or decrease in lower urinary symptoms) within 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"#H445562398\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children and adolescents with uncomplicated cystitis have no long-term sequelae and little risk of recurrence.
