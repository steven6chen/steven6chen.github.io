Most commonly, thyroid hormone is used as augmentation for patients who respond insufficiently to antidepressant monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In addition, thyroid hormone can be started simultaneously with a tricyclic at the beginning of pharmacotherapy to accelerate response compared with tricyclic antidepressant monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, a faster response to treatment does not increase the number of patients who respond by the end of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thyroid hormone is generally administered as triiodothyronine (T3). &#160;</p><p>Interest in treating major depression with thyroid hormone initially arose in part because of overlap in the symptoms of major depression and hypothyroidism, including dysphoria, psychomotor retardation, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although diminished thyroid function is present in some cases of major depression, adjunctive T3 may be effective for depressed patients who are euthyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The use of thyroid hormone in treating major depression is reviewed here. Treatment resistant depression is discussed separately, as is the initial treatment of depression and treatment of hypothyroidism.

In addition, T3 should be used cautiously in elderly patients to avoid cardiac complications, and in patients with diabetes mellitus to avoid aggravating diabetic symptoms.

For patients who do not achieve remission, a reasonable goal is response, which is defined as stabilization of the patient&rsquo;s safety and substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms. Standardized rating scales such as the self-report Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] can be used to quantify response, but this is not standard clinical practice. Use of scales in treating depression is discussed separately.

Adjunctive treatment is often necessary because remission with antidepressant monotherapy occurs in only 28 to 47 percent of patients, even with an optimal trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. It is commonly thought that an adjuvant may be more effective for patients who initially have a partial response to antidepressant monotherapy, compared with patients who do not respond at all, but this is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Practice guidelines for treating unipolar major depression from the American Psychiatric Association, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry suggest adjunctive thyroid hormone as one of several options for patients who do not respond to antidepressant monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, the United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline suggests that clinicians should not routinely augment an antidepressant with thyroid hormone because there is inconsistent evidence of effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25559300\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with major depression who have not responded adequately to antidepressant monotherapy, the evidence supporting adjunctive thyroid hormone is mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of four, heterogeneous randomized trials (95 depressed patients unresponsive to a tricyclic) compared adjunctive T3 to either adjunctive placebo or thyroxine (T4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the clinical benefit of T3 was moderately large, and response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge; 50 percent) occurred in 53 percent more patients who received T3, the difference in the frequency of response between T3 and the control condition was not statistically significant (relative response 1.53, 95% CI 0.70-3.35). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An open-label, randomized trial examined adjunctive T3 as part of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study of unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

For frail, elderly patients, the initial dose is 12.5 mcg per day; if there is little or no improvement after one to two weeks, the dose is increased each week by 12.5 mcg per day, to no more than 50 mcg per day. </p><p>Studies have generally utilized daily doses of 20 to 50 mcg per day. In some studies, a lower daily dose (20 to 25 mcg) was increased after one to two weeks to the higher dose (40 to 50 mcg), whereas other studies started T3 at the higher dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, many studies required normal baseline thyroid indices as an inclusion criterion, and it is thus unclear whether patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as a normal serum free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated serum TSH concentration, might preferentially respond to adjunctive T3.

A meta-analysis of four randomized trials (444 patients with unipolar major depression) compared T3 plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with placebo plus an SSRI and found no evidence that T3 enhanced the effect of an SSRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A subsequent eight-week trial compared triiodothyronine (T3; 50 mcg per day) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> (50 to 200 mg per day) with placebo plus sertraline in 153 patients with major depression; response and remission were comparable for the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-augmentation-of-antidepressants-with-thyroid-hormone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27577869\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indication for treating nonpsychotic, unipolar major depression with triiodothyronine (T3) is augmentation, ie, T3 is added to ongoing antidepressant monotherapy because the patient has not responded adequately. In addition, T3 plus a tricyclic antidepressant can be started simultaneously at the beginning of treatment to accelerate (provide a more rapid) response compared with tricyclic monotherapy. However, a faster response to treatment does not increase the number of patients who respond by the end of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H27577771\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3 is contraindicated in patients with adrenal insufficiency, unstable angina, or recent myocardial infarction or compromised cardiovascular function. In addition, T3 should be used cautiously in elderly patients to avoid cardiac complications, and in patients with diabetes mellitus to avoid aggravating diabetic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H25560550\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial assessment of patients with unipolar major depression includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. Prior to prescribing T3, clinicians should screen for thyroid disease by obtaining a baseline serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration. A baseline electrocardiogram is not routinely required. However, a pre-existing cardiac condition warrants a consult from the patient&rsquo;s internist or cardiologist. (See <a href=\"#H2011945\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3 is generally preferred over T4 either for augmenting an antidepressant in unipolar major depression, or accelerating response. The initial dose of T3 is typically 25 mcg per day for one to two weeks, and if there is little or no improvement, the dose is increased to 50 mcg per day. We suggest that clinicians prescribe adjunctive T3 for at least four to six weeks before deciding whether it is helpful. (See <a href=\"#H25559990\" class=\"local\">'Choice of thyroid hormone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25559997\" class=\"local\">'Dose and administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25560004\" class=\"local\">'Length of an adequate trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive T3 at 25 to 50 mcg per day is usually well-tolerated. However, adverse effects consistent with hyperthyroidism may occur, including tremor, palpitations, heat intolerance, sweating, anxiety, increased frequency of bowel movements, shortness of breath, and exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmia. In addition, hyperthyroidism that emerges during long-term treatment may lead to bone demineralization, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H25560032\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H259472385\" class=\"local\">'Long-term treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exogenous-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exogenous hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who respond to adjunctive T3 continue to receive the T3-antidepressant combination for at least one year. Clinicians should monitor serum TSH concentrations every six months and decrease the T3 dose if the TSH concentration falls below the lower range of normal.
