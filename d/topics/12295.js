Assessment of amniotic fluid volume and Doppler velocimetry provide additional information about fetal status.

Studies in animal models support this premise by demonstrating that fetal biophysical activities (eg, heart rate, movement, breathing, tone) are sensitive to fetal oxygenation and pH levels, and changes in fetal biophysical activities occur in response to, or in association with, hypoxemia and acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, fetal biophysical parameters can be affected by factors unrelated to hypoxemia, such as gestational age, maternal medication, maternal smoking, fetal sleep-wake cycles, and fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/anomalies</span>.</p><p>Periodic fetal antepartum testing rarely identifies fetuses at risk of death from an acute hypoxemic insult, such as a complete placental abruption, and thus does not provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent these deaths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1695112957\"><span class=\"h1\">GOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of antepartum fetal assessment is to identify fetuses at risk of intrauterine death or neurologic complications of intrauterine hypoxia and intervene to prevent these adverse outcomes, if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1130113114\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antepartum fetal surveillance has had an established role in obstetrical practice since the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although its ability to improve pregnancy outcome has not been evaluated by large, well-designed randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Efficacy is based primarily on two lines of evidence: (1) observational studies that reported lower rates of fetal death in pregnancies that underwent fetal testing than among historic controls with the same indication for testing but no fetal testing and (2) the same or lower rates of fetal death in tested pregnancies (primarily high risk) than in a contemporary untested general obstetrical population (primarily low risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1917669979\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL HARMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gaps in the evidence regarding the efficacy of antepartum testing in preventing fetal neurologic injury or death preclude a definite conclusion about the benefits and harms of antepartum testing.

As an example, a randomized trial reported that women instructed to count fetal movements in the third trimester had a lower mean score on the Cambridge Worry Scale than women who received no specific instructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Potential costs include the actual dollars spent on tests and their interpretation, opportunity costs of patients' and practitioners' time spent in testing, and maternal and infant morbidity (or even mortality) from delivery for abnormal results, especially given the frequency of false-positive tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR FETAL SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' practice bulletin on antepartum fetal surveillance that suggests antepartum testing for &quot;pregnancies in which the risk of antepartum fetal demise is increased&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Although there is universal consensus opinion that women with decreased fetal movement should undergo further fetal assessment, available evidence does not support a clear fetal movement threshold or &quot;alarm limit&quot; indicating when the risk of fetal death or injury is increased and randomized trials of fetal movement counting for assessment of fetal well-being found no conclusive evidence of a benefit of this intervention. The available evidence, as well as approaches for counseling women about how and when to monitor fetal activity and evaluation of women with decreased fetal activity can be found separately.

FHR accelerations, spontaneous or provoked (eg, by vibroacoustic stimulation), have been shown to be a good indicator of normal fetal autonomic function and absence of acidosis and neurologic depression. Although a meta-analysis of randomized trials found no clear evidence that antenatal cardiotocography improved perinatal outcome, the quality of evidence was low or very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Disadvantages are that the false-negative and false-positive rates are higher than for the CST (a false-negative NST is when an antepartum stillbirth occurs within one week of a reactive test; a false-positive NST is a nonreactive test that is followed by a normal back-up test, such as a negative CST or high biophysical profile [BPP] score) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50223 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].

Only weak data support this hypothesis. A small retrospective study reported pregnancies with reactive NSTs and low amniotic fluid index (0 to 5 cm) were at increased risk for meconium and five-minute Apgar score &lt;7 at delivery compared with those with a normal amniotic fluid index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A study in post-term pregnancies reported decreased amniotic fluid and variable decelerations were associated with an increased incidence of fetal distress, even when the NST was reactive, but the performance of the combined test was similar to that of either test alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

This is the main rationale for assessment of amniotic fluid volume as an adjunct to the NST and as a routine component of the BPP. In addition, cord compression is more likely in the setting of oligohydramnios.

Doppler indices from the umbilical artery increase when 60 to 70 percent of the placental vascular tree is compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; eventually, fetal middle cerebral artery impedance falls and fetal aortic resistance rises to preferentially direct blood to the fetal brain and heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Ultimately, end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery ceases or reverses and resistance increases in the fetal venous system (ductus venosus, inferior vena cava) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/2,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30-32</a>].

The information derived from velocity waveforms varies according to the specific vessel interrogated. Umbilical artery Doppler is the most common Doppler technique used for fetal assessment where fetal hypoxemia is a concern. Fetal middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity is the best tool for predicting fetal anemia in at-risk pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1130112080\"><span class=\"h4\">Umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical artery Doppler assessments are most useful for monitoring fetuses with early-onset growth restriction due to uteroplacental insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The umbilical artery waveform pattern is compatible with a low-resistance system: forward blood flow occurs throughout the cardiac cycle. Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms of normally growing fetuses are characterized by high-velocity diastolic flow, whereas in growth-restricted fetuses, umbilical artery diastolic flow is diminished, absent, or even reversed in severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This progressive reduction of umbilical artery diastolic flow is associated with increasing obliteration of tertiary villi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In the growth-restricted fetus, absent or reversed end diastolic flow is associated with fetal hypoxemia and acidemia, and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,37</a>]. The technique for Doppler interrogation of the umbilical artery, as well as interpretation and use of umbilical artery Doppler, is described in detail separately.

When monitoring the growth-restricted fetus, umbilical artery Doppler should be used with standard fetal surveillance (nonstress test <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biophysical profile score).

In a systematic review of 16 randomized trials including over 10,000 &quot;high-risk&quot; patients where the definition of &quot;high risk&quot; varied among trials, use of Doppler ultrasound resulted in a variable decrease in perinatal mortality (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98, 1.2 versus 1.7 percent, number needed to treat 203) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In pathological states, such as fetal growth restriction, flow in the umbilical vein may be pulsatile, which reflects cardiac dysfunction related to increased afterload.
