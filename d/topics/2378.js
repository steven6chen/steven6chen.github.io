It is named for the Buruli district in Uganda, a region where many of the early cases in the literature were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Buruli ulcer begins as localized skin lesions that progress to extensive ulceration, leading to functional disability, loss of economic productivity, and social stigma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Since the 1998 World Health Organization (WHO) Buruli ulcer initiative, there has been increased attention to research efforts for treatment and control of Buruli ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. ulcerans</em> is the third most common mycobacterial infection worldwide in immunocompetent hosts (after tuberculosis and leprosy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Buruli ulcer due to <em>M. ulcerans</em> mainly affects individuals in humid, rural, tropical regions with limited access to medical care. It has been reported in about 33 (mostly tropical) countries, with the greatest frequency in Africa, particularly in the West African countries of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and B&eacute;nin (20 to 158 cases per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-21</a>]. Cases have also been described in other locales including Mexico, South America, Papua New Guinea, and Australia (where the disease is known as Bairnsdale ulcer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. In Victoria, Australia, and in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], transmission has been observed in moderate, nontropical climates. Buruli ulcer in Australia is spreading into new geographic areas, leading to an increased number of patients with severe lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The peak age group in West African studies is 5 to 15 years, although Buruli ulcer can affect any age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/19,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29,30</a>]. In Japan, the median age is 40 to 57 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and, in Australia, the median age is 50 to 66 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The disease has a low mortality rate, but its disabling sequelae have an enormous physical and socioeconomic impact on affected individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of <em>M. ulcerans</em> transmission is not fully understood, although the disease is known to be linked to contaminated water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>]. Areas affected by Buruli ulcer disease are located near stagnant or slow-moving water, and outbreaks appear to be related to environmental changes (deforestation, agriculture, hydraulic installations) involving surface water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/16,32,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32,37,40</a>]. Buruli ulcers have been observed more frequently during the rainy season in Africa, and exposure may occur in muddy farming fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/23,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,41,42</a>].</p><p>Transmission of the organism is probably via skin trauma. In an experimental guinea pig model, direct inoculation of skin abrasions with <em>M. ulcerans</em> failed to result in development of Buruli ulcer lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Insects may also play a role in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>] though not in all foci where transmission occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Water insects (<em>Naucoris</em> and <em>Belostoma</em> spp) have been implicated in laboratory transmission of infection, but their potential role as vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] has been questioned by studies in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In Australia, salt marsh mosquitoes appear to have positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/36,37,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,49</a>], while the highest quantitative signals (by real-time PCR) from the environment were obtained from fecal pellets of possums living in trees in the foci of transmission in Victoria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Intermediate hosts including aquatic animals may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/34-36,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36,51,52</a>]; amebae have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], but their role in transmission is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Human-to-human transmission is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Only once has the causative organism been isolated by culture from the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Buruli ulcer is caused by <em>M. ulcerans</em>, a slow-growing mycobacterium that can be cultured in vitro at 29 to 33&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. <em>M. ulcerans</em> is closely related to <em>M. marinum</em> (98 percent DNA homology), but <em>M. ulcerans</em> is unique among human pathogens in that it is capable of producing mycolactone, a potent cytotoxin that induces necrosis and ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria&quot;</a>). In Japan, a subspecies, <em>M. ulcerans</em> subsp <em>shinshuense</em>, has been identified as causing Buruli ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/27,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,63,64</a>].</p><p>The molecular structure of the mycolactones is well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/65-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-71</a>]. Mycolactones A and B are associated with African strains of <em>M. ulcerans</em>, while mycolactone C is associated with the Australian strains. Mycolactones A and B are more potent toxins than mycolactone C, but whether this reflects the clinical differences in disease severity is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Further understanding of the mycolactone production mechanisms and other aspects of <em>M. ulcerans</em> pathogenesis could facilitate development of a protective vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Mycolactones act by perturbing the cytoskeleton of several different host cells through activation of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>] by a mechanism that blocks protein synthesis post translation in the endoplasmic reticulum in target cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Host CD4+ helper T as well as other immune cells are also downregulated by mycolactone, resulting in transient systemic impairment of a Th1 phenotype immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>] as well as a more general transient downregulation including Th2, Th17, and Treg responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Mycolactone has been measured in tissues and in the bloodstream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. With successful antimicrobial treatment, mycolactone tissue concentrations appear to drop over time; in larger lesions, mycolactone may still be detectable after eight weeks of antimicrobial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Buruli ulcer usually begins as a painless nodule less than 5 cm in diameter. Less common forms of initial skin lesions include papules (described in Australia), plaques, and edematous lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85471\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85471 \">picture 1</a>). The limbs are the most frequently involved areas; other involved areas include the head, neck, trunk, and genital regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/3,4,83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,83-85</a>].</p><p>The initial lesion usually breaks down after days to weeks, forming an ulcer with characteristic undermined edges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77733%7EID%2F65909%7EID%2F53970%7EID%2F77234\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77733 graphicRef65909 graphicRef53970 graphicRef77234 \">picture 2A-D</a>). Ulceration tends to progress slowly and painlessly, and systemic symptoms are characteristically absent unless secondary bacterial infections or paradoxical responses occur. Studies have begun to unravel the role of paradoxical immune reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>] and secondary bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>], but their relative importance remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Patients with an initial edematous lesion (a less common presentation) tend to demonstrate relatively rapid progression, with tissue swelling leading to massive ulceration within a few days. They also tend to have associated pain and low-grade fever. Excess mycolactone production may play an important role in the pathophysiology of this form of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Superficial <em>M. ulcerans</em> infection can progress to involve deeper tissues including tendons, joints, and bones. Contiguous or hematogenous spread leads to osteomyelitis in up to 15 percent of cases, while involvement of other organs is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/14,84,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,84,91,92</a>]. Up to 25 percent of patients with osteomyelitis have no history of Buruli ulcer skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Disseminated disease in association with HIV has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/93-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-97</a>].</p><p>The natural history of Buruli ulcer includes spontaneous healing in up to one-third of cases; the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/13,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,98</a>]. Such healing is quite slow; it can take months and lead to deep scarring and retractions. Contractures can develop when the lesion is close to a joint, and more than half of patients have persistent functional disability years following acute infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90898 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F90899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90899 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/5,6,29,99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,29,99-101</a>]. In addition, extensive tissue destruction may warrant amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Buruli ulcers are readily recognized in endemic regions given their chronicity and characteristic appearance of undermined edges. The differential diagnosis of ulcerative lesions associated with Buruli ulcer includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tropical ulcer &ndash; Tropical ulcer occurs as a result of a necrotic reaction induced by anaerobic bacteria. It occurs as a result of exposure to vegetation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dampness; malnutrition may also play a role. It typically presents with margins that are not undermined (as is typical of Buruli ulcer) and not raised (as is typical for cutaneous leishmaniasis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous leishmaniasis &ndash; Cutaneous leishmaniasis typically begins as a papule that enlarges to a nodule with a central crust that drops off to expose an ulcer that is painless, chronic, and may have a raised border. Diagnosis requires demonstration of the parasite by histology, culture, or polymerase chain reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous leishmaniasis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eumycetoma &ndash; Eumycetoma is a chronic subcutaneous mycotic infection of the skin and soft tissue. Uncovered areas exposed to trauma are most commonly affected; the feet are most frequently involved, followed by the legs and hands. Lesions begin as painless nodules and swell, forming large tumors that evolve into necrotic abscesses and draining sinus tracts. The characteristic clinical triad includes tumor, sinus tracts, and macroscopic grains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eumycetoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eumycetoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyoderma gangrenosum &ndash; Ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum begins as a tender, inflammatory papule that develops on normal-appearing skin or at a site of trauma. The initial lesion expands peripherally and degenerates centrally, leading to ulcer formation. The lower extremities and trunk are the most common sites of involvement, though lesions may occur in other areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous stasis ulcer &ndash; Ulcers that arise as a result of chronic venous insufficiency occur between the ankle and the knee; the malleoli are the most common sites. Stasis dermatitis of the surrounding skin is common. Pain is not usually severe; patients with concomitant diabetes lack sensation and have signs of neuropathy on examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus and sickle cell disease may be associated with skin ulcers involving the lower leg. Diabetic ulceration occurs over weight-bearing areas as a result of diabetic neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular insufficiency. Leg ulcers associated with sickle cell disease occur near the medial or lateral malleolus and are frequently bilateral. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H4278105147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Leg ulcers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma &ndash; Squamous cell carcinoma frequently manifests as erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules; ulceration may occur. In addition, squamous cell carcinoma can develop in sites of chronic wounds, chronic inflammation, or scarring. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Nodules associated with Buruli ulcer generally do not cause significant symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onchocerciasis &ndash; The clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis are ocular changes, pruritus, subcutaneous nodules, and skin disease. The subcutaneous nodules associated with onchocerciasis are deep (not palpable) and typically appear over bony prominences. The diagnosis is established by biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipoma &ndash; Lipomas are benign adipocyte tumors that are asymptomatic and do not enlarge quickly; superficial lipomas rarely cause symptoms. The diagnosis is established by biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;, section on 'Lipoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidermoid cyst &ndash; An epidermoid cyst is a discrete, freely movable nodule; it is a benign lesion and often resolves spontaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin#H1101420445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;, section on 'Epidermoid cyst'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of plaques associated with Buruli ulcer includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eczema &ndash; Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that commonly occurs on flexor surfaces, whereas Buruli ulcer commonly occurs on extensor surfaces. In addition, eczema is associated with itching; Buruli ulcers are not pruritic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kaposi sarcoma &ndash; Kaposi sarcoma is an angioproliferative disorder that occurs in the setting of infection with human herpes virus 8. It is characterized by macules, plaques, and nodules on the skin. The course of Kaposi sarcoma is relatively indolent compared with that of Buruli ulcer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classic-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-features-staging-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classic Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical features, staging, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of edema associated with Buruli ulcer includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellulitis &ndash; Cellulitis manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth; it may be associated with fever. The presentation of cellulitis is more acute than that of Buruli ulcer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snake or scorpion bite &ndash; Local evidence of envenomation includes redness, swelling, blistering, and ecchymosis; necrosis may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Snakebites worldwide: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphatic filariasis &ndash; Lymphatic filariasis consists of lymphatic dilatation and abnormalities in lymphatic drainage; it is a more chronic condition than Buruli ulcer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphatic filariasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Buruli ulcer is frequently based upon clinical manifestations and is often not confirmed because of limited access to laboratory services. Laboratory diagnostic tools include staining for acid-fast bacilli, histopathology, mycobacterial culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid-fast staining &ndash; The most readily available laboratory technique is acid-fast staining of a swab taken from the undermined edge of an ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. In the setting of an endemic area with a strong clinical suspicion for Buruli ulcer, this test is only about 40 percent sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. In addition, the presence of acid-fast bacilli does not rule out other related infections such as <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> or other environmental mycobacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture &ndash; <em>M. ulcerans</em> grows slowly in the laboratory on Lowenstein-Jensen or liquid media (positive results require at least six weeks); the sensitivity of culture diagnosis is usually low but may approach 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Transmission is related to contaminated water; inoculation probably occurs via skin trauma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buruli ulcer usually begins as a small painless papule that breaks down after days to weeks, forming an ulcer with characteristic undermined edges. Sequelae may include osteomyelitis, scarring, retractions, and contractures. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most widely available laboratory diagnostic technique is acid-fast staining of a swab taken from the undermined edge of an ulcer. However, in endemic areas, the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer is frequently based upon clinical manifestations and rarely confirmed because of limited access to laboratory services. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For category I, II, and III disease, we suggest antibiotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The preferred duration of antibiotic therapy is eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Approach by WHO category'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild paradoxical deterioration may occur during antimicrobial therapy or in the two to four weeks following completion of therapy, reflecting antimicrobial killing accompanied by enhanced immune response. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Approach by WHO category'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery may or may not be needed. Any debridement should be limited to removal of necrotic tissue and delayed for at least four weeks following initiation of antibiotic therapy. Once the wound surface is clean and granulating, skin grafting should be planned. Surgery should be avoided for lesions at critical sites such as orbital, facial, and genital lesions. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Approach by WHO category'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications including joint deformities, and secondary bacterial infection may be diminished with physiotherapy and attention to wound care. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention measures may include limiting exposure to contaminated water sources, but a better understanding of transmission mechanisms is needed. Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination of neonates appears to afford limited protection, although mycolactone may be a good target for a more effective vaccine. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/buruli-ulcer-mycobacterium-ulcerans-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">LUNN HF, CONNOR DH, WILKS NE, et al.
