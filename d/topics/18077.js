They normally open all the way to let the blood flow through them. Blood comes into the upper right heart chamber (called the right atrium) from the body. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into the right lower heart chamber (called the right ventricle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In tricuspid stenosis, the tricuspid valve gets stuck and does not open fully. This makes the valve opening narrow. When this happens:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood can get backed up in the right atrium and the veins leading to the heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not as much blood flows out of the right ventricle</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365516920\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tricuspid stenosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with tricuspid stenosis have no symptoms. They might find out they have it when their doctor or nurse hears a heart murmur on a routine exam. A heart murmur is an extra sound in the heartbeat that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p>When tricuspid stenosis causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain (because the liver gets swollen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the belly, legs, or feet</p><p/><p>Some people with tricuspid stenosis also have a problem with another valve in the heart, called the mitral valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>). Mitral valve problems can cause trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365516952\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tricuspid stenosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for tricuspid stenosis and see how severe it is, your doctor will probably order an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats. It shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart is pumping, and how well the heart valves are working (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Your doctor might also order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This can show the size and shape of your heart, as well as changes in your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365517007\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tricuspid stenosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe your condition is. If you do not have symptoms from your tricuspid stenosis, you might not need any treatment. But your doctor will follow you to see if your tricuspid stenosis gets worse or you start having symptoms.</p><p>If you have symptoms from your tricuspid stenosis, you will likely need treatment. Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines used to treat heart problems &ndash; These usually include medicines called &quot;diuretics.&quot; Diuretics help reduce swelling by making you urinate a lot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to open the tricuspid valve &ndash; For this procedure, a doctor inflates a balloon in the narrowed tricuspid valve to try to open it. Doctors call this procedure &quot;balloon valvotomy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Your doctor might do surgery to fix your tricuspid valve or replace it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365517022\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
