Drug-induced exacerbation or decompensation of established HF is a relatively common occurrence. Its prevention requires frequent reassessment and meticulous management of often complex medication regimens.</p><p>Utilization of these drugs is common in patients with HF. In a study from Denmark, 34 percent of patients received at least one nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor after discharge for first hospitalization for HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-should-be-avoided-or-used-with-caution-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Use of some of these drugs may be increasing. As an example, a review of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with the diagnoses of HF and diabetes mellitus found that the proportion using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a thiazolidinedione increased from 13.5 percent in 1998 to 1999 to 24.4 percent in 2000 to 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-should-be-avoided-or-used-with-caution-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Management of patients with HF is discussed separately.

NSAID use is also associated with increased risk of renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia and impairment of responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics. Observational data in patients with HF indicated an association between NSAID (nonselective or coxibs) use and increased mortality. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Patients with heart failure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Heart failure and peripheral edema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While patients with HF and vascular disease (including coronary disease) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular risk factors may have indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, the risks and benefits of aspirin in patients with HF but without other indications are not well established. Aspirin use in patients with HF is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some initial studies suggested a possible deleterious effect of calcium channel blockers in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while later trials with the vasoselective calcium channel blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> showed a neutral effect on morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-that-should-be-avoided-or-used-with-caution-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Thus, there is <strong>NO</strong> direct role for calcium channel blockers in the management of HFrEF. However, amlodipine appears to be safe in patients with HF and can be used if treatment with a calcium channel blocker is necessary for another indication, such as angina or hypertension.

Monitoring of serum potassium levels is recommended for patients taking one or more of these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and additional monitoring is recommended after an MRA is added to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Routine use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is potentially harmful and should be avoided.

However, the nature of the relationship between androgen deficiency and HF severity is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictors-of-survival-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictors of survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Available data are insufficient to recommend androgen therapy in patients with HF as discussed separately.

During acute decompensation of HF, theophylline serum levels may increase, causing toxicity. Tachycardia and atrial arrhythmias may occur at serum concentrations considered therapeutic, particularly among patients with heart disease. If this drug cannot be avoided in HF, dose reduction with monitoring of levels or discontinuation of medication may be required.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General principles for avoiding drug-induced exacerbation of HF include recognition of the basic mechanisms by which drugs can exacerbate HF, identification of significant drug interactions, awareness of potential alterations in pharmacokinetics in the setting of HF, surveillance for changes in drug effects with changes in HF status, and monitoring the pharmacodynamic effects of HF management. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agent use in HF patients is associated with increased risk of HF exacerbation, increased renal dysfunction, and impairment of responses to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are lacking on the safety and efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>&nbsp;in patients with HF. While patients with vascular disease (including coronary disease) or cardiovascular risk factors may have indications for aspirin use, the risks and benefits of aspirin in patients with HF with or without vascular disease are not well established. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oral hypoglycemic agents thiazolidinediones and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> pose particular risks in patients with HF. Thiazolidinediones cause fluid retention and may precipitate HF. Patients with HF who take metformin are at increased risk of potentially lethal lactic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oral hypoglycemic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns have been raised about the safety of phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE-3) and PDE-4 inhibitors in patients with HF. Use of a PDE-5 inhibitor is contraindicated in any patient taking nitrate therapy. Limited safety and efficacy data are available on use of PDE-5 inhibitors in patients with HF. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Phosphodiesterase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most antiarrhythmic agents have some negative inotropic activity and some have proarrhythmic effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> is generally considered less proarrhythmic than other antiarrhythmic agents and is generally the preferred drug for treatment of arrhythmias in HF.
