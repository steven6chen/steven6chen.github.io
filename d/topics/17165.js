Although many interventional radiologists at local institutions have treated one or more PAVM, we believe that most PAVMs are best managed by referral to a center that has expertise in PAVM treatment, usually hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) centers <a href=\"http://www.curehht.org/&amp;token=RQvgI4CUD+onN4/T61VwBmhtCjyYQ3BPlxcCfCb1yro=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16891\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cureHHT.org</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Most of these factors are typically identified during the diagnostic evaluation but additional unsuspected PAVMs identified during pulmonary angiography may also be targeted for embolization.

As examples, for patients whose PAVM has a FAD &lt;2 mm on CT or who have atypical lesions on CT (or rarely a normal CT), who also have symptoms suggestive of an underlying treatable PAVM, we typically perform diagnostic pulmonary angiography with a view to identifying a potential PAVM(s) suitable for embolotherapy. Symptoms suggestive of a treatable PAVM include severe hypoxemia, paradoxic embolization (eg, stroke or brain abscess), and hemoptysis. </p><p>Support for this approach is derived from our clinical experience and rare case reports that suggest possible benefit from embolization of PAVM with feeding arteries &lt;2 mm, as well as from data extrapolated from the larger studies described above that report benefit to the more aggressive approach of embolizing smaller angiographically visible vessels, when feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/6,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148211016\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS NOT SUITABLE FOR EMBOLOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148210899\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic lesion and feeding artery &lt;2 mm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who are asymptomatic, and the feeding artery is &lt;2 mm, we suggest that they be followed with yearly clinical observation and a non-contrast CT every three to five years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102805\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102805 \">algorithm 1</a>). During observation, pulmonary angiography targeted at embolization of suitable pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) should be performed in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of a treatable PAVM or for PAVMs that enlarge over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148210905\"><span class=\"h2\">Poorly accessible lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, some patients present with lesions that require treatment (ie, feeding artery diameter &ge;2 to 3 mm) but are not technically amenable to catheter-directed embolotherapy. As an example, distal lesions with hyperacute branching of the pulmonary artery or of the feeding artery itself may make it technically difficult to access the PAVM for coil placement. In our opinion, an interventional radiologist with experience in embolotherapy in a center with expertise in PAVMs (usually a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia center) should be consulted before resorting to surgery for lesions that cannot be embolized due to technical difficulties. In the event that this approach fails, then surgical excision may be performed. However, in our experience with treating over 1000 PAVMs, we have never encountered a PAVM that could not be treated with embolotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H148211957\" class=\"local\">'Embolotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H148211196\" class=\"local\">'Surgical excision'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H419610703\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional patient populations may be considered at high risk for PAVM closure with embolization including those with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), coagulopathy, or comorbidities that affect procedural safety. </p><p>Special consideration should be given to those with severe PH, where PAVM closure may be associated with a rise on pulmonary artery pressures, although this finding is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, patients with severe PH may be at increased risk of sedation-related hypotension and cardiac collapse. All patients with PAVM and PH should be referred to a center with experts in both PH and PAVM management. While most experts agree that patients with severe PH are considered at increased risk for embolization, each case should be considered on an individual basis and take into account factors including the mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), PAVM size, and prior evidence of a PAVM-related complication (eg, stroke). For example, embolization may be less risky in those with PH when the PAVM is small and the PVR is low, while larger PAVMs and higher PVRs are considered to be at higher risk.

However, in a small percentage (&lt;20 percent) the pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) will not remain successfully occluded, the PAVM recanalizes, or a new PAVM develops. Common causes for failed embolotherapy include using too few coils, embolizing too proximally in the feeding artery, and using oversized coils. Failed embolization may be apparent immediately or develop over years. In all cases, repeat embolotherapy is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102805\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102805 \">algorithm 1</a>). Although the true outcomes with repeat embolotherapy are unknown, in our experience 80 to 90 percent of patients respond to this approach.

A detailed estimation of fetal radiation exposure suggested that pregnant women with significant PAVMs can safely undergo embolotherapy during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters. Safety is optimized by minimizing the field of view and fluoroscopy time, and waiting until after 16 weeks of gestation to perform the procedure.

It refers to the angiographic occlusion of the feeding arteries to a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) under fluoroscopic guidance. Principles of conscious sedation and indications for pulmonary angiography in patients with PAVMs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H706913933\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.) </p><p>The first component of the procedure is diagnostic contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiography, the purpose of which is to do the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm and characterize PAVMs identified on CT (suspected)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characterize PAVMs missed on CT (unsuspected)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify PAVMS that are potentially suitable for embolization</p><p/><p>Typically, diagnostic right and left pulmonary angiography is performed by injection of contrast through a percutaneous catheter (often inserted through a sheath in the femoral vein) positioned in the right and left main pulmonary arteries. This approach maximizes visualization of lesions suitable for embolization in both lungs. </p><p>The second component of the procedure is embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Once angiographically identified as suitable for embolization, lesions are then localized through selective contrast injections and treated by catheter-directed placement of embolic material (usually coils or vascular plugs) into the feeding artery of the PAVM until blood flow ceases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100434\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100434 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If coils are used, we prefer tight packing of two or more coils to effectively eliminate flow into the PAVM; this also reduces the risk of post procedural recanalization and the necessity for repeat embolization. (See <a href=\"#H148212168\" class=\"local\">'Embolization material'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple and even bilateral PAVMs may be embolized during a single session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and additional sessions may be performed after a hiatus of one to two weeks if additional PAVMs remain perfused, which is usually identified by the end of the procedure. </p><p>Diffuse multiple small PAVMs in the same segmental or lobar territory are a unique management challenge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102814\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef102814 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102815\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef102815 \">image 5</a>). Diffuse PAVMs are often too small and too expansive such that a single embolization procedure is not technically feasible; this is because coils need to be placed in a single feeding artery as close to the AVM sac as possible. Although attempts can be made to embolize discrete PAVMs with a feeding artery diameter (FAD) &ge;2 to 3 mm within a diffuse lesion in order to reduce the risk of stroke and cerebral abscess, it often has only a modest effect on the associated severe hypoxemia because shunting through the remaining unembolized PAVMs persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some experts address this issue by placing embolization material starting at the most distal component of the feeder vessel and then place additional coils in remaining parts of the vessel as they move in a retrograde fashion back through the level to the segmental or lobar pulmonary artery that feeds the diffuse PAVM territory; this technique that has been shown to reduce symptoms in some patients and should be performed in a center with expertise in the treatment of PAVMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Although the exact mechanism to explain the success of embolotherapy is unknown it is generally thought that PAVMS undergo thrombosis and sac retraction due to reduced flow and the presence of thrombogenic material within the PAVM feeding artery. Whether sacs undergo fibrosis is also unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H148212168\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolization material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of material used is typically institution-dependent. We prefer the use of nonferrous coils or vascular plugs due to our extensive experience with these materials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coils</strong> &ndash; Metallic coils (usually stainless steel or platinum) are used in many institutions. Optimal results are obtained when <strong>at least</strong> two coils are placed as close as possible to the AVM sac. In general, coils should be 20 to 30 percent wider than the feeding artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Steel coils, while used in the past are now generally avoided in favor of non-ferrous materials. If steel coils are used, MRI of the brain (in order to screen for brain AVM in HHT patients) should be deferred for at least six weeks to allow the coils to fibrose into position, thereby minimizing their chance of movement during the MRI. An advantage of using detachable coils is that they can be deployed and repositioned if necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular Plugs</strong> &ndash; Detachable nitinol vascular plugs have also been used to occlude PAVM since 2005. The later generation plugs and newer microvascular plugs are highly effective and can occlude a PAVM with a single device. Although there are scattered case reports of PAVM recanalization using plugs, a review of five case series reported only one case of recanalization following embolization of 199 PAVM in 131 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/8,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26-29</a>]. The vast majority of PAVM in these series were treated with early generation vascular plugs. Although this reperfusion rate is better than the traditional rate of 5 to 20 percent reported with coils, there are no studies reporting a head to head comparison of the two devices. The main benefits of vascular plugs are that they can be precisely deployed close to the PAVM sac, they can rapidly occlude PAVMs with large feeding arteries, and they have a low risk of device migration. Migration can be additionally avoided by sizing plugs 30 to 100 percent larger than the FAD. Their main drawbacks are that they are 5 to 25 times more expensive than coils and may take longer to occlude flow than coils. In one series the latter drawback was circumvented by deploying one or two platinum coils immediately after plug deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Balloons</strong> &ndash; Detachable balloons have been used in the past but are no longer available.

PAVMS are associated with significant morbidity and mortality (eg, stroke, cerebral abscess, massive hemoptysis). However, not all patients with PAVMs require definitive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H22766827\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True estimates of morbidity and mortality as well as natural history data are unknown because these data are mostly reported in retrospective case series. Morbidity and mortality associated with PAVMs are mostly associated with the development of serious complications including stroke and brain abscess, as well as life-threatening hemoptysis or hemothorax. Most PAVMs remain stable in size. However, approximately 25 percent will enlarge slowly, usually at a rate of 0.3 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span>. PAVMs do not spontaneously resolve. (See <a href=\"#H22767252\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-clinical-features-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults#H259348407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation in adults&quot;, section on 'Features attributable to PAVM complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all PAVMs require intervention. When indicated, most patients are treated with embolotherapy, angiographic occlusion of the feeding arteries to a PAVM under fluoroscopic guidance. Selecting who to treat is dependent upon factors including the feeding artery diameter (FAD), PAVM-related symptoms, and the patient&rsquo;s ability to tolerate the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102805\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102805 \">algorithm 1</a>).

A similar approach is suggested in patients with atypical lesions or PAVMs with FAD &lt;2 mm that are accompanied by symptomatic hypoxemia, paradoxical embolism, or hemoptysis. Embolotherapy results in an immediate improvement in the radiographic appearance of PAVMs, symptoms, and in oxygenation. Over the long-term, it also reduces the rate of serious complications especially neurologic events including stroke and cerebral abscess. (See <a href=\"#H823526253\" class=\"local\">'Feeding artery &ge;2 to 3 mm'</a> above and <a href=\"#H823526259\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H148211957\" class=\"local\">'Embolotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with asymptomatic PAVMs in whom the feeding artery is &lt;2 mm, we suggest that they be followed with yearly clinical observation, and a non-contrast CT every three to five years.
