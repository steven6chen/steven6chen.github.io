Primary infection with VZV causes chickenpox, with fever and a characteristic vesicular rash. Although varicella is usually a mild, self-limited illness, it can be associated with complications, such as pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and secondary bacterial infection. Complicated infection can lead to morbidity and mortality, particularly among immunocompromised hosts and pregnant women.</p><p>This topic will address the use of active immunization (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a>) and passive immunization (VariZIG) and other interventions for post-exposure prophylaxis in nonimmune individuals. The efficacy and safety of the varicella vaccine for routine immunization in children and adults are discussed elsewhere.

In healthy persons, reinfection with VZV is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Primary varicella is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in adults and immunocompromised hosts. Since the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> in 1995, there have been substantial declines in morbidity and mortality secondary to complicated varicella infection in the United States and Europe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-chickenpox-primary-varicella-infection#H519048387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)&quot;, section on 'Benefits of immunization'</a>.)</p><p>Endogenous reactivation of latent VZV typically results in a localized skin infection in a dermatomal distribution, known as herpes zoster (ie, shingles). Herpes zoster is most commonly seen in older adults (greater than 60) and immunocompromised hosts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878525\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the risk of transmission of VZV infection is higher with exposure to persons with primary varicella compared to herpes zoster. The period of contagiousness during primary varicella is estimated to begin approximately 1 to 2 days before the onset of rash. Persons with either illness are not infectious once the lesions have crusted over. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878532\"><span class=\"h2\">Person to person</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VZV is highly communicable during primary varicella, with secondary attack rates in susceptible household contacts greater than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. VZV is usually transmitted by infected secretions harbored in the nasopharyngeal mucosa via droplets deposited onto the mucosal surfaces of the conjunctiva or <span class=\"nowrap\">nasal/oral</span> passages. Other mechanisms include direct contact with vesicular fluids that contain virus or, rarely, through the airborne spread of virus.</p><p>Susceptible persons can also acquire VZV infection from exposure to persons with zoster, although the transmission rates are considerably lower and usually require close exposure to open cutaneous lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Suspected airborne transmission of VZV during zoster has been reported rarely in nosocomial settings.

The incubation may be prolonged for as long as 28 days after receipt of VariZIG or intravenous immunoglobulin and it may be shortened in immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors to consider prior to providing post-exposure prophylaxis include assessment of the risk of serious disease for the exposed individual, the nature of the exposure event, and the patient&rsquo;s susceptibility to VZV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879120\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has suggested that the following criteria should be used for evidence of immunity to varicella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Written documentation of varicella vaccination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior laboratory evidence of immunity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth in the United States before 1980</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster illness by a health care provider</p><p/><p>Self-reporting of past varicella infection by adults is considered valid evidence of immunity based on epidemiologic studies showing an excellent correlation between clinical history of varicella infection with VZV-specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Adults born before 1980 are generally considered immune. In addition, only 10 to 30 percent of adults with a negative or uncertain history of varicella are found to be VZV seronegative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, a history of varicella infection among young children is not a reliable indicator of past disease. In a cross-sectional serologic survey performed between 2004 and 2006, unvaccinated children were evaluated for a prior history of varicella infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A history of childhood varicella was not predictive of seropositivity among those born after 1994, while a history of clinical disease remained highly predictive of seropositivity among adolescents and young adults (&gt;99 percent positive predictive value). The ACIP recommends that evidence of varicella immunity in children should be established by the healthcare provider (through prior diagnosis by the clinician or documentation in the medical record). </p><p>Full term infants often have protective maternal antibodies until at least six months of age. The management of the newborn with varicella exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Management of exposure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879579\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of VZV infection in a susceptible person varies by the duration and nature of the exposure. All of the following should be considered events with potential risk: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indoor face-to-face contact with a person with varicella</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close contact with a person with herpes zoster</p><p/><p>Varicella is very contagious. Some experts consider exposures of more than five minutes of concern, while others contend that only those with more than one hour of contact are significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. However, there is general agreement that those with the greatest risk of exposure are household contacts where transmission rates are &gt;90 percent. </p><p>Transmission of localized VZV from a patient with herpes zoster is uncommon, but may occur within households with sustained exposure to open lesions. Persons with herpes zoster should be instructed to keep lesions covered, whenever possible, to decrease the risk of environmental contamination with VZV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of viral shedding in the environment was shown to be lower with use of an occlusive dressing compared to standard gauze bandages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-exposure-prophylaxis-against-varicella-zoster-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The risk of VZV transmission is higher among patients with disseminated zoster.<br/><br/>Rare transmission of VZV infection from a patient with localized herpes zoster has occurred without direct contact (presumably through airborne transmission) in the nosocomial setting.

Although varicella is usually a mild, self-limited illness, it can be associated with morbidity and mortality, particularly among immunocompromised hosts and pregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VZV infection causes two clinically distinct forms of disease: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). (See <a href=\"#H878311\" class=\"local\">'General background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the risk of transmission of VZV infection is higher after exposure to persons with primary varicella compared with herpes zoster. The period of contagiousness is estimated to begin approximately one to two days before the onset of rash during primary varicella. Persons with either illness are not infectious once the lesions have crusted over. (See <a href=\"#H878525\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essential factors to consider prior to providing post-exposure prophylaxis include assessment of the exposure itself, risk of severe infection, and the patient&rsquo;s susceptibility to VZV infection. Evidence of immunity can include written documentation of vaccination, prior laboratory evidence of immunity, birth in the United States before 1980, or a prior diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster illness by a health care provider.
