It is distinguished from non-small cell lung cancer by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and the early development of widespread metastases. Although considered highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, SCLC usually recurs within 14 to 15 months for patients with limited-stage SCLC and five to six months for patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Many of these patients are candidates for additional systemic treatment.</p><p>The median survival of patients with relapsed SCLC ranges from two to six months. The most important factors affecting prognosis are performance status, tumor extent (ie, limited versus extensive), and time to relapse after first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, the likelihood of an objective response to second-line therapy depends upon the time from last therapy to relapse, the response to initial treatment, and the performance status.</p><p>The treatment of relapsed and refractory SCLC will be reviewed here. The initial management of SCLC and experimental approaches to treatment are considered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensive stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=experimental-approaches-to-treatment-for-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Experimental approaches to treatment for small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734896588\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS AND EFFICACY OF CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-line chemotherapy generally is less effective than the initial treatment, but it can provide significant palliation for many patients. Symptom control and improved quality of life are the primary goals of treatment, and these must be clear to both patients and their families. While chemotherapy has been associated with improved quality of life outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], prolonged survival, increased time to tumor progression, and a reduction in tumor burden may also be achieved in some patients.</p><p>Single-agent chemotherapy generally is preferred because combination chemotherapy is associated with greater toxicity without an efficacy benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An exception to this approach is the use of the initial platinum-based combination chemotherapy for patients with a late relapse (&gt;6 months). (See <a href=\"#H643472456\" class=\"local\">'Sensitive disease (relapse after 90 days)'</a> below.)</p><p>One study has shown second-line chemotherapy improves overall survival and quality of life relative to best supportive care (BSC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. In a study of 141 patients with relapse &ge;45 days randomly assigned to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> (2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for five days every three weeks) or BSC, topotecan was associated with improved overall survival (26 versus 14 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients on topotecan also experienced slower quality of life deterioration and improved symptom control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2604834535\"><span class=\"h1\">REGIMEN SELECTION BY LENGTH OF RELAPSE-FREE SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to subsequent treatment takes into account whether a tumor has responded to therapy and, if so, the duration of response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111406\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111406 \">algorithm 1</a>). The length of response to initial treatment influences the likelihood of response to subsequent treatment. If the disease free-interval was less than three months from the last day of initial treatment (resistant relapse) or there was no initial response (refractory disease), most agents or regimens demonstrate low response rates (&lt;10 percent). However, if the time to relapse was greater than three months from the last day of initial treatment (sensitive relapse), the response rate is approximately 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H922140926\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory disease (no response)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in this setting. For patients with refractory disease or relapse within 45 days, we advocate participation in a clinical trial, as there are a number of investigational agents that have demonstrated activity in SCLC.

In such cases, there is no standard therapy. One agent that is frequently given in this setting is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>. (See <a href=\"#H540415853\" class=\"local\">'Other agents'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who are not candidates for further treatment or wish to avoid chemotherapy at any point, we use palliative measures such as radiation to symptomatic sites.

It is the only agent approved by the FDA for relapses that occur after 45 days from the completion of chemotherapy. Oral and intravenous (IV) formulations of topotecan have been extensively evaluated for the second-line treatment of relapsed SCLC and are found to be equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. Topotecan also has activity against brain metastases. The primary toxicities of topotecan are hematologic, with most patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. An acceptable alternative to topotecan is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, which may be less myelotoxic than topotecan. For those who cannot tolerate the camptothecins, other agents are available. (See <a href=\"#H540415853\" class=\"local\">'Other agents'</a> below.)</p><p>In a trial in which 211 patients with relapse &ge;60 days after completion of first-line therapy (usually platinum plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>) were randomly assigned to daily IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> (CAV), disease outcomes were similar between the groups, but symptoms were improved with topotecan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For topotecan versus CAV, the overall response rates were 24 versus 18 percent, the median time to progression was 13 versus 12 weeks, and the median survival was 25 versus 24.7 weeks, differences that were not statistically significant. Control of several symptoms including dyspnea, anorexia, hoarseness, and fatigue was improved with topotecan. Severe neutropenia was less common with topotecan (38 versus 51 percent), but grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred more frequently (9.8 versus 1.4 percent and 17.7 versus 7.2 percent, respectively). The improvement in symptom control led to its FDA approval.</p><p>The oral formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> appears to have similar antitumor efficacy and tolerability compared with the IV formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a phase III noninferiority trial, 304 patients with chemosensitive relapse (&gt;90 days) of SCLC were randomly assigned to oral (2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for five days) or IV (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for five days) topotecan every three weeks. Response rates were similar (18 versus 22 percent), as were median and one-year survival rates (33 versus 35 weeks and 33 versus 29 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The toxicity profiles of the two regimens were similar as well.</p><p>The utility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> for relapsed SCLC is not dependent upon age. In a retrospective analysis of four observational studies and a randomized trial, there were 161 patients &ge;65 and 319 &lt;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The objective response rate was the same in the two groups (14 versus 15 percent). The incidence, severity, and duration of grade 4 hematologic toxicities were also similar (in patients &ge;65 years versus &lt;65 years, anemia: 4 versus 3 percent, neutropenia: 77 versus 72 percent, and thrombocytopenia: 35 versus 24 percent).</p><p>As an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, three small clinical trials have evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> as second-line therapy, with objective response rates ranging from 16 to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. As an example, in one study, 44 patients (17 with sensitive relapse and 27 with resistant or refractory disease) were treated with irinotecan 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly times four with a two-week break. The overall objective response rate was 16 percent. The response rate was 35 percent in the patients with sensitive relapse, with a median survival of 6.8 months.

Topotecan has been evaluated on a weekly schedule in ovarian cancer and appears to be less effective than the daily schedule in that setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, whether differences also exist in the second-line treatment of SCLC is not clear. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Irinotecan</a> may be delivered in several acceptable dose and schedule options. We typically administer it at 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.</p><p>In the S0802 phase II trial, 192 patients with previously treated SCLC were randomly assigned to weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> after progression on a platinum-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Only two partial responses (1 percent) were observed in the entire study population (both in patients who also received aflibercept), and the median overall survival was approximately five months. Response rates of the daily times five every three weeks schedule were higher in other studies, on the order of 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These data are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2282680589\" class=\"local\">'Topotecan and irinotecan'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540415853\"><span class=\"h3\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other agents, including the taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, have modest activity in patients with relapsed SCLC, typically with response rates among previously treated patients on the order of 20 to 30 percent for the taxanes and 10 to 15 percent for the other agents. The evidence for activity of these agents comes from small, single-arm phase II trials conducted ten or greater years ago. These agents may represent an option for patients who are not candidates for camptothecins. Additionally, amrubicin has shown comparable activity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a> but is only available in Japan and has a high frequency of hematologic toxicity. For patients who have progressed on or are intolerant of a camptothecin, a choice of agents depends on the side effect profile of the agent and patient and provider preferences.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paclitaxel</a> is typically our first choice as an alternative to camptothecins given the response rates associated with this agent, though there are no data comparing them with other agents in this setting. Treatment considerations include the risk of neuropathy associated with these agents as well as steroid premedication and their associated risks. Paclitaxel has demonstrated response rates of approximately 30 percent in small prospective studies. In a study of 24 patients with refractory disease, paclitaxel (175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every 21 days) resulted in seven partial responses (29 percent). However, the duration of response was generally brief (median, 100 days), and there were four toxic deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another study evaluated 21 patients using paclitaxel 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly for six of eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Objective responses were seen in 3 of 11 patients with sensitive relapse and 2 of 10 patients with refractory relapse.</p><p>Next options for patients who have progressed or are intolerant of the camptothecins and taxanes include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a>. Given comparable efficacy among these agents, a choice among these agents must take into account the relative side effect profiles. Gemcitabine causes myalgias and flu-like symptoms, while vinorelbine is more frequently associated with neuropathy and requires a central line because of the risk of extravasation. Both can cause myelosuppression, with gemcitabine being associated with higher rates of thrombocytopenia. Temozolomide is associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and constipation. The disease outcomes associated with these agents are outlined below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gemcitabine</a> &ndash; Gemcitabine (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle) has demonstrated response rates of 12 percent among patients with either <span class=\"nowrap\">refractory/resistant</span> or sensitive relapsed disease, with an overall median survival of 7.1 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-and-relapsed-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In patients with resistant or refractory SCLC, a significant improvement in overall survival was seen for amrubicin (median, 6.2 versus 5.7 months with topotecan; hazard ratio [HR] 0.77).

The response rate was 45 percent, with an additional 19 percent with stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.5 and 7.9 months, respectively, from the time of rechallenge.
