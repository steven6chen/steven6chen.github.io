Persistence of erythema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic symptoms after this period of time should prompt consideration of resistant pathogens or alternative diagnoses. In such cases, culture data should be reviewed carefully, pursuit of radiographic evaluation for deeper infection is appropriate, and broadening antibiotic therapy to include coverage for gram-negative bacilli pending further diagnostic data is reasonable.
