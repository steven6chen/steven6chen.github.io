The vast majority of these are adenocarcinomas.</p><p>Surgical resection is the cornerstone of curative therapy for patients with potentially resectable rectal cancer. Radiation therapy with concurrent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy has emerged as an important component of curative therapy for transmural or node-positive rectal cancer because in contrast to colon cancer, in which the failure pattern is predominantly distant, the site of first failure can be local as well as distant.</p><p>Chemoradiotherapy is often administered preoperatively for clinically staged T3 or T4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), or node-positive tumors; for distal tumors, in which tumor regression may allow successful conversion of a planned abdominoperineal resection to a sphincter-sparing surgical procedure; or if the preoperative staging evaluation suggests mesorectal fascia invasion. Preoperative, as compared with postoperative, chemoradiotherapy results in a superior sphincter preservation rate, a lower rate of anastomotic stenosis, and better local control, while providing similar long-term survival. Good-quality surgery (total mesorectal excision [TME]) is also associated with lower local failure rates.

Without treatment, these patients have a short life expectancy that is often complicated by relentless pelvic pain, malodorous discharge, and uncontrollable tenesmus, which significantly impairs quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical nature and prognosis of locally recurrent rectal cancer have changed since the introduction of preoperative radiation therapy (RT):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RT reduces local recurrence at all subsites but is especially effective at preventing anastomotic recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, most recurrences after pelvic RT are not at the anastomotic site, and surgical treatment of nonanastomotic recurrences is more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients who present with a local recurrence after prior RT have simultaneous distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. As an example, in the Dutch total mesorectal excision (TME) trial, 83 of the 129 patients with a local recurrence also had distant metastases (63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One systematic review concluded that only approximately 40 percent of patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer are candidates for potentially curative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In part related to these issues, long-term outcomes seem to be worse after local recurrence in previously irradiated patients as compared with in patients treated initially with surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/9,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of therapy must take into consideration prior therapy, the local extent of the recurrence, and whether or not distant disease is present. For highly selected patients, surgery alone may be associated with long-term survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for most patients with an isolated local recurrence, combined modality therapy may provide better outcomes, particularly if patients have not been previously irradiated. Patients with distant metastases are usually approached initially with systemic chemotherapy to allow the natural history of the recurrent disease to declare itself. Some of these patients may eventually be determined to have potentially resectable distant (eg, liver, lung) as well as locally recurrent disease. For others who have unresectable distant metastases, palliation of pain, obstruction, or bleeding caused by a locally recurrent primary tumor may usually be achieved through a diverting colostomy or by nonsurgical means, such as with an endoscopically placed, intraluminal, self-expanding metal stent (for tumors not in the mid and distal rectum).

Pain is a more concerning symptom that may be associated with involvement or compression of organs, bone, or nerves.</p><p>Local recurrence after an abdominoperineal resection can present with a nonhealing perineal wound, a perineal mass, pelvic pain, or bowel obstruction that results from involvement of small bowel in the pelvic mass. </p><p>Up to 74 percent of patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer after combined modality therapy will present with synchronous distant metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/10-14,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation should focus on assessment of fitness for major surgical intervention, and staging of the tumor to ascertain the anatomy and the extent of local and distant disease. Locally recurrent rectal cancer is challenging to manage, particularly in patients who have received prior radiation therapy, and referral to a multidisciplinary team of specialists at a center with expertise in managing these complex cases is preferred. Frequently, input from experts in colorectal surgery, urology, plastic surgery, orthopedic oncology, neurosurgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology is needed to develop an optimal approach.</p><p>All patients with suspected locally recurrent rectal cancer should undergo a full clinical staging evaluation to exclude the presence of distant metastatic disease, including a computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and an integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan. Locally recurrent or metastatic disease should be confirmed by biopsy.</p><p>In addition to a digital clinical examination (which may require examination under anesthesia) and full colonoscopy to evaluate the anastomotic site and assess the remainder of the large bowel for synchronous lesions, the preoperative evaluation of any patient with a locally recurrent rectal cancer should also include pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In general, endorectal ultrasound is a less helpful modality than MRI for staging a local recurrence after prior surgical resection.</p><p>For women with a suspected anterior recurrence, a vaginal examination must be performed; rarely, cystoscopy is needed in the presence of hematuria or if the scans raise the possibility of bladder invasion. In addition, serum levels of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be obtained.

The final decision for resectability of a local recurrence is often made intraoperatively, with consideration of the location of the recurrence and the presence of osseous, adjacent organ, vascular, lymphatic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nerve root involvement.</p><p>Another important point is that on pretreatment imaging, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft tissue from ongoing inflammation that is mildly fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avid and actual tumor recurrence. Biopsies of this area can be difficult, and a negative result may not be reliable. Sometimes, serial imaging is needed to distinguish between fibrosis and recurrent cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2219228486\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic confirmation of the recurrence is an important step before proceeding with extensive radical surgery, especially if induction chemoradiotherapy is planned. This may be accomplished by colonoscopy for an intraluminal recurrence. When the tumor is not accessible by endoscopy, CT-guided biopsy can often be performed.</p><p>When a tissue diagnosis cannot be obtained (eg, as a result of the location of the recurrence or if there is a significant degree of surrounding fibrosis) and there is convincing radiologic evidence of recurrence (eg, highly suggestive PET scan or serial radiologic examinations that demonstrate progressive enlargement of a suspected recurrent mass), it is reasonable to pursue multimodality treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2325845710\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of recurrence pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative imaging studies and operative findings are used to categorize the recurrence. There is no universal consensus on the best way to classify locally recurrent rectal cancer for the purpose of prognostication and treatment selection. Several have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A system proposed by the Mayo Clinic classifies patients into groups based on the presence of pain (S0 = asymptomatic; S1 = symptomatic without pain; S2 = symptomatic with pain) and the degree of fixation to anatomical structures located at the anterior, sacral, left, and right sides of the pelvis (F0 = not fixed to any site; F1 = fixed to one site; F2 = fixed at two sites; F3 = fixed at three sites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. While the degree of fixation and pain did not appear to adversely affect survival in their initial report, a subsequent series with more patients indicated significantly reduced survival with symptomatic pain and more than one point of fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different classification system proposed by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was based upon the anatomical location of the recurrence within the pelvis and the structures that were involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Recurrences were defined as one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Axial &ndash; Anastomotic recurrence after low anterior resection, perineal recurrence after abdominoperineal resection, or local recurrence after transanal excision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anterior &ndash; Involving urologic or gynecologic organs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Posterior &ndash; Involving the sacrum or coccyx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lateral &ndash; Involving the pelvic sidewall structures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Using this system, tumors with a lateral component had a significantly reduced likelihood of a microscopically complete (R0) resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another classification of patterns of invasion was proposed by the Leeds group in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central &ndash; Tumor confined to pelvic organs or connective tissue without contact or invasion into bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sacral &ndash; Tumor present in the presacral space and abuts into or invades into the sacrum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sidewall &ndash; Tumor involving the structures on the lateral pelvic sidewall, including the greater sciatic foramen, and the sciatic nerve through to the piriformis and the gluteal region</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Composite &ndash; Sacral and sidewall recurrence combined</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This group did not address the prognostic or therapeutic implications of the classification system; however, they did provide an algorithmic approach to surgical management based upon the location of the recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3393371401\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete radical resection is a prerequisite for cure; outcomes are superior if microscopically complete (R0) resection can be achieved, even if this requires an extensive operative procedure (eg, pelvic exenteration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. In these settings, the benefits of surgery (potential for cure, improved symptoms, quality of life) must be weighed against the postoperative morbidity, possibility of multiple permanent stomas, chronic pain, and even the limited survival that result from aggressive surgery.</p><p>Complete surgical removal offers the only hope for long-term survival in locally recurrent rectal cancer. External beam radiation therapy (RT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy alone may successfully palliate symptoms and prolong median survival to 12 to 15 months (compared with a median survival of three to eight months for untreated local recurrence), but five-year survival rates are &lt;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/18,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,34-37</a>]. </p><p>At some institutions, surgical resection alone is pursued for a small subset of patients with an isolated, small, central recurrence at the anastomotic site given some reports of long-term survival if the recurrence can be completely resected with negative margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/16,38-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38-45</a>].

In our view, surgery alone should not be utilized in the management of a local recurrence, particularly if RT has not been previously utilized. Even if it has been given within the past year, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may still be an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Role of intraoperative RT'</a> below.)</p><p>Aggressive attempts to obtain microscopically negative margins are warranted because a negative-margin resection is the single most important predictor of cancer-specific survival in patients undergoing surgery for recurrent rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/28,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,49-53</a>].</p><p>For more extensive recurrences, a more extensive surgical procedure (eg, posterior or total pelvic exenteration for an anteriorly located recurrence, abdominosacral resection or partial sacrectomy for a posteriorly located recurrence) may be required. In these settings, the benefits of surgery (potential for cure, improved symptoms, quality of life) must be weighed against the surgical morbidity, possibility of multiple permanent stomas, chronic pain, and even limited survival that result from aggressive surgery.

Additional chemotherapy (leucovorin-modulated fluorouracil) was given for 16 weeks after surgery as adjuvant chemotherapy. None of the patients with locally recurrent tumors had been previously irradiated. </p><p>In the entire population, compared with preoperative RT alone, preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with a significantly higher R0 resection rate (84 versus 68 percent) and pathologic complete response rate (16 versus 7 percent), as well as better five-year rates of local control (82 versus 67 percent), failure-free survival (63 versus 44 percent), and cancer-specific survival (72 versus 55 percent).

However, as a group, patients treated for locally recurrent cancer (n = 25) had a worse outcome than did those with primary disease (five-year failure-free and overall survival 30 and 37 percent, respectively). Furthermore, these patients were more likely to be categorically unresectable following preoperative therapy.</p><p>Treatment intensification increases toxicity and may not improve outcomes. This was shown in a retrospective report of 102 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer after surgery alone who were treated with preoperative long-course RT (50.4 Gy) concurrent with FOLFOX given every two weeks for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Ninety-six completed chemoradiotherapy, of whom 75 went on to surgery (low anterior resection in 33, abdominal perineal resection in 23, Hartmann procedure in six, and pelvic exenteration in 13).

At a median follow-up of 19 months, tumor recurred locally in 49 (52 percent) and with distant metastases in 57 (61 percent). For the entire cohort, survival rates at one, two, and three years were 74, 56, and 36 percent, respectively. In multivariate analysis, factors that were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of survival were better performance status, lower American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage at recurrence, and higher hemoglobin levels during RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of intraoperative RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At many centers in the United States, Europe, and Asia, IORT has been used in conjunction with preoperative irradiation (with and without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>) and surgical resection when there is strong suspicion for gross residual cancer, positive resection margins, or the presence of tumor adherence to adjacent structures (eg, the pelvic sidewall or sacrum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/32,48,71-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,48,71-77</a>]. IORT is usually not given if at the time of surgery, there is no tumor adherence and adequate soft tissue radial margins are present (&gt;1 cm).</p><p>Although there are no randomized trials in which high-risk patients were randomized to receive or not receive IORT, favorable results are reported in series that utilize combined modality therapy that includes IORT administered at the time of surgical resection for locally recurrent disease; in most cases, IORT was preceded by external beam RT, usually with a concurrent fluoropyrimidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/20,32,48,77-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,32,48,77-82</a>]. The largest series was a pooled analysis of 565 patients treated for locally recurrent rectal cancer at one of two major treatment centers (one Dutch, one American); all but 12 received IORT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Overall, 251 (44 percent) had a radical (R0) resection, and the main factors related to the radicality of resection were preoperative treatment and a longer waiting time from the end of preoperative therapy to surgical resection with IORT. Radical resection was the most important factor influencing all oncologic outcomes. Overall survival rates at three and five years by extent of resection were R0 66 and 48 percent, R1 47 and 25 percent, and R2 37 and 17 percent, respectively.</p><p>An important point is that the use of IORT cannot compensate for incomplete resection in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/53,80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,80,83</a>]. This was illustrated in a series of 41 patients with locally recurrent rectal or rectosigmoid cancer who were treated with preoperative external beam RT, resection, and IORT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. At five years, the local control and survival rates for patients undergoing complete surgical resection were 47 and 21 percent, respectively, while the corresponding values for those undergoing only subtotal resection were 21 and 7 percent, despite the use of IORT in all patients. </p><p>Typical IORT doses are in the range of 10 to 20 Gy. The IORT dose is usually 10 to 12.5 Gy in patients undergoing complete resection with negative margins, 12.5 to 15 Gy in patients undergoing subtotal resection with microscopic residual, and 17.5 to 20 Gy in patients with macroscopic tumor after resection.</p><p>When IORT is used, it is critical for the surgeon and radiation oncologist to define all high-risk areas to determine the optimal position for the IORT field. To direct the IORT, cones are used with internal diameters ranging from 4 to 8 cm; cone size is selected to fully cover the high-risk area, generally on the sacrum or pelvic sidewall. The cone must abut the site being treated, which can be difficult if the high-risk area is located in an anatomically confined region such as the pelvis. Most IORT treatments in rectal cancer are given through the abdomen, but a perineal port is occasionally used to treat very low-lying tumor involving the coccyx, distal pelvic side wall, or portions of the prostate and bladder when an exenteration is not performed. IORT can also be delivered using high-dose-rate brachytherapy using a Harrison-Anderson-Mick (HAM) applicator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Previously irradiated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For previously irradiated patients, pelvic reirradiation is feasible in selected patients and may permit surgical salvage and long-term survival.

Pelvic reirradiation is feasible in selected cases and may permit surgical salvage and long-term survival.

Acute toxicities necessitated treatment interruption or termination in 22 percent of patients. Surgical resection of residual disease was undertaken in 34 patients, 14 of whom required pelvic exenteration, 11 an abdominal perineal resection, four a transanal transabdominal proctosigmoidectomy, two a full-thickness local excision, and three a Hartmann resection. The R0 resection rate was not reported. Although wound healing was slower, surgical morbidity was not dissimilar to historical control patients treated without preoperative RT, and there was no operative mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At a median two-year follow-up, the actuarial five-year survival rates were significantly higher for those undergoing surgery compared with reirradiation alone (22 versus 15 percent).

However, the single most important factor in predicting survival after radical surgery plus IORT for locally recurrent rectal cancer was a negative margin of resection. In the entire cohort, the actuarial five-year overall and cancer-specific survival rates were 32 and 39 percent, respectively, while among those with a R0 resection, the actuarial five-year overall and cancer-specific survival rates were 48 and 58 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Late complications were no more common in reirradiated patients than in previously unirradiated patients who underwent full-course preoperative chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery for recurrent disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term toxicity to normal tissues depends in part upon the size of each treatment fraction as well as the total radiation dose. Decreasing the size of each radiation fraction should permit higher total doses without increasing late morbidity. Hyperfractionation administers multiple daily treatments with smaller-than-conventional fraction sizes given over approximately the same treatment duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefits of hyperfractionated RT in the setting of potentially curative treatment for previously irradiated recurrent rectal cancer have been demonstrated in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/85,86,89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86,89-91</a>].

All patients with suspected locally recurrent rectal cancer should undergo a full clinical staging evaluation to exclude the presence of distant metastatic disease, including a computed tomography (CT) of the torso and an integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan. In addition to a digital clinical examination (which may require examination under anesthesia), a full colonoscopy, to evaluate the anastomotic site and assess the remainder of the large bowel for synchronous lesions, and rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommended. Gynecologic or cystoscopic evaluation may be needed for selected patients. In addition, serum levels of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be obtained.
