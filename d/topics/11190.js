Although tissue adhesives other than the cyanoacrylates are available, this discussion will primarily be limited to cyanoacrylate polymers, since they are most commonly used for minor laceration repair. Commercially available tissue adhesives primarily contain n-2-butyl- cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) or 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond, Surgiseal).</p><p>Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to permit normal healing of the underlying tissue.</p><p>The chemical composition, especially the length of the side chain, largely determines key properties of the tissue adhesive. Shorter side chains (eg, methyl-2-, ethyl-2-, or n-2-butyl-cyanoacrylate) form tight and stronger polymer bonds rapidly (within 15 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these bonds are more brittle resulting in a higher likelihood of wound dehiscence than longer side chain tissue adhesives.</p><p>Tissue adhesives with longer side chains (eg, 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate) form weaker bonds more slowly (approximately 30 seconds) but are less brittle with a lower risk of wound dehiscence than short chain adhesives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, the addition of plasticizers also permits the longer chain compounds to form a flexible, more adherent bond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Once applied, maximum bonding strength is achieved within 2.5 minutes of application. The tissue adhesives form a barrier to moisture and microbes over the wound with longer side chain adhesives taking longer to set [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The bonded adhesives spontaneously slough off within 5 to 10 days.</p><p>Compared with wounds closed with either absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application but equalizes by one week after repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/1-3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,6</a>].</p><p>Cyanoacrylates degrade into the toxic byproducts cyanoacetate and formaldehyde; these byproducts theoretically can cause an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissues that may compromise wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the rate of degradation in currently used cyanoacrylates (eg, n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate or 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate) is slow enough that the compound has sloughed off before any significant accumulation of toxic byproducts can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The table describes key aspects of wounds that affect the selection of a wound closure method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>We suggest that patients with short (&lt;5 cm) traumatic skin lacerations that are clean, have good wound approximation, and are under low wound tension, undergo repair with tissue adhesives rather than sutures. Wounds that meet all of these criteria are typically located on the face, especially the forehead. If n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) is used, then the length of the laceration should be &lt;4 cm to avoid wound dehiscence.</p><p>Clinical experience indicates that scalp wounds can also be closed with tissue adhesive, but the hair around the wound needs to be trimmed prior to closure. Adhesives are also helpful for closure of skin tears and flaps in patients with fragile skin that cannot be easily sutured (eg, elderly patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/2,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7</a>]. Tissue adhesives are frequently used for traumatic lacerations in athletes because they permit a more rapid return to competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. When wounds are under tension, placement of subcutaneous sutures can often reduce the tension sufficiently to permit the use of tissue adhesives for skin closure. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> below.)</p><p>This recommendation is based upon the following evidence regarding clinical outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a metaanalysis of 13 trials in children and adults with traumatic lacerations that were linear and under low tension, tissue adhesives were significantly less painful, quicker to apply (on average, 5 minutes faster), and produced similar cosmetic outcomes at 12 months than wounds repaired with sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tissue adhesives were associated with a small but significantly increased risk of wound dehiscence (risk difference 2 percent, number needed to harm: 40) although the clinical importance of this finding is unclear and the total number of wound dehiscences was small. Most traumatic lacerations undergoing repair in these studies were &lt;5 cm in length and were located on the face (eg, forehead).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study included in the analysis compared n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate in 94 children with facial lacerations &lt;4 cm in length and found no significant difference in cosmesis, pain, or difficulty in performing the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another study included in the analysis that compared low viscosity 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate with high viscosity 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate in 84 adults and children with small wounds (average length, 2 cm), high viscosity tissue adhesive was significantly less likely to migrate more than 1 cm from the wound margin than low viscosity adhesive but was associated with an increased sensation of warmth during repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequently, trials <strong>not</strong> included in this metaanalysis have shown the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an unblinded trial of 186 adults older than 18 years of age undergoing laceration repair in an emergency department, the use of tissue adhesive was associated with shorter closure time (9 versus 15 minutes, respectively) and higher patient satisfaction than suture repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cosmetic appearance, wound infection, and minor wound dehiscence were not significantly different regardless of closure technique. More sutured patients were discharged home with pain medication than those who had tissue adhesive closure (77 versus 60 percent, respectively) although pain at baseline and at follow up was not significantly different between the groups. Approximately 90 percent of wounds in both groups were located on the face or hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a small trial of 45 adults undergo reduction of an orbital floor fracture through a standardized lower eyelid incision 2.5 to 3 cm in length, wounds closed with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate healed with a statistically significant deeper margin at three months than those repaired with 6-0 nonabsorbable suture (median depth 0.3 versus 0.2 mm, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, cosmetic outcomes were not different in the two groups and no patient had wound dehiscence or infection. However, patients younger than 25 years who received tissue adhesives had statistically significantly worse cosmetic outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study of 216 patients with small lacerations (average length, 2 cm) on the face or upper extremities, high viscosity 2-octyl- cyanoacrylate alone achieved similar cosmetic appearance and no increased wound dehiscence when compared with mesh tape combined with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, combining mesh tape with tissue adhesives for closure of small wounds does not appear to have benefit over tissue adhesives alone for small wounds. However, this approach might permit the use of tissue adhesives for traumatic lacerations that are longer than 5 cm.</p><p/><p>The following information is available concerning the cost effectiveness of tissue adhesives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one economic analysis of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl, PeriAcryl) versus standard wound repair of facial lacerations in children, the use of absorbable sutures was 2.4 times more costly than tissue adhesives, while, because of the need for a repeat visit, nonabsorbable sutures were 6.8 times more costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of cost-effectiveness in Hong Kong, closure with 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate rather than suture repair was more costly to the health care facility (USD $28 versus $22, respectively) but resulted in a lower charge to the patient (USD $14 versus $20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, these studies indicate that tissue adhesives have the following advantages for repair of short, clean, straight, traumatic lacerations with low wound tension when compared with sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/2,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less painful procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More rapid repair time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of a waterproof and antimicrobial barrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better acceptance by patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No need for suture removal or follow-up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair</p><p/><p>Evidence suggests that wound dehiscence occurs more frequently with tissue adhesives but that the frequency of dehiscence in properly selected wounds is low (baseline frequency 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Whether the use of tissue adhesives is more or less costly than suture repair appears to depend upon the setting.</p><p>The use of tissue adhesives is also safer for the provider than sutures because needlesticks are avoided.</p><p>Tissue adhesives are not thought to prevent the formation of keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] but may promote less tissue reaction than sutures when performing closure of small lacerations in susceptible patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1863269\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue adhesives should <strong>not</strong> be used for the following wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/2,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds under tension, unless subcutaneous sutures can be placed to lessen tension and permit good wound approximation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex stellate lesions, crush wounds, or other lacerations with poor wound approximation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds on the hands, feet, or over joints unless the affected areas are immobilized, because repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces (eg, vagina) or areas of high moisture, such as the axillae and perineum.

However, tissue adhesives may be better than other options for wound closure in patients with poor wound healing, at least for small lacerations, because no foreign material is placed into the wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2415251\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the low pain of the procedure, we suggest children undergo minor wound repair with topical anesthetic on an as needed basis. Most children do well without any analgesia.</p><p>In a blinded trial of 203 children undergoing wound closure with tissue adhesives, patients who received LET for anesthesia reported significantly less pain and were more likely to report a pain-free procedure than children who received placebo (52 versus 28 percent, respectively, relative risk [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the amount of pain reported in both groups was low. Thus, if timing is an important factor, topical anesthesia may be omitted, especially in older patients.</p><p>Given the low pain of the procedure when analgesia is not used, we suggest that patients undergoing tissue adhesive closure of traumatic lacerations <strong>not</strong> receive injected local anesthetics for pain control rather than topical anesthesia or no anesthesia. In a blinded trial of 203 children undergoing wound closure with tissue adhesives, the median pain score for children who did <strong>not</strong> receive topical anesthesia was equivalent to minimal pain and the upper limit of the range was mild pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the pain of injection of local anesthesia, which is typically rated as moderate pain, is likely to be worse than the pain of closure with tissue adhesives without use of anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2415258\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds closed with tissue adhesives warrant thorough wound irrigation and cleansing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Because adhesives create an impermeable barrier over the wound, inadequate cleansing is associated with local infection and abscess formation.

Failure to strengthen such wounds with subcutaneous sutures may increase the risk of wound dehiscence and adversely affect the cosmetic result, since the adhesive typically peels off within 5 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Apply the butylcyanoacrylate glue directly from the tip or through a 25 gauge needle attached to the tip. The pattern should be in discrete drops along the wound margin and only a single application is required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90215\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90215 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Briefly remove the operator&rsquo;s hand (or forceps, if used) from the skin before the glue polymerizes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid touching the wound margin with the applicator while applying the glue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTERCARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds repaired by tissue adhesives do not require external bandages; the adhesive itself acts as a water-resistant bandage. Antibiotic ointment should not be used because it can break down the adhesive prematurely. The patient should receive tetanus prophylaxis as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Patients may shower while the adhesive is on the skin, but should not soak or scrub the area for 7 to 10 days. Wet skin should be gently patted dry. Children should not take baths if bathing would result in submersion of the affected area.</p><p>The adhesive will peel off when the epithelial layer sloughs off, usually by 5 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/1-3,5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,24</a>]. Antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly can be applied to the wound if the adhesive does not come off on its own.</p><p>Although no follow-up visit is required unless there are signs of infection or nonhealing, many physicians advise patients to return for wound evaluation in five to seven days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most complications of tissue adhesives relate to leakage onto unwanted areas although improper wound preparation or selection of wounds at risk of infection can lead to cellulitis or abscess.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6585613\"><span class=\"h2\">Excess leakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squeezing the vial too forcefully can result in adhesive draining away from the wound. This should be wiped off before it hardens. If the glue has set, it can be removed from adjacent skin by application of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment. Some authors recommend applying a protective periphery or &quot;wall&quot; of antibiotic ointment around the wound to prevent runoff and adhesion to adjacent structures. Gauze can also be used in the vicinity of the tissue adhesive to prevent adhesive runoff, but it should be moistened to decrease the probability of adherence to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Moistened gauze should be squeezed well, however, because it should not wet the skin where the adhesive is applied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6585574\"><span class=\"h2\">Gluing of gloves or instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Care should be taken to prevent leakage of the adhesive onto the glove or the forceps, because they can become glued to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>]. Alternating the hands or briefly removing the forceps from the skin before the adhesive hardens helps to prevent this problem. (See <a href=\"#H2563614\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p>If the wound is held together with fingers during repair, use of vinyl gloves helps reduce this complication because adhesion to vinyl gloves is substantially weaker than to rubber latex gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If adhesion occurs, mild tension is usually enough to separate the bond. If that fails, the glove can be removed and cut so that only a small piece of the glove remains attached to the patient.</p><p>Tissue adhesives also stick less well to metal than to plastic forceps. If the instrument becomes attached to the patient, application of antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly and gentle traction typically suffices for removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6585390\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eyes should be well protected during repair of adjacent lacerations. If adhesive gets into the eye, under the eyelid, or glues the eyelashes together, generous amounts of ophthalmic antibiotic ointment should be placed within the eye and on the eyelid to break down the adhesive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,26</a>]. Gentle manual traction typically permits reopening of eyelids that have been glued shut. If manual traction is unsuccessful, an ophthalmologist should be consulted. Once the eyelids are reopened, the patient should be assessed for a corneal abrasion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6585530\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound infections may result from inadequate cleansing of the wound or application of tissue adhesives to wounds with a high risk of infection (eg, puncture wounds, animal bites, or wounds in patients with comorbid conditions [eg, diabetes mellitus]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Periorbital cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis have been described. Clinicians should provide the same degree of meticulous wound cleansing and preparation for wounds undergoing closure with tissue adhesives as they would for wounds being repaired with sutures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1863269\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The currently used tissue adhesives include n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl or PeriAcryl) and 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond, or Surgiseal). Butylcyanoacrylates set more quickly than octylcyanoacrylates. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Properties of tissue adhesives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with short (&lt;5 cm) traumatic skin lacerations that are clean, have good wound approximation, and are under low wound tension undergo repair with tissue adhesives rather than sutures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Wounds that meet all of these criteria are typically located on the face, especially the forehead. If n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) is used then the length of the laceration should be &lt;4 cm to avoid wound dehiscence. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesives are also helpful for closure of skin tears and flaps in patients with fragile skin that cannot be easily sutured (eg, elderly patients). Tissue adhesives are frequently used for traumatic lacerations in athletes because they permit a more rapid return to competition. When wounds are under tension, placement of subcutaneous sutures can often reduce the tension sufficiently to permit the use of tissue adhesives for skin closure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue adhesives are <strong>not</strong> recommended for the following wounds (see <a href=\"#H1863269\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wounds under tension, unless deep sutures are placed to permit wound approximation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, unless immobilized</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex stellate lesions, crush wounds, or other lacerations with poor wound approximation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces (eg, vagina) or areas of high moisture such as the axillae and perineum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wounds in hairy areas unless the hair is trimmed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wounds requiring a high level of precision (eg, hairline or vermilion border)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bite wounds and other wounds at increased risk of infection (eg, puncture wounds, wounds with devitalized or contaminated tissue) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;, section on 'Primary closure'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wounds in patients with allergy to adhesives (or formaldehyde), bleeding disorders, or comorbid conditions that delay or prevent proper healing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children do well without any analgesia. Given the low levels of pain from wound closure with adhesives, we suggest that patients undergoing tissue adhesive closure of traumatic lacerations <strong>not</strong> receive injected local anesthetics for pain control rather than topical anesthesia or no anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2415251\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds closed with tissue adhesives warrant thorough wound irrigation and cleansing. Because adhesives create an impermeable barrier over the wound, inadequate cleansing is associated with local infection and abscess formation. A wall of antibiotic ointment or damp gauze may be placed around the laceration to prevent excess glue leakage around the wound. (See <a href=\"#H2415258\" class=\"local\">'Wound preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be positioned so that the wound is horizontal or tilted away from adjacent structures (eg, the eyes) to minimize leakage of the adhesive. (See <a href=\"#H2415265\" class=\"local\">'Patient positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The techniques for applying tissue adhesives (2-octyl-cyanoacrylate or n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylates) to superficial skin lacerations are described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82996 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90215\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90215 \">figure 2</a>).

The adhesive itself acts as a water-resistant bandage. Antibiotic ointment should not be used as it can break down the adhesive prematurely. The adhesive will peel off when the epithelial layer sloughs off, usually by 5 to 10 days. Antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly can be applied to the wound if the adhesive does not come off on its own. No follow-up visit is required unless there are signs of infection or nonhealing.
