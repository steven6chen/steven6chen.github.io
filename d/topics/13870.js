In other cases, poor weight gain is related to increased metabolic requirements secondary to an underlying disease state, or a combination of these factors. The challenge for the child's clinician is to determine if inadequate dietary intake is the result of an underlying medical problem (organic disease), environmental or psychosocial problems, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>This topic will discuss the etiology and approach to poor weight gain in children older than two years. Poor weight gain in children younger than two years and short stature are discussed separately.

However, the precise frequency is unknown, since poor weight gain may be both over- and underdiagnosed. The parents' level of concern regarding their child's weight gain may reflect expectations based upon the parents' recollections of their own patterns of growth, whereas clinicians may have limited concerns about a child's gradual decline or slow gain in weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary cause of poor weight gain in preschool and school-age children and adolescents is inadequate dietary intake relative to typical metabolic and growth needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The etiology of inadequate dietary intake often is mixed; underlying medical conditions and environmental or psychosocial problems play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Involuntary weight loss typically implies an underlying medical problem, whereas slow weight gain is more often related to social <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental factors. However, there are exceptions (eg, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often presents with slow weight gain rather than weight loss).

When inadequate intake is related to an underlying medical condition, the gastrointestinal, cardiac, and renal systems are those most commonly involved (in decreasing order of frequency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited or inappropriate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited or inappropriate intake of food can be involuntary or deliberate.

The energy cost of growth often is underestimated. Coupled with poor dietary intake, the energy cost of growth further aggravates progressive deficits in body weight prior to linear growth arrest. The daily energy cost of growth averages 5 kilocalories per gram of tissue accreted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The conceptual framework for the diagnostic approach to poor weight gain depends upon the practice pattern of the clinician. The primary care clinician frequently searches for common problems that have less severe presentations, whereas the specialist seeks to diagnose or exclude uncommon disorders that have significant medical consequences.</p><p>In either case, the usual approach is to identify the major symptoms, consider the most common categories of disease possibilities, conduct a thorough physical examination, screen for possible disease entities, begin an empiric treatment regimen, and monitor the clinical response. The pace of the evaluation should be individualized and tailored to the severity of the problem.</p><p>Obtaining accurate serial weight and height measurements using appropriate measuring devices is essential to establish the validity and pattern of poor weight gain. In general, inadequate caloric intake affects weight gain first, then height velocity and height percentiles. It is generally necessary to monitor weight and height for at least six months before concluding that a patient has met the definition of poor weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p>During this period, the primary care clinician may rely on simple interventional strategies (eg, nutritional counseling and dietary intervention) or systematically perform a series of diagnostic tests to help determine whether the child has an underlying medical problem in addition to contributing psychosocial or environmental factors. The primary care clinician may refer the child to the specialist when advanced diagnostic studies are required.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary cause of poor weight gain in preschool and school-age children and adolescents is inadequate dietary intake relative to typical metabolic and growth needs, which may be related to underlying medical, environmental, or social problems, alone or in combination. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach typically involves performing a complete history and physical examination to identify the major symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57170 \">table 1</a>) and etiologic categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68318 \">table 2</a>), screening for possible disease entities, initiating an empiric treatment regimen, and monitoring the clinical response.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important aspects of the physical examination are the growth measurements and the growth pattern.
