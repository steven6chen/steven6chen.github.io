The lesion may be found either without an identifiable cause (in which case it is called &quot;idiopathic&quot; or &quot;primary&quot;) or in response to previous glomerular injury, glomerular hypertension or hypertrophy, or to genetic defects, viral infections, or medications (&quot;secondary&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. FSGS is distinct from focal and global glomerulosclerosis, which has a different prognosis and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Primary FSGS can present acutely with overt nephrotic syndrome characterized by hypoalbuminemia and edema. However, primary FSGS can also present insidiously with less dramatic manifestations, possibly related to the underlying histologic variant. The diagnosis of primary FSGS is confirmed by a renal biopsy that reveals the morphologic features mentioned above as well as, in most cases, diffuse (greater than 80 percent) effacement of the foot processes by electron microscopy. By contrast, secondary FSGS most often presents as asymptomatic proteinuria without profound hypoalbuminemia or edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the kidney biopsy usually reveals glomerulomegaly, focal (rather than diffuse) foot process effacement, and, sometimes, evidence of a separate kidney disease that is responsible for the development of secondary FSGS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing between <strong>primary and secondary disease</strong> is particularly important because of the markedly different approach to therapy in the two disorders. Primary FSGS is often responsive to immunosuppressive therapy, including glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and other immunosuppressive agents. By contrast, immunosuppression is not indicated in secondary FSGS.</p><p>Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) reduces proteinuria and slows progression in proteinuric kidney diseases. However, whether or not this is effective in primary FSGS is unknown.</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of primary FSGS in adults, focusing on patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. The causes of FSGS and the treatment of children with FSGS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion does <strong>not</strong> apply to collapsing FSGS, which may be associated with HIV and a variety of other conditions. That variant is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not associated with HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential efficacy of therapy must be considered in relation to the natural history of the disease. Untreated primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) often follows a progressive course to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The rate of spontaneous complete remission among patients with nephrotic syndrome is unknown but is probably less than 10 percent. Spontaneous remission is more likely to occur among patients with normal kidney function and non-nephrotic proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Previously, treatment was not considered to substantially improve the prognosis of FSGS. However, longer courses of treatment have resulted in response rates of up to 70 percent and improved overall prognosis. Whether the outcome of patients who present with a substantial reduction in kidney function can be altered is less clear. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that appear to influence response to treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognosis principally include the degrees of proteinuria and renal dysfunction as well as the histologic findings. The most reliable prognostic indicator remains the patient's response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Degree of proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria &ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and low plasma albumin concentration) have five-year renal survival rates of 60 to 90 percent, and 10-year renal survival rates of 30 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Massive proteinuria (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> when unresponsive to treatment, is associated with an even worse prognosis, with most patients progressing to ESRD within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By contrast, renal survival is much better in patients without nephrotic syndrome, especially when this is associated with normal renal function (over 85 percent renal survival at 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, these observations could reflect the underlying mechanism of disease (eg, primary versus secondary FSGS). </p><p>The rate of spontaneous complete remission among patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria is unknown since most patients are treated. It is probably less than 10 percent; slightly higher spontaneous remission rates in some reports may reflect more widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Severity of renal dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More severe renal dysfunction at presentation is generally associated with worse renal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In one series, for example, patients with a plasma creatinine concentration of greater than 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (115 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> had a significantly decreased 10-year renal survival (27 versus 100 percent for those with a lower plasma creatinine) that was independent of the degree of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Worse renal function at presentation (unless it is acute) is generally associated with a greater extent of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis on biopsy (reflecting more severe disease, disease of longer duration, or other factors such as hypertension or aging); therefore, it is less likely to respond to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Histologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of interstitial fibrosis at the time of presentation uniformly predicts poor renal survival, although this may reflect secondary FSGS in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/6,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-16</a>]. The collapsing variant is particularly associated with a worse prognosis and is often considered a different disorder.</p><p>The association of other histologic variants with severity at presentation (ie, presence or absence of nephrotic syndrome) and prognosis is less clear. Patients with segmental scarring at the tubular pole of the glomeruli, the so-called &quot;glomerular tip lesion&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66716\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66716 \">picture 1</a>), have been considered more likely to respond to steroid therapy or to spontaneously remit (if renal function is normal). However, the presence of this lesion does not guarantee responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/3,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16-19</a>]. The prognostic relevance of histologic variants is discussed elsewhere.</p><p>Interestingly, focal &quot;global&quot; sclerosis (eg, lesions that involve most or all of the glomerular tuft, not just segments) was associated with steroid responsiveness in a small study of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One possible explanation is that these patients actually had minimal change disease, and the totally sclerotic glomeruli reflected prior damage. It is unclear whether similar lesions in adult populations predict response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Identification of steroid dependence and steroid resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strongest prognostic indicator of renal survival is the initial response of the proteinuria to therapy, regardless of the type of histology. Response is reported in terms of degree of reduction in proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4,12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,21,22</a>]. We propose the following definitions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete response is a reduction in proteinuria to &lt;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A partial response in patients presenting with nephrotic-range proteinuria is a reduction of &ge;50 percent, and to less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relapse is a return of proteinuria to &ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in someone who had undergone a complete or partial remission</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid dependence refers to relapse while on therapy or requirement for continuation of steroids to maintain remission</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid resistance refers to little or no reduction in proteinuria after 12 to 16 weeks of adequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy in an adult, or to patients who have some reduction in proteinuria with more prolonged therapy who do not meet the criteria for partial remission</p><p/><p>Patients who undergo partial or complete remission have a much better chance of renal survival (approximately 80 versus &lt;50 percent at 10 years in nonresponders and untreated patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4,5,8,10,12,15,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8,10,12,15,17,23</a>]. Some investigators also include normalization of the plasma albumin concentration in the definition of response. </p><p>General outcomes with respect to response to therapy, including the prognosis associated with partial remissions and relapses, were perhaps best shown in a retrospective study of 281 FSGS patients with the nephrotic syndrome who were followed for a minimum of one year in the Toronto Glomerulonephritis Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Two-thirds of the patients received immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose glucocorticoids (50 percent), cytotoxic agents (19 percent), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (12 percent). Over one-half of patients also received an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).</p><p>At a median follow-up of 64 months, a complete, partial, or no remission was observed in 20, 41, and 39 percent, respectively. The time to remission was 12 to 14 months. Relapses occurred less frequently in those who had a complete remission (36 versus 52 percent among partial responders). Renal failure occurred in 6, 18, and 45 percent of patients with a complete, partial, or no remission, respectively. Patients who remained in remission had a slower rate of decline in renal function and a lower risk of renal failure compared with those who experienced a later relapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease progression, either by worsening renal function or, in some studies, histologic parameters, may occur despite partial remission of proteinuria. Some patients have a modest increase in the plasma creatinine concentration and, on repeat renal biopsy, an increased number of glomeruli with segmental or global sclerosis and more severe tubulointerstitial disease. This may be, in part, due to bias in the selection of patients for repeat biopsy and due to tissue sampling bias given the focal nature of the disease. However, it may also reflect a low level of continued disease activity, healing of previous injury, or secondary hemodynamic damage (which may be minimized by administration of an ACE inhibitor or ARB). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although less responsive than minimal change disease, primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) often responds to glucocorticoids, as well as other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; however, more prolonged glucocorticoid therapy than in minimal change disease is generally required to induce remission.</p><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have not been specifically studied in primary FSGS. However, these drugs reduce proteinuria and may slow progression in proteinuric kidney diseases and should therefore be considered in patients with primary FSGS whether or not immunosuppressive therapy is provided. In addition, patients with nephrotic syndrome are often hypercholesterolemic and might benefit from statin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>These recommendations do not apply to collapsing FSGS, the treatment of which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not associated with HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84733811\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment suggestions outlined below, and discussed later in detail, are based upon <strong>low- or moderate-quality data</strong> (eg, personal experience, observational studies, and small trials). There are no available high-quality data to guide treatment recommendations.</p><p>Patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who have nephrotic syndrome are usually offered disease-modifying therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally provide such treatment to patients with primary FSGS who present with nephrotic syndrome (ie, proteinuria &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> accompanied by hypoalbuminemia &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [&lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span>. Such patients have a poor prognosis without disease-modifying therapy. The majority of patients with primary FSGS present with nephrotic syndrome and a biopsy showing diffuse foot process effacement, or else develop nephrotic syndrome soon after biopsy. However, some patients with nephrotic syndrome at presentation receive glucocorticoids for variable periods of time before a kidney biopsy is performed. In such patients, the clinical status may improve, and histologic evidence of diffuse foot process effacement may be lacking. However, immunosuppressive therapy should be offered to these patients if the clinician suspects that a biopsy performed at the initial presentation would have revealed typical features of primary FSGS. Rare patients may present with histologic evidence of primary FSGS but without nephrotic syndrome; such patients should also receive glucocorticoid therapy if they progress to develop nephrotic syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do <strong>not</strong> usually initiate glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs in patients who do not have nephrotic syndrome. Patients without nephrotic syndrome who have normal kidney function typically have indolent disease that either spontaneously remits or remains stable for years. Patients without nephrotic syndrome who have decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may have secondary FSGS or else previously severe primary FSGS that went undiagnosed; such patients respond poorly to immunosuppressive therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, we do <strong>not</strong> usually initiate such treatment in patients with histologic evidence of extensive glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, as these findings are manifestations of irreversible damage, particularly in patients with substantially reduced kidney function. Glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs are unlikely to be beneficial in this setting.</p><p/><p>If disease-modifying therapy is used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Previously untreated patients</strong> &ndash; In previously untreated patients, we usually use oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) for at least 8 to 16 weeks as initial immunosuppressive therapy. Alternatively, calcineurin inhibitors with or without low-dose glucocorticoids for approximately 12 months can be used in patients who have a high risk for glucocorticoid-induced toxicity (eg, obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients &gt;70 years of age). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late relapse after remission</strong> &ndash; In patients who relapse more than two months after achieving a complete or partial remission with an initial course of glucocorticoid therapy, and who did not develop significant toxicity from the glucocorticoids, we usually repeat the course of glucocorticoids. However, in such patients who developed significant side effects from glucocorticoids, or who are at high risk for such complications, we treat with calcineurin inhibitors with or without low-dose glucocorticoids for approximately 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of late relapsing disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant</strong> &ndash; In patients who either relapse while glucocorticoids are being tapered or within two months after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy (ie, &quot;steroid-dependent FSGS&quot;), and in patients who fail to achieve any remission with glucocorticoid therapy (complete or partial, and without resolution of nephrotic syndrome, called &quot;steroid-resistant FSGS&quot;), we usually treat with calcineurin inhibitors with or without low-dose glucocorticoids. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) combined with glucocorticoids may be beneficial in those who have failed or cannot take calcineurin inhibitors. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> may also be effective in patients with steroid-dependent but not steroid-resistant FSGS. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The goal of therapy in primary FSGS is remission of proteinuria, preferably complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4,12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,21,22</a>]. We use the following definitions of complete and partial remission, based upon two consecutive urine collections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete remission is a reduction in proteinuria to &lt;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A partial remission can be defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in proteinuria to a level that is &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span></p><p/><p>Regardless of whether or not immunosuppressive therapy is provided, we treat hypertensive patients with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, and we treat hyperlipidemic patients with a statin.

Such patients who have decreased kidney function may have had more severe proteinuria at an earlier stage of their disease that went undetected, or they may have secondary FSGS.

Universal agreement about the duration of prednisone therapy is lacking and should be guided by the clinical response and tolerability. Prednisone dosing and duration and monitoring the response to therapy are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prednisone dose'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Duration and monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternatively, in patients who have a high risk for glucocorticoid-induced toxicity (eg, obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients &gt;70 years of age), a 12-month course of a calcineurin inhibitor can be used, with or without low-dose glucocorticoids. However, we avoid using calcineurin inhibitors in patients who have significantly reduced kidney function (estimated GFR [eGFR] &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) because of the potential nephrotoxicity of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Calcineurin inhibitors as alternative initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recommendations for initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> are based upon observational studies and the authors' clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. There are no randomized trials comparing prednisone or other agents with placebo for <strong>initial</strong> therapy of primary FSGS (existing trials have evaluated treatment of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS). Prednisone induces complete or partial remission in 40 to 80 percent of patients with relatively preserved renal function, and, as noted above, responders have better long-term outcomes.

An alternative is to use 120 mg of prednisone every other day for two months with subsequent tapering of the dose. Depending upon the response to and the toxicity from this therapy, the duration of prednisone therapy can vary from as short as 8 to 12 weeks to as long as one year (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Duration and monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy'</a> below).

As a result, such patients should receive a trial of glucocorticoids, unless they are at markedly increased risk of glucocorticoid-induced toxicity, have extensive glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, or have a substantial reduction in eGFR. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Factors that appear to be associated with a lower likelihood of response to glucocorticoids include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant tubulointerstitial disease on renal biopsy (which may reflect secondary FSGS in some cases) and an elevated plasma creatinine concentration predict a lower likelihood of response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/4,5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,15</a>]. The prognostic importance of tubular disease is suggested from the apparent relation between tubular function (as estimated from the rate of excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins, such as beta-2 microglobulin and retinol-binding protein) and the response to therapy. These smaller proteins are normally filtered and then almost entirely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Thus, increased excretion in FSGS reflects tubular dysfunction rather than enhanced glomerular permeability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, in a report of 37 adults with the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (many of whom had FSGS), those who had little or no low-molecular-weight proteinuria all went into remission with a 12-week course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. By comparison, increasing degrees of low-molecular-weight proteinuria carried an increasing likelihood of steroid resistance. Unfortunately, these measurements are not routinely available.

In addition to familial disease, mutations in the gene (NPHS2) for at least one of these proteins, podocin, have been described in approximately 25 percent of cases of apparently sporadic steroid-resistant FSGS in children from Europe and the Middle East.

One study has suggested that expression of a specific variant of NPHS2 is associated with steroid-resistant, adult-onset FSGS among patients from Europe or South America. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the frequency of these abnormalities in nephrotic adults who do not also have family members with FSGS is very low, and we do not test routinely for such mutations. In addition, some patients with FSGS who have these known mutations associated with FSGS have responded to treatment with either glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors, suggesting that, in these circumstances, such therapy should be attempted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional genetic as well as socioeconomic factors may contribute to treatment resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As an example, the significantly lower response to therapy among African Americans compared with Caucasians may be due to a variety of factors, including a higher frequency of the collapsing variant, a higher incidence and severity of hypertension, a greater likelihood of presenting with significant fibrosis on biopsy, certain genetic variants, and possible effects of socioeconomic status on adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcineurin inhibitors as alternative initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients at increased risk for glucocorticoid-associated toxicity (eg, obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients &gt;70 years of age), we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> with or without low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> as initial therapy, although data evaluating this strategy are limited. We avoid using calcineurin inhibitors in patients who have significant vascular or interstitial disease on renal biopsy, or a chronic reduction in kidney function with an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, because of the nephrotoxicity of these drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nephrotoxicity is of concern in the usage of calcineurin inhibitors in treatment of steroid-resistant FSGS with chronically impaired renal function. In our opinion, such agents should be avoided in subjects with an eGFR of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (stage 4 chronic kidney disease). If the renal biopsy shows little or minor interstitial fibrosis and extensive interstitial edema, then these agents can be used cautiously in subjects with clinically severe nephrotic syndrome and eGFR of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2 </sup>at starting doses that are one-half of those usually recommended for subjects with normal renal function. Serum creatinine (and eGFR) should be assessed by one week after starting the drug, and if the values are stable or improving, then the dose can be gradually uptitrated to therapeutic levels depending upon the results of weekly monitoring. If serum creatinine shows a persistent and progressive increase during treatment despite lower-than-normal calcineurin inhibitor doses or levels, then it may be necessary to abandon this approach to treatment altogether and move to alternative regimens.

However, this study has important limitations that hinder its interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. First, the number of enrolled subjects was smaller than anticipated; whereas the trial was designed to include 500, only 138 patients were actually randomized. As a result, the trial may have been underpowered to detect clinically significant benefits associated with cyclosporine. </p><p>Another limitation is that the inclusion criteria allowed patients to be defined as glucocorticoid resistant after only four weeks of glucocorticoid therapy. This may have resulted in an overestimate of the benefit of immunosuppressive therapy since many patients (especially adults) respond to glucocorticoids after 8 to 12 weeks. The trial also included patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria who generally have a good prognosis and, in practice, would not be considered for immunosuppressive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Degree of proteinuria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.) </p><p>The permissive eligibility criteria (among the criteria for trial entry was protein excretion &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> as estimated by the protein-to-creatinine ratio) and the lack of electron microscopy data may also have allowed the inclusion of patients with secondary FSGS. This is in contrast to most studies where patients labeled as having primary FSGS have nephrotic-range proteinuria and patients with presumed secondary FSGS have lower levels of protein excretion. The inclusion of patients with secondary FSGS could have potentially lowered the overall response rate that was observed in this trial since such patients generally do not respond to immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p>Some smaller observational studies have suggested a possible benefit of MMF given with or without glucocorticoids:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective single-center study, 18 patients were treated with MMF because of steroid resistance or steroid dependence with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> (with or without glucocorticoids), given at variable doses for periods of 4 to 24 months, resulted in complete and partial remission of proteinuria in two and six patients, respectively.

If albumin leakage is increased because of the presence of a permeability factor, the volume of the rat glomeruli is reduced due to concurrent water transfer.</p><p>In one report, two patients with a positive GVV-test responded to plasma immunoadsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]; after therapy, no evidence of a circulating permeability factor was found in either individual. However, when measured serially in another study, the levels of the permeability factor in patients with primary FSGS were lower than previously reported for patients with recurrent post-transplant FSGS, were not related to severity of disease, and did not decrease despite clinical response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>The accurate assessment of the role of plasmapheresis and the GVV-test in the management of patients with FSGS requires further evaluation.

The lesion may be found either without an identifiable cause (in which case it is called &quot;idiopathic&quot; or &quot;primary&quot;) or in response to previous glomerular injury, glomerular hypertension or hypertrophy, or to genetic defects, viruses, or medications (&quot;secondary&quot;). Distinguishing between primary and secondary disease is particularly important because of the markedly different approach to therapy in the two disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated primary FSGS often follows a progressive course to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The rate of spontaneous complete remission among patients with nephrotic syndrome is unknown but is probably less than 10 percent. Spontaneous remission is more likely to occur among patients with normal kidney function and proteinuria &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. Factors that appear to influence response to treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognosis principally include the degree and duration of proteinuria, a substantial chronic reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and certain histologic findings (principally, the degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis). The most reliable prognostic indicator remains the patient's response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who have nephrotic syndrome are usually offered disease-modifying therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs (see <a href=\"#H84733811\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids as initial therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who present with nephrotic syndrome (ie, proteinuria &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> accompanied by hypoalbuminemia &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [&lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L]),</span> we recommend treating with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs rather than treating only with nonimmunosuppressive therapy or observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This treatment recommendation may also apply to those patients with nephrotic syndrome at presentation but who receive glucocorticoids for variable periods of time before a kidney biopsy is performed. In such patients, the clinical status may improve, and histologic evidence of diffuse foot process effacement may be lacking. However, immunosuppressive therapy should be offered to such patients if the clinician suspects that a biopsy performed at the initial presentation would have revealed typical features of primary FSGS. In addition, rare patients may present with histologic evidence of primary FSGS but without nephrotic syndrome; such patients should also receive glucocorticoid therapy if they subsequently progress to develop nephrotic syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, we do <strong>not</strong> usually initiate glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs in patients who do not have nephrotic syndrome. Patients without nephrotic syndrome who have normal kidney function typically have indolent disease that either spontaneously remits or remains stable for years. Patients without nephrotic syndrome who have decreased GFR may have secondary FSGS or else previously severe primary FSGS that went undiagnosed; such patients respond poorly to immunosuppressive therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition, we do <strong>not</strong> usually initiate such treatment in patients with histologic evidence of extensive glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, as these findings are manifestations of irreversible damage, particularly in patients with substantially reduced kidney function. Glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs are unlikely to be beneficial in this setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients treated with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs, the goal of therapy is remission of proteinuria, preferably complete remission. We use the following definitions of complete and partial remission, based upon two consecutive urine collections:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A complete remission is a reduction in proteinuria to &lt;200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A partial remission can be defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in proteinuria to a level that is &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If immunosuppressive drugs are used, choice of therapy differs according to the following (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Previously untreated patients</strong> &ndash; In previously untreated patients who are not at high risk for glucocorticoid-induced toxicity (eg, patients without obesity, diabetes, severe osteoporosis, and who are younger than 70 years), we suggest oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) as initial immunosuppressive treatment rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids as initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Dosing, duration, and monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prednisone dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Duration and monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Alternatively, in previously untreated patients who are at high risk for glucocorticoid-induced toxicity, we suggest calcineurin inhibitor therapy (cyclosporin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), with or without low-dose glucocorticoids, rather than other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some but not all experts use low-dose glucocorticoid therapy in combination with calcineurin inhibitors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Dosing, duration, and monitoring of calcineurin inhibitor therapy (and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy, if used) are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H276442105\" class=\"local\">'Calcineurin inhibitor dosing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H276441895\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and duration of calcineurin inhibitor therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Late relapse after remission</strong> &ndash; In patients who relapse more than two months after achieving a complete or partial remission with an initial course of glucocorticoid therapy, and who did not develop significant toxicity from the glucocorticoids, we suggest repeating the course of glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, in such patients who developed significant side effects from glucocorticoids, or who are at high risk for such complications, we suggest treatment using calcineurin inhibitors, with or without low-dose glucocorticoids, rather than high-dose glucocorticoids or other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of late relapsing disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant</strong> &ndash; Patients who will respond to glucocorticoids generally start to show some reduction in protein excretion within the first 8 to 12 weeks of therapy. Patients who attain a remission but who relapse while still on therapy, while therapy is being tapered, or within two months of discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy are considered <strong>steroid dependent</strong>. Patients with little or no reduction in protein excretion at 12 to 16 weeks are considered <strong>steroid resistant</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Identification of steroid dependence and steroid resistance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS'</a> above.)<br/><br/>In patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS, we suggest treatment with calcineurin inhibitors, with or without low-dose glucocorticoids, rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Dosing, duration, and monitoring are the same as when these drugs are used as initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H276441983\" class=\"local\">'Calcineurin inhibitors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid using calcineurin inhibitors in patients who have advanced vascular or interstitial disease on renal biopsy, or an estimated GFR (eGFR) &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, because of the nephrotoxicity associated with these drugs. In addition, patients may fail therapy with these drugs or else develop severe side effects unrelated to nephrotoxicity. Thus, in patients who cannot receive calcineurin inhibitor therapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), with or without low-dose glucocorticoids, rather than other agents or nonimmunosuppressive therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

This therapy can be used even in patients who are not hypertensive, although care must be taken in these cases to avoid inducing symptomatic low blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other disease-modifying therapies have been studied in patients with primary FSGS but should not typically be used unless attempts with glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, or MMF have failed, or if the patient has repeatedly relapsed despite the use of such treatments. These alternative therapies include cytotoxic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), plasmapheresis, costimulatory inhibition, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis.
