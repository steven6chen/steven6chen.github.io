Compared with historical controls (untreated or treated for one month), combination treatment for 12 months was associated with improved neurologic, cognitive, and auditory outcomes at follow-up (average age 10.5 years) and prevention of new eye lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-toxoplasmosis-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Signs of active infection resolved within weeks in all treated infants who were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-toxoplasmosis-treatment-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among infants with no or mild disease at birth, all had normal cognitive, neurologic, and auditory outcomes; only 9 percent developed new eye lesions. Among infants who had moderate or severe neurologic disease at birth, 72 percent had normal neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive outcomes; none had hearing loss; only 36 percent developed new eye lesions; but 85 percent had impaired vision (most infants with impaired vision had retinal disease at birth). There were 11 deaths (mortality of 9 percent); 9 of 11 deaths occurred in children with severe central nervous system disabilities.</p><p>The patient population of the NCCCTS was heterogeneous and symptomatic.

Although they did not have apparent disease at birth, further evaluation after being identified by serologic screening showed some combination of elevation of CSF protein, intracranial calcifications, or retinal lesions in 40 percent of the infants. Most of the infants were treated for one year (one infant died of a viral infection at two months of age; the parents of four discontinued treatment after six to eight months), but the regimens varied at the discretion of the infectious disease consultant; 40 of the 49 infants had the same regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pyrimethamine</a> daily for six months followed by pyrimethamine every other day for six months, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sulfadiazine</a> twice daily for 12 months, and folinic acid thrice weekly to daily (adjusted for hematologic changes). After treatment, only one child had a neurologic deficit (hemiplegia that was attributed to a cerebral lesion present at birth). Among the 39 children who had ophthalmologic follow-up at one to six years of age, four had lesions that may have developed postnatally.
