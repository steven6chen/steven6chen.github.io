The diagnosis and prompt management of potentially life-threatening hemorrhage is the primary goal. The preservation of functional splenic tissue is secondary and in selected patients may be accomplished using nonoperative management or operative salvage techniques. Any attempt to salvage the spleen is abandoned in the face of ongoing hemorrhage or other life-threatening injuries. Emergent and urgent splenectomy remains a life-saving measure for many patients.</p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnosis and management of splenic injury. The management of spontaneous splenic rupture related to infectious or hematologic diseases as opposed to injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Splenic rupture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLENIC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen is located posterolaterally in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen beneath the left hemidiaphragm and lateral to the greater curvature of the stomach. The gross anatomy of the spleen is described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Anatomy of the spleen'</a>.)</p><p>The spleen is a major lymphopoietic organ, comprising approximately 25 percent of the total lymphoid mass of the body. Normal splenic function is important for opsonization of encapsulated organisms. Splenic physiology is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Normal splenic function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic injury most commonly occurs following blunt trauma due to motor vehicle collisions (driver, passenger, or pedestrian). However, blunt splenic injury can also result from falls, sport-related activities, or assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Penetrating splenic trauma is less common than blunt injury and is typically due to assault, but inadvertent impalement may also occur. Assault with a knife compared with gunshot or shotgun wounds is less likely to result in penetrating injury due to the spleen's protected location.</p><p>Iatrogenic traumatic injuries to the spleen can result from surgical or endoscopic manipulation of the colon, stomach, pancreas, kidney, or with exposure and reconstruction of the proximal abdominal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Most commonly, the primary mechanism is capsular tear, laceration from retraction devices, or tension on the spleen during manipulation of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk is greatest for patients undergoing colon resection. A study from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database found, among nearly a million patients, a 1 percent incidence of splenic injury during colorectal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Transverse colectomy was the colon procedure most commonly associated with splenic injury. Other factors related to iatrogenic splenic injury include prior surgery, obesity, malignancy, diverticulitis, and peripheral artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation and management of the trauma patient with blunt or penetrating trauma based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The spleen and liver are the most commonly injured intra-abdominal organs following blunt trauma. In up to 60 percent of patients, the spleen is the only organ injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Specific elements of the history, physical examination and diagnostic evaluation pertaining to splenic injury are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of trauma to the left-upper quadrant, left rib cage, or left flank should increase the suspicion for splenic injury. However, a negative history does not reliably exclude splenic injury. A penetrating object can injure the spleen even if the entrance wound is not in proximity to the spleen.</p><p>The patient may complain of left upper abdominal, left chest wall, or left shoulder pain (ie, Kehr's sign). Kehr's sign is pain referred to the left shoulder that worsens with inspiration and is due to irritation of the phrenic nerve from blood adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm.</p><p>Abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs are the most common findings indicative of intra-abdominal injury; however, these are not sensitive or specific for splenic injury. Physical findings associated with splenic injury include left-upper quadrant or generalized abdominal tenderness, abdominal wall contusion or hematoma (eg, seat belt sign), as well as left lower chest wall tenderness, contusion, or instability due to rib fractures. However, an unremarkable physical examination does not exclude splenic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the setting of injury, many patients have altered mental status (eg, neurologic injury, intoxication) or are intubated and sedated and cannot relate their symptoms or medical history. Every attempt should be made to identify any preexisting medical conditions by contacting the patient's primary care physician or family members. The presence of significant medical comorbidities and medical conditions requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications needs to be determined as these may impact management decisions. A social history should be obtained to determine the feasibility of nonoperative management of splenic injury, if warranted. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to nonoperative management'</a> below.) </p><p>A history of herbal medicine use is also important as some (eg, ginkgo biloba, saw palmetto, fish oil) have anticoagulant activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'Surgical patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'Herb-drug interactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With blunt abdominal trauma, lower rib fractures, pelvic fracture, and spinal cord injury may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hollow viscous injuries are estimated to occur in 3 percent of patients with blunt splenic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the presence of rib fractures increases the likelihood of splenic injury, there is no association between the number of ribs fractured and splenic injury severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The injuries associated with penetrating trauma depend upon the type of implement or missile used and its trajectory. Injuries to adjacent organs including the heart, esophagus, aorta, stomach, diaphragm, pancreas, bowel, or left kidney can occur in conjunction with splenic laceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the abdominal trauma patient commonly uses focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST exam) and computed tomography (CT). The FAST exam is more useful in hemodynamically unstable patients; however, a negative FAST examination is not adequate to exclude splenic injury, particularly intraparenchymal injury. The use of diagnostic peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/lavage</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(DPA/DPL)</span> is less common, having been largely replaced by the FAST examination in most major trauma centers. The value of these tests in the initial evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma is discussed in detail elsewhere. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Specific diagnostic findings of splenic injury are described in the sections below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2380934350\"><span class=\"h3\">FAST findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs of splenic injury observed with FAST examination include a finding of hypoechoic (ie, black) rim around the spleen, which may represent subcapsular fluid or intraperitoneal perisplenic fluid, or fluid in Morrison&rsquo;s pouch (hepatorenal space). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2380934357\"><span class=\"h3\">CT findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In noninjured patients, CT scan is typically performed with both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) contrast. However, most trauma centers no longer administer PO contrast because scans performed without oral contrast, particularly in children, have sufficient detail to establish and grade splenic injury. For obvious reasons, nonintravenous contrast CT scan has low sensitivity for parenchymal injury and cannot establish the presence of active bleeding (ie, contrast blush, active extravasation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the benefits of using IV contrast administration to diagnose bleeding needs to be weighed against the risk of complications related to IV contrast (eg, contrast-induced nephropathy), particularly in elderly patients. A screening noncontrast CT scan may provide some adequate information. When IV contrast is used, the arterial phase of image acquisition improves detection of traumatic contained splenic vascular injuries and should be considered to optimize detection of splenic injuries in trauma with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The differentiation between ascites and blood is made using the Hounsfield unit scale, which is a transformation of the linear attenuation coefficient of a material relative to water (at standard temperature and pressure). The Hounsfield unit of water (eg, ascites) is zero, and that of IV contrast 130. The value for blood varies depending upon whether it is clotted, and if so, the age of the clot. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;, section on 'General description'</a>.)</p><p>CT scan findings that indicate splenic injury include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoperitoneum &ndash; Localized fluid collections around the spleen (especially those with an elevated Hounsfield unit measurement) are highly suggestive of hemoperitoneum. Briskly bleeding splenic lacerations may establish blood density fluid throughout the abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypodensity &ndash; Hypodense regions represent areas of parenchymal disruption, intraparenchymal hematoma or subcapsular hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast blush or extravasation &ndash; Contrast blush describes hyperdense areas within the splenic parenchyma that represent traumatic disruption or pseudoaneurysm of the splenic vasculature. Active extravasation of contrast implies ongoing bleeding and the need for urgent intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

However, MRI may be applicable in a subset of hemodynamically stable patients with indeterminate spleen lesions on CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], or in those who cannot undergo CT scan (eg, allergic to IV contrast) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Noncontrast CT remains preferable for the acute diagnosis of splenic injury due to speed and accessibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLENIC INJURY GRADING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) has published a spleen injury grading scale based upon the anatomic injury identified on CT scan or intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The grade of injury and the degree of hemoperitoneum on CT scan relate to the success of nonoperative management, but do not consistently predict the need for initial operative intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> below.)</p><p>The AAST criteria for hematoma and laceration for each splenic injury grade are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Hematoma: subcapsular, &lt;10 percent of surface area.

Laceration: hilar vascular injury which devascularizes spleen.</p><p/><p>The AAST grade identified in the operating room is not always concordant with the grade of injury identified on imaging due to technical issues and variability of CT scan interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A modified CT grading system has been proposed that may better identify those patients who would benefit from initial angiographic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic injury can be initially managed with observation, angiographic embolization, or surgery depending upon the hemodynamic status of the patient, grade of splenic injury, and presence of other injuries and medical comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The management approach used may vary from institution to institution depending upon the availability of resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically unstable &ndash; Based upon ATLS principles, the hemodynamically unstable trauma patient with a positive FAST scan or <span class=\"nowrap\">DPA/DPL</span> requires emergent abdominal exploration to determine the source of intraperitoneal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically stable &ndash; Hemodynamically stable patients with low-grade (I to III) blunt or penetrating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] splenic injuries without any evidence for other intra-abdominal injuries, active contrast extravasation, or a blush on CT, may be initially observed safely. In general, patients who meet the criteria for observation but who require intervention to manage extra-abdominal injuries (eg, leg fracture stabilization) can also be safely observed. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Observation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>CT scan findings of contrast extravasation or vascular blush have higher failure rates for observational management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These patients may benefit from initial splenic embolization followed by continued observation to verify the success of the intervention. Another indication for embolization is intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysm formation. Splenic embolization is controversial for higher grade (IV, V) injuries and in patients older than 55. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Splenic embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgery is indicated in patients who cannot be adequately observed (due to limited resources or other injuries), are unlikely to tolerate a significant episode of hypotension, and those who fail nonsurgical management (ie, observation, embolization). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Failure of nonoperative management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Operative management'</a> below.)</p><p>Whether the management approach adopted for trauma patients can be extrapolated to guide the management of iatrogenic splenic trauma is unclear. Although splenic salvage is sometimes attempted for iatrogenic splenic trauma that occurs during surgery, more than 70 percent of patients ultimately undergo splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is unclear whether this is truly necessary or due to surgeons&rsquo; &ldquo;discomfort&rdquo; at watching a slowly oozing low-grade injury that would then necessitate a second surgery if nonoperative management fails.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic trauma was nearly uniformly managed with surgical exploration and splenectomy or attempted splenic salvage prior to the introduction of nonoperative management algorithms in the pediatric population. What seemed initially to be a radical approach was adopted over time by the adult trauma community. Nonoperative management, encompassing both observation and embolization techniques, is used to manage 50 to 70 percent of cases, typically for patients with lower grade injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Splenic injury grading'</a> above.)</p><p>The rationale for nonoperative management is based upon the assumption that salvaging functional splenic tissue avoids the surgical and anesthetic risks and complications associated with laparotomy and abrogates the risk of early infectious complications, and postsplenectomy sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,38</a>].</p><p>However, immune competence after injury that does not require removal of the spleen (eg, embolization, partial splenectomy) depends on the immunologic functionality of the residual splenic tissue and does not appear to be grade specific. The small risk of postsplenectomy sepsis appears higher at the extremes of age, but may be influenced by concomitant immune deficiency from solid organ transplantation, malignancy, and HIV disease. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetence after splenic injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications to nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonoperative management is not appropriate in patients with hemodynamic instability, generalized peritonitis, or for patients with other intra-abdominal injuries requiring surgical exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Portal hypertension is a relative contraindication due to the increased venous pressures that may prevent clot formation and control of hemorrhage even after successful splenic embolization. In a review of the National Trauma Data Bank, patients with liver cirrhosis had higher rates of complications, failure of nonoperative management, and mortality compared with noncirrhotic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a separate case control study, cirrhosis was an independent risk factor for splenectomy following splenic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, after propensity score matching, mortality after splenic injury was associated only with the admission MELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease), and not the splenectomy procedure.

The optimal management of hemodynamically stable patients with higher-grade (IV, V) injuries remains controversial, though grade V injuries are generally unsuitable for embolization due to vascular disruption. Some also consider Grade IV injuries to be a relative contraindication to splenic embolization. In one small retrospective review, 60 percent of patients with higher grade injuries were taken directly to the operating room. The remaining patients were managed nonoperatively with 55 percent of these patients ultimately requiring surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. We prefer to initially manage hemodynamically stable patients with Grade III or IV splenic injury with angiographic embolization as part of their nonoperative management, provided that they do not have large volume hemoperitoneum or other injuries that require abdominal exploration or medical comorbidities providing a contraindication.</p><p>Embolization is also relatively contraindicated in patients older than 55 due to higher failure rates in these patients. The splenic capsule thins with age (age &gt;55 years) and may render nonoperative management of higher-grade injuries (&gt;Grade III) in these patients less successful. However, injury severity-adjusted mortality rates do not appear significantly higher in this population compared with younger patients; but, overall, the experience with nonoperative management of higher-grade splenic injury in older patients is limited. Retrospective reviews suggest, however, that carefully selected individuals over 55 who are hemodynamically stable, and have no significant medical comorbidities, can also be safely managed with observation, with or without embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/35,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47,48</a>].

Of the patients who did not require immediate surgical intervention, 75 percent were successfully managed nonoperatively. Among three age groups, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and &gt;75 years of age, failure rates for nonoperative management increased and were 19, 27, and 28 percent, respectively, but these differences were not significant, possibly due to the small number of patients in each group. In a 2011 review of the National Trauma Data Bank, increasing age was associated with a slightly increased risk for failure of nonoperative management (odds ratio 1.014 per year of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful observation during nonoperative management for splenic trauma depends upon proper patient selection and the availability of adequate resources within the institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/27,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,50,51</a>].

In one retrospective review that included 773 patients with blunt splenic injury, outcomes of a cohort of patients (n = 616 patients from 2000 to 2012) who had mandatory repeat CT evaluation at 48 hours and angioembolization (if indicated) were compared with an earlier cohort for whom repeat scanning was selective (n = 157 from 1995 to 1999) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Patients may fail observational management either as an inpatient or, more rarely, as an outpatient presenting with &quot;delayed splenic rupture&quot;. A prospective study of 383 patients from 11 trauma centers ascertained the long-term risk of splenectomy after initial 24 hours of nonoperative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Twelve patients (3.1 percent) underwent in-hospital splenectomy between 24 hours and 9 days after injury. Only one patient, among 366 patients discharged with a spleen, ruptured on postinjury day 12. It is likely that &quot;delayed rupture&quot; more accurately describes those patients with splenic parenchymal pseudoaneurysms, the walls of which degrade during the normal process of clot dissolution with bleeding in a delayed fashion. In one review, delayed pseudoaneurysm or arterial extravasation was detected in 6 percent of patients and distributed among all injury grades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Indications to pursue intervention include hemodynamic instability, the development of diffuse peritoneal signs, or decreasing hemoglobin attributed to splenic hemorrhage.

Splenic embolization requires specialized imaging facilities and a vascular interventionalist (ie, interventional radiology, vascular surgeon) experienced with celiac artery catheterization and embolization techniques. Success rates for embolization vary depending upon institution, embolization technique, arterial accessibility, operator skill, and the type of embolization material. Where available, embolization is potentially most useful when employed selectively in hemodynamically stable patients who have CT findings that include active contrast extravasation, splenic pseudoaneurysm, or large volume hemoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16,23,24,65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24,65-68</a>]. </p><p>A number of observational studies have demonstrated that nonoperative management is more successful with the adjunctive use of angio-embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/15,69-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,69-76</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort analysis, 222 patients with blunt splenic injury treated between 1991 and 1998 were compared with 408 patients treated between 1998 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, vaccines are administered either 14 days prior to or 14 days following splenectomy for maximal immunologic benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. Delaying vaccinations for 14 days postoperatively increases the antibody response, but may not be feasible in all trauma patients given the historically sporadic follow-up in this patient population. Many centers will therefore vaccinate the patient at the time of discharge, regardless of the postoperative day. Asplenic patients should also receive yearly influenza vaccinations. </p><p>We recommend that asplenic patients wear medical jewelry and carry medical information cards identifying them as asplenic to alert future healthcare providers under the circumstance that the patient is unable to do so.</p><p>The need for immunization of patients following treatment for splenic injury compared with those undergoing elective splenectomy is still being defined. We vaccinate all patients who have undergone splenectomy following traumatic rupture because the extent to which a patient may (or may not) have functional residual splenic tissue (ie, splenosis) is uncertain. An experimental study demonstrated the ability of autogenic splenic implants to increase the rate of bacterial clearance and to remove colloidal substance and altered erythrocyte corpuscular inclusions, such as Howell-Jolly, Heinz, and Pappenheimer bodies, from the bloodstream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, whether this occurs with traumatic splenosis is unknown. Patients with deliberate replantation or spontaneous splenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89598\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89598 \">image 1</a>) have pitted red cell counts (counts less than 15 percent are consistent with immunocompetence) that are lower than those seen in splenectomized patients who do not have splenosis, but the count is not necessarily normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Splenosis'</a>.)</p><p>Following splenic salvage surgery, splenic embolization, or nonoperative management, we feel that immunization is <strong>not</strong> necessary, though some clinicians may disagree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>]. Available in-vitro studies indicate immunocompetence in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/105-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-114</a>]. In clinical studies of patients undergoing partial splenectomy for reasons other than trauma, humoral immunity was depressed only transiently following partial splenectomy, and compared with total splenectomy, partial splenectomy was associated with less risk for postsplenectomy infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>]. In a systematic review of 12 observational studies, most found that splenic function was preserved after partial splenectomy or splenic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. The validity of the studies that did not was questioned, as splenic function was assessed only after the first week following embolization. However, uncertainty remains since these studies used a variety of clinical parameters to assess the immunologic and hemofiltrative function of the spleen, and the best <span class=\"nowrap\">parameter/test</span> to&nbsp;assess immunocompetence in this population&nbsp;has not been determined. As an example, one controlled trial evaluating red blood cell pit counts found no differences for patients following successful nonoperatively managed high-grade injury (0.6 percent), and controls (0.7 percent); counts following splenectomy were 20.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic injury can result from either blunt or penetrating chest or abdominal trauma; blunt mechanisms are more common. Splenic injury can also be due to iatrogenic injury during the course of another procedure involving the colon, stomach, pancreas, kidney, or with exposure and reconstruction of the proximal abdominal aorta; the risk is greatest for patients undergoing colon resection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the trauma patient based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program developed by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A suspicion for splenic injury is increased with left upper quadrant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left chest trauma; however, clinical history and physical examination are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for the presence of splenic injury. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings indicative of splenic injury on focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination include findings of perisplenic or free intraperitoneal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT scan) findings consistent with splenic injury include splenic hypodensity, intraparenchymal or subcapsular hematoma, intravenous contrast blush, active intravenous contrast extravasation or hemoperitoneum. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic injury is graded (I through V) depending upon the extent and depth of splenic hematoma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laceration identified on CT scan or intraoperatively. Splenic injury grading is one factor used to stratify patient management. Other factors include associated injuries and medical comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Splenic injury grading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Per ATLS protocol, hemodynamically unstable patients with a positive FAST exam or diagnostic peritoneal lavage or aspirate <span class=\"nowrap\">(DPL/DPA)</span> require operative surgical exploration to determine the source of life-threatening hemorrhage that may be due to splenic injury. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hemodynamically stable patients with low grade (I to III) injuries, we suggest nonoperative management over definitive surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Observation involves monitored care, serial abdominal examination, and serial hemoglobin assessment, and may involve splenic embolization depending upon resources. Failure of nonoperative management indicates a need for angiographic embolization, if not initially used, or surgical exploration. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Observation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hemodynamically stable patients with active contrast extravasation or contrast blush on CT scan, we suggest initial splenic embolization over observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Splenic embolization requires specialized imaging facilities and a suitably experienced interventionalist. Failure of embolization indicates the need for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Splenic embolization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop hemodynamic instability during the course of nonoperative management, we suggest surgical exploration over splenic embolization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Failure of nonoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asplenic patients are regarded as having impaired immunity to encapsulated organisms and should be immunized against encapsulated organisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not undergone splenectomy, either because of successful nonoperative management (ie, observation with or without embolization) or operative splenic salvage, we suggest no immunization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
