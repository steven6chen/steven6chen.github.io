Inside the ankle are tough bands of tissue called ligaments, which hold the different bones together. During a sprain, one or more of those ligaments stretch too far or even tear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83022 \">figure 1</a>). This can cause pain and swelling, make the ankle unsteady, and make it hard to put weight on the ankle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4018320\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ankle sprain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include pain, tenderness, swelling, and bruising at the ankle. Some people with an ankle sprain also find it hard to move the foot in certain directions. Plus, some people cannot put weight on the ankle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4018335\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for ankle sprain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes and no. A doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a sprain by doing an exam and learning about what happened to your ankle. He or she might move your foot in different directions to see what hurts and to check how loose your ankle feels.</p><p>In some cases, a doctor or nurse might order an X-ray to check for broken bones, but that is not always needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4018350\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot put weight on your ankle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your ankle looks deformed or crooked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your ankle is unstable (for example, it gives out while you are climbing stairs)</p><p/><p>It's also best to see a doctor or nurse if you are not sure how serious an injury is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4018365\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ankle sprain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for a sprained ankle is easy to remember if you think of the word &quot;RICE.&quot; Here's what those letters stand for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rest</strong> &ndash; To rest the ankle, you can use crutches and stay off your feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ice</strong> &ndash; Apply a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on your ankle every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compression</strong> &ndash; Compression basically means pressure. You want to have your ankle under slight pressure by having it wrapped in an elastic &quot;compression&quot; bandage. This helps reduce swelling and supports the ankle. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to wrap your ankle. It's important that you do not use too much pressure and cut off the blood flow to your foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevation</strong> &ndash; &quot;Elevation&quot; means you should keep your foot raised up above the level of your heart. To do this, you can put your foot on some pillows or blankets while you are lying down, or on a table or chair while you are sitting.</p><p/><p>You can also take medicines to relieve pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>People who have a mild sprain do not usually need to use a splint to keep their foot and ankle still. But people who have a more severe sprain sometimes do.</p><p>In rare cases, doctors suggest surgery to repair a torn ligament caused by an ankle sprain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4018380\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most people who have had an ankle sprain heal more quickly if they do certain exercises. The right exercises for you will depend on what kind of sprain you have and how severe it is. Ask your doctor which exercises you should do.</p><p>As time passes, slowly build up the activities you do with your foot and ankle. You might have an easier time doing some activities if you wear a brace or splint on your ankle during your recovery.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
