They also have noncontraceptive benefits, being useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders including hyperandrogenism, dysmenorrhea, and menorrhagia. Currently available preparations are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 1</a>). There are, however, several contraindications to their use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Concern about toxicity (such as thromboembolic events and cardiovascular disease) initially limited the long-term use of these drugs. However, the decrease in both estrogen and progestin content since the introduction of the pill in 1960 has led to a reduction in both side effects and cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, these preparations are a reasonable contraceptive option for most women.</p><p>While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had previously set upper age limits for OC use as 35 years for smokers and 40 years for nonsmokers, the age limit was removed in 1989 for healthy, nonsmoking women. Thus, OCs can be given until menopause in such women. Caution is still needed in prescribing OCs for women who smoke and an effort to induce smoking cessation should be made first.</p><p>Certain forms of toxicity remain a concern. This topic will review the side effects and major potential risks associated with OC administration. The noncontraceptive benefits of estrogen-progestin contraceptives and other types of contraception are reviewed separately.

Although they may be bothersome enough to lead to discontinuation of the OC, these side effects usually subside in several months. Abnormal bleeding is a common problem that often resolves. Weight gain is not a consistent finding with low-dose pills. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Weight'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Breakthrough bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect of OCs. Its occurrence does not indicate a decrease in efficacy, but reflects tissue breakdown as the endometrium adjusts to a new thin state in which it is fragile and atrophic. Breakthrough bleeding is more of a problem with lower doses of estrogen because estrogen stabilizes the endometrium. In addition, bleeding is more common with extended and continuous regimens, although most women eventually develop amenorrhea.</p><p>The most common cause of breakthrough bleeding is thought to be missed pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women should be cautioned that missing pills results in an increase in breakthrough bleeding as well as a decrease in contraceptive efficacy.</p><p>Follicular development with increased estrogen concentrations may also occur with the lower-dose preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other causes include smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and drug interactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Drug interactions'</a>.)</p><p>Although contraceptive efficacy appears to be similar for different progestins, limited data suggest that the third-generation progestins may be associated with less intermenstrual bleeding than earlier progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, we do not consider this to be a reason to choose third-generation progestins over earlier ones.</p><p>Our approach to treatment of bleeding starts with patient reassurance and encouragement to take the OC for at least three cycles before making any changes. If the bleeding does not stop, a cervical examination and pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural causes of bleeding, such as uterine fibroids or polyps, should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amenorrhea is the goal with the continuous and extended estrogen-progestin regimens. However, amenorrhea may also occur with the standard preparations containing 21 days of hormone and seven days of placebo, most commonly with the lower-dose pills containing 20 mcg. Amenorrhea is the desired outcome with the extended regimens, but it is a bothersome problem with the standard cyclic regimens because of the monthly concern that pregnancy might have occurred.</p><p>If the woman is on a low dose (20 mcg OC), switching to a 30 to 35 mcg preparation often restores menses. Our most common approach is to simply reassure the patient that the amenorrhea is not a sign of a new endocrine problem, nor does it mean that she is not getting reliable contraception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-pill amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It had previously been thought that women who used OCs were at risk of developing subsequent irregular menses or amenorrhea. However, data suggest that the incidence and endocrinologic findings in women with amenorrhea occurring after the use of cyclic OC regimens are the same as in women with spontaneous amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This appears to be true for continuous pill regimens, as well, as illustrated in a report of 187 women using the continuous pill for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After stopping the pill, the median time to return to menses was 32 days, and spontaneous menses or pregnancy occurred at day &le;90 in 185 of 187 women (98.9 percent).</p><p>Thus, women who do not menstruate three months after discontinuing an OC should undergo the same evaluation for amenorrhea as any woman with amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolism of oral contraceptives (OCs) is accelerated by any drug that increases liver microsomal enzyme activity such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>.

However, the reduction in estrogen content has increased safety substantially. Because myocardial infarction (MI) is an extremely rare event in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age, even a doubling of the risk would result in an extremely low attributable risk. Risk in older women who smoke outweighs the risk of an unwanted pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Much of what is known about the potential risks of oral contraceptives (OCs) comes from four large cohort studies: the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Study, the Oxford Family Planning Association Study, the Walnut Creek Contraceptive Drug Study, and the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of epidemiologic studies have reported an increase in MI, thought to be related to a thrombotic mechanism rather than the development of atherosclerotic plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and an increase in cardiovascular mortality in estrogen-progestin contraceptive users over age 35 years who smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These studies included women who used both high (&ge;50 mcg ethinyl estradiol) and low-dose (&le;35 mcg ethinyl estradiol) OCs. However, the absolute risk of an MI in a nonsmoker using a pill containing 20 to 40 mcg of ethinyl estradiol is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>Newer &ldquo;third-generation&rdquo; OCs (eg, those containing desogestrel, norgestimate, or gestodene) have more favorable effects on the lipid profile than second-generation preparations, but this did not translate into a lower risk of MI in two case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a third study, the risk of MI appeared to be lower in women using third rather than second-generation OCs (relative risk [RR] 1.3 versus 2.5, respectively), but the difference was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10 studies calculated an overall doubling of cardiovascular mortality risk (due to coronary heart disease [CHD]) in women using OCs with less than 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, because MI is an extremely rare event in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age, even a doubling of the risk would result in an extremely low attributable risk.</p><p>The largest cohort study of hormonal contraception and arterial thrombosis risk was published after the meta-analysis and included the entire population of Danish women ages 15 to 49 years, followed from 1995 to 2009, with nearly 500 MIs and over 1000 strokes in current users of hormonal contraception. In an analysis adjusted for differences in progestin type and age, OCs containing ethinyl estradiol doses of 20 mcg or 30 to 40 mcg were associated with an increased risk of MI (RR 1.4 and 1.88, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Risks did not differ significantly between type of progestin. In spite of the apparent excess risk of MI, the absolute risk of an event with OCs is very low; the authors estimated that among 10,000 women who use a pill containing ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg with desogestrel for one year, two will have arterial thrombosis (MI or thrombotic stroke) (versus 6.8 with venous thrombosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Stroke'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The number of MIs was too low to estimate risk for the contraceptive patch and vaginal ring. No excess risk was seen with any of the progestin-only formulations.</p><p>Theoretically, the increase in MI risk may be more clinically relevant in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (who are thought to be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, there are no clinical data on the risk of MI with OC use in this group of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A consensus panel reviewing the issue of OCs in women over 35 years who smoke suggested that OCs should not be given to those who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day, but they can be considered in women who smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes per day, since the risks of pregnancy in this age group are greater than the risks associated with OC use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines agree with this approach. However, patients often underreport the number of cigarettes smoked per day and, therefore, we agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) that the risk of OC use is unacceptable for women over 35 years who smoke at all.</p><p>On the other hand, for younger women, the benefits of OCs appear to outweigh the risks, even among heavy smokers, as long as there is no family history of thromboembolic disease.</p><p>Women who have taken an OC are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk for CHD later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In summary, some, but not all, studies report that OCs may be associated with an increased risk of MI. However, because MI is an extremely rare event in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age, even a doubling of the risk would result in an extremely low attributable risk. Risk in older women who smoke outweighs the risk of an unwanted pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OCs frequently cause a mild elevation in blood pressure within the normal range; however, overt hypertension can occur. Early reports suggesting an incidence of hypertension of 5 percent involved preparations containing at least 50 mcg of estrogen and 1 to 4 mg of progestin. The effect of current low-dose OCs was assessed in a report from the Nurses' Health Study, which prospectively evaluated almost 70,000 nurses aged 25 to 42 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After adjustment for age, weight, smoking, family history, and other risk factors, the RR of hypertension compared with women who never used OCs was 1.8 for current users and 1.2 for previous users. Overall, only 41.5 cases per 10,000 person-years could be attributed to OC use; this risk rapidly declined with cessation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-hormonal-contraceptives-and-postmenopausal-hormone-therapy-on-blood-pressure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of hormonal contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy on blood pressure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although OC-induced hypertension is not common, its recognition is important, as hypertensive OC users appear to be at increased risk of MI and stroke relative to nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OC use has been associated with a small but significant increase in ischemic stroke risk in many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], studies. This was a particular concern with early OC preparations that contained high doses of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. OC preparations containing less than 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol are associated with a lower risk of stroke than high-dose preparations. Of note is that in otherwise healthy young women (nonsmokers without hypertension), the attributable risk is extremely low because baseline risk of ischemic stroke is so low in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In all of these studies, the <strong>absolute</strong> risk of stroke was very low in young women (11.3 per 100,000 patients per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

In the analysis adjusted for differences in progestin type and age, for preparations containing ethinyl estradiol doses of 20 mcg or 30 to 40 mcg, the RRs of thrombotic stroke risk were 1.6 and 1.75, respectively.

In addition, two antiandrogenic progestins (drospirenone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>) have been associated with a similar increase in VTE risk. However, the absolute excess risk is small, and is considered medically acceptable given the many benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives. Evidence for the role of progestin type on VTE risk includes the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 studies, the incidence of VTE among nonusers of OCs from two included cohort studies was 0.19 and 0.37 per 1000 woman-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Use of combined OCs increased the risk of VTE (relative risk [RR] 3.5, 95% CI 2.9-4.3). The RR of VTE for OCs containing ethinyl estradiol (30 to 35 mcg) with gestodene, desogestrel, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, or drospirenone was similar and approximately 50 to 80 percent higher than OCs containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>. The absolute risk of an event was still low, even for the progestins associated with higher risk.

Although they may be bothersome enough to lead to discontinuation of the OC, these side effects usually subside in several months. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect of OCs. The most common cause of breakthrough bleeding is thought to be missed pills, but it is common in women who do not miss pills. Its occurrence does not indicate a decrease in efficacy, but reflects tissue breakdown as the endometrium adjusts to a new thin state in which it is fragile and atrophic. Breakthrough bleeding is more of a problem with lower doses of estrogen because estrogen stabilizes the endometrium. In addition, bleeding is more common with extended and continuous regimens, although most women eventually develop amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Breakthrough bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OC use does not cause subsequent menstrual cycle disorders, including amenorrhea. Women who do not menstruate three months after discontinuing an OC should undergo the same evaluation for amenorrhea as any woman with amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Post-pill amenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most data suggest that weight gain is not a consistent finding with OCs. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OCs may be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). However, because MI is an extremely rare event in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age, even a doubling of the risk would result in an extremely low attributable risk. Risk in older women who smoke outweighs the risk of an unwanted pregnancy. Low-dose OCs may be associated with a small increase in stroke risk. If present, the absolute increase in risk is extremely low, particularly in healthy women under age 35 years (nonsmokers without hypertension). Risk appears to be similar for different progestins, and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke does not appear to be increased. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is seen with both high and low-dose estrogen OC preparations. Although the reduction in steroid content of OCs has improved the safety and side effect profile of the pill, the increased risk of venous thrombosis has not been eliminated. Risk is affected by patient age, weight, and thrombophilia status. The type of progestin also affects risk. A pooled analysis of studies regarding the use of OCs found that the risk ratios for thromboembolism in women taking non-third-generation OCs compared with women who did not take an OC ranged from 1.1 to 4.8 (depending upon the type of study). However, the absolute risk of thromboembolism is very low in healthy women, and the potential risk of VTE with the use of OCs is far less than the risks associated with unintended pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer are both reduced with OC use. The risk of cervical cancer appears to be increased, while data on breast cancer are conflicting. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Risk of cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) conclude from the literature that women with a history of migraine headaches who take OCs are at increased risk for cerebral thromboembolism, and that the risks of OC use usually outweigh the benefits in women over age 35 years with migraines. In addition, they suggest that for women of any age with migraines associated with aura or focal symptoms, the risk of OC use is unacceptable. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Migraine headaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Petitti DB.
