E-cigarettes entered the market in 2003 in China and entered the United States and European markets in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In many areas, e-cigarettes entered the market as consumer products without government regulation. Initially produced by small companies, tobacco companies have bought some of these companies and are developing these products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. They are available both online and in traditional retail outlets.</p><p>There is uncertainty about the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes and whether they will help individual tobacco users to stop smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. There are also public health concerns, including concerns about the effect of e-cigarettes on smoking prevalence and their potential use by children as a gateway to subsequently using combustible tobacco products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of e-cigarettes, including information about devices, use, components, adverse health effects, use in smoking cessation, impact on public health, as well as suggestions for patient counseling. An overview of smoking cessation and pharmacotherapies and behavioral therapies for smoking cessation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1032355223\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICES AND USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>E-cigarettes are a type of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) consisting of a cartridge containing a liquid, an atomizer (vaporization chamber with a heating element), and a battery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98585 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>The user activates the atomizer either by inhaling or by pressing a button, depending on the device characteristics. The atomizer then heats and aerosolizes the liquid in the cartridge, creating a vapor that emulates but is not tobacco smoke. This process simulates the experience of smoking a conventional cigarette, but no combustion occurs. The term &quot;vaping&quot; is used to distinguish the process from smoking a conventional cigarette. The term &ldquo;dripping&rdquo; is used to describe a technique in which a couple of drops of the liquid in the e-cigarette cartridge are dripped directly onto the atomizer&rsquo;s heating element to create a cloud of vapor that can be inhaled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>E-cigarettes originally were designed to resemble conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarette technology is rapidly evolving. Newer versions resemble cigarettes less and feature rechargeable batteries as well as heating elements and refillable cartridges that can deliver higher concentrations of nicotine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98522 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First-generation products</strong> &ndash; First-generation e-cigarettes mimic the shape and size of conventional cigarettes and may be referred to as &quot;cigalikes.&quot; They come in two versions. Disposable first-generation e-cigarettes are neither rechargeable nor refillable and are discarded after they stop producing vapor. Reusable first-generation products have rechargeable batteries and replaceable cartridges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Second-generation products</strong> &ndash; Second-generation e-cigarettes are larger than conventional cigarettes and are either pen-style (medium size) or tank-style (large size). Both feature stronger, rechargeable batteries that may have a switch or electronic circuits that allow users to regulate the frequency and length of puffs or the power delivery to the atomizer. The cartridges in second-generation e-cigarettes are refillable and allow the user to adjust the contents of the e-cigarette liquid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Third-generation products</strong> &ndash; Third-generation e-cigarettes are similar to second-generation devices but allow for more custom modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They are known as &quot;personalized vaporizers.&quot; There are a range of options for cartridges and atomizers; some devices allow the user to adjust the resistance of the atomizer, which produces higher heating temperatures. Users can also pair different atomizers with high-capacity batteries to increase vapor production and battery life.</p><p/><p>Another type of heating device is used in heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco cigarettes. The device heats tobacco to a much lower temperature than that of a traditional tobacco cigarette. HNB cigarettes are described separately.

The liquid is heated to produce a vapor the user inhales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Across all brands, the main components of the liquid vaporized are nicotine (although some are nicotine-free), propylene glycol or glycerol, and flavorings. A variety of other compounds have also been identified, some with carcinogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].

Web-based consumer surveys of adults reported that between 2010 and 2013, ever use of e-cigarettes increased from 3.3 to 8.5 percent of all adults, while current use (use in the past 30 days) increased from 1.3 to 1.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another smaller survey reported a larger increase in ever use from 1.8 percent in 2010 to 13.0 percent in 2013, while current use increased from 0.3 to 6.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The 2014 National Health Interview Survey provided the first nationally-representative estimates of e-cigarette use among adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Overall, 12.6 percent of adults had ever used an e-cigarette, 3.7 percent were current users (defined as using at least once in the past 30 days), and 1.1 percent were daily users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The prevalence of current e-cigarette use was highest in current cigarette smokers (16 percent) and former smokers who had quit cigarettes in the past year (22 percent). By contrast, there was minimal current use of e-cigarettes by never smokers (&lt;1 percent) and former smokers who quit more than one year ago (2.3 percent).</p><p>National surveys in the United States found that middle and high school students reported more current use of e-cigarettes than any other tobacco product in 2015 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101254 \">figure 2</a>), and a survey in Canada found that 6 percent of 6<sup>th</sup>- to 12<sup>th</sup>-grade students had used them within 30 days in 2014 to 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. E-cigarette use was rising among adolescents in the United States until 2015, when a dip in use was seen from 16 percent in 2015 to 11 percent in 2016 among high school students, and from 5.3 to 4.3 percent among middle school students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/26,31,32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31,32,34,35</a>].</p><p>Additionally, in a survey at eight high schools, over 25 percent of e-cigarette users reported also using an e-cigarette device for &ldquo;dripping&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Many studies find no evidence of a gender difference in e-cigarette use, but the 2014 National Adult Tobacco Survey reported a higher use among males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. That survey also found a higher rate of e-cigarette use among whites than nonwhites.</p><p>E-cigarette users are generally nondaily users of the product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In a United States survey, only 5.3 percent of adults who had ever used an e-cigarette reported daily use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Studies suggest that approximately 12 to 14 percent of smokers who try e-cigarettes progress to daily use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, recent former smokers had a higher odds of regular e-cigarette use than other former smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Most adult and adolescent regular users of e-cigarettes already smoke conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/2,25,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,44,45</a>]. Among adults, a review published in 2014 estimated that only 1.2 percent of never smokers in the United States and 0.5 percent of never smokers in Great Britain had tried e-cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/25,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,39</a>].

The 2014 United States National Adult Tobacco Survey reported that 3.2 percent of adults who had never smoked cigarettes had ever used an e-cigarette and 0.4 percent of never cigarette smokers were current e-cigarette users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the United Kingdom in 2015, an estimated 1.7 percent of never cigarette smokers are current e-cigarette users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Rates of e-cigarette use appear to be increasing among current and former smokers but not among never smokers in the United States. In a web-based consumer survey in the United States, between 2010 and 2013, ever use of e-cigarettes increased among current smokers (9.8 to 36.5 percent) and former smokers (2.5 to 9.6 percent) but was unchanged among never smokers (1.3 to 1.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In surveys and a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of a randomized trial, a majority of e-cigarette users perceive them to be a tool to quit conventional cigarettes or reduce their risk of tobacco-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/37,47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,47-53</a>]. For example, a survey of 2501 United States smokers found a greater interest in using e-cigarettes for the purpose of smoking cessation or reduction than for novelty or to cope with smoking restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1102655289\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No observational data examining the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes exist. However, potential adverse effects are related to nicotine exposure as well as exposure to other components in the vapor produced by the devices. Further, a retrospective review identified emergency department visits for burns from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) due to device malfunction either while stored (eg, in a pocket) or during use, resulting in burns to the thigh, groin, face, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1102655710\"><span class=\"h2\">Nicotine exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine exposure from e-cigarette use, as with cigarette smoking, increases heart rate and produces measurable levels of blood cotinine, a nicotine metabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of nicotine&quot;, section on 'Smoking and cardiovascular risk'</a>.)</p><p>The amount of nicotine delivered and the level of nicotine in the blood varies depending on nicotine concentration in the e-cigarette liquid, other components in the e-cigarette liquid, user experience, puffing intensity, device characteristics, and vaping technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Experienced e-cigarette users tend to take longer puffs and use the device more intensively compared with novice users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. As a consequence, they have higher blood nicotine levels that more closely resemble the levels achieved by smoking conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/56,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59,60</a>]. In less-experienced users, however, the nicotine delivered by e-cigarettes is consistently lower than nicotine delivered by conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Data on the health consequences of chronic nicotine exposure alone in the absence of cigarette smoking is available from studies of chronic users of nicotine replacement products.

[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] The consequences of chronic inhalation of e-cigarette vapor are largely unknown, and levels of toxic and carcinogenic compounds may vary by e-cigarette liquid components and device used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Little is known about the overall safety or the carcinogenic effects of propylene glycol or glycerol when heated and aerosolized. At high temperatures, propylene glycol decomposes and may form propylene oxide, a probable human carcinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Glycerol produces the toxin acrolein, though the levels produced are lower than conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Both propylene glycol and glycerol decompose to form the carcinogens formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, with levels depending on the voltage of the battery used in the e-cigarette [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>].</p><p>Other carcinogenic compounds have been found in e-cigarettes but in trace amounts that are much lower than levels found in conventional cigarettes.

A small observational study found that users of e-cigarettes for at least six months who did not also smoke combustible cigarettes had substantially lower urinary and salivary concentrations of TSNAs and VOCs than did smokers of combustible cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The long-term cardiovascular risks of e-cigarette use are unknown, and aerosol constituents that may influence this risk include nicotine, oxidizing chemicals, particulate matter, and acrolein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A small observational study found that e-cigarette use for at least one year was associated with factors that have been correlated with increased cardiovascular risk: increased oxidative stress and a shift toward sympathetic predominance in cardiac autonomic balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In contrast, another small study found that, compared with a sham control or non-nicotine e-cigarette, acute exposure to an e-cigarette containing nicotine was not associated with increased oxidative stress but was associated with increased cardiac sympathetic nerve activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Similar to cigarette smoke, e-cigarette vapor contains particulate matter, with reports suggesting that the concentration is similar to conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. It is not known whether the particles in e-cigarette vapor have any toxicity. The few investigations of the acute physiological effects of inhaling e-cigarette vapor have found changes in airway respiratory function that are much smaller than those generated by conventional cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Two observational studies suggest an association between e-cigarette use and respiratory symptoms in adolescents. One survey study of over 45,000 students (mean age 14.6 years) in Hong Kong found that e-cigarette use was associated with respiratory symptoms (cough or phlegm), regardless of smoking status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Similarly, a survey of 11<sup>th</sup>- and 12<sup>th</sup>-grade students in California found an association between self-reported chronic bronchitic symptoms (chronic cough, phlegm, or bronchitis in the past year) and current or past e-cigarette use that remained after adjustment for confounders such as cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure; risk increased with frequency of current use of e-cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The effect of inhaling flavorings on respiratory function is also uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Specifically, diacetyl, a chemical associated with respiratory diseases, has been found in sweet-flavored e-cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Cherry-flavored e-cigarettes have been found to contain benzaldehyde, a compound that has been associated with respiratory irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Smokers who stop using conventional cigarettes (and therefore are considered to have quit) may or may not have also continued to use e-cigarettes. Stopping the use of both conventional cigarettes and e-cigarette use is preferred because it avoids whatever risk may be associated with chronic exposure to e-cigarettes alone.

Only one randomized trial has tested the efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation among smokers who want to quit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In the trial, which was conducted in New Zealand, 657 smokers were assigned to use nicotine containing 16 mg e-cigarettes, nicotine-free e-cigarettes, or 21 mg nicotine patches. At six-month follow-up, the biochemically-verified smoking cessation rate was modest and did not differ significantly by group (7.3 percent with nicotine e-cigarettes, 4.1 percent with nicotine-free e-cigarettes, 5.8 percent with patches). The trial suggested that e-cigarettes might have a similar efficacy to the nicotine patch for smoking cessation; additional studies are needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached. However, the quit rates observed were less than in most clinical trials, suggesting there may have been selection bias or other issues in the study. A subsequent randomized trial in 300 smokers not intending to quit compared two strengths of e-cigarettes with a placebo no-nicotine e-cigarette and found no differences in quit rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Observational studies report mixed results about the efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/e-cigarettes/abstract/37,90-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,90-98</a>].

Overall, compared with the previous survey done in 2010 to 2011 (prior to the dramatic increase in use of e-cigarettes in the United States), the more recent survey showed higher population smoking quit rates (5.6 versus 4.5 percent).

(See <a href=\"#H1032355223\" class=\"local\">'Devices and use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of e-cigarettes in adults and adolescents has increased since 2010. Most e-cigarette users are also cigarette smokers. A majority of e-cigarette users perceive them to be a tool to quit or reduce their smoking. (See <a href=\"#H3632574907\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and patterns of use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Across all brands, the main components in e-cigarette liquids are nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerol, and flavorings. A variety of other compounds have also been identified. (See <a href=\"#H1032355305\" class=\"local\">'E-cigarette liquid components'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term health consequences of e-cigarette use are largely unknown but are likely to be considerably less than continuing to smoke conventional cigarettes because e-cigarettes do not expose the user to many of the toxins in tobacco smoke. E-cigarettes expose users to nicotine as well as heated and aerosolized propylene glycol and glycerol and other compounds. The toxicity of chronic exposure to these and the other components of e-cigarettes is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1102655289\" class=\"local\">'Adverse health effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety and efficacy of e-cigarette use for smoking cessation is unknown. Clinicians should encourage smokers who seek to quit smoking and ask about e-cigarettes to use US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved smoking cessation aids as a first choice and make sure that newer, approved strategies for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy are offered. If a smoker is not willing to use these evidence-based approaches and asks about using e-cigarettes, the clinician need not discourage e-cigarette use as long as the smoker is informed about the uncertainties of the devices' safety and efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H28394414\" class=\"local\">'Role in smoking cessation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28394438\" class=\"local\">'Counseling for patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Public health concerns regarding e-cigarettes include their potential to increase youth initiation of tobacco products and to renormalize tobacco use in places where cigarette smoking is not acceptable. Accidental nicotine poisoning in children has been reported. The health effects of secondhand vapor exposure are unknown. (See <a href=\"#H28394426\" class=\"local\">'Public health concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation for e-cigarettes varies worldwide and is changing. (See <a href=\"#H28394432\" class=\"local\">'Regulatory status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28394452\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author wishes to acknowledge Harvard Medical School student Mark Wu, BS, who assisted with the preparation of this topic review.
