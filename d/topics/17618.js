The diagnosis may be suspected by clinical and noninvasive features and is confirmed by histopathologic criteria on endomyocardial biopsy. The clinical manifestations of this disorder vary greatly from asymptomatic changes on an electrocardiogram to fulminant heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of myocarditis in adults. Treatment of myocarditis consists of both specific therapy aimed at the cause of the myocarditis and nonspecific therapy aimed at the clinical manifestations such as HF and arrhythmias. The etiology, incidence, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of myocarditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A significant minority of patients with pericarditis also have myocarditis. Myocarditis associated with pericarditis, including vaccinia-associated disease (myocarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericarditis), is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15091226\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable disease course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of myocarditis varies with the presenting clinical syndrome. </p><p>The prevalence and outcomes of myocarditis in community-based populations are unknown. However, seroepidemiologic studies suggest that the majority of cases of Coxsackie B virus infection are subclinical and have a benign course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In hospital- or clinic-based referral populations, the prognosis of myocarditis varies with the type or cause and the severity of presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The spectrum of myocarditis outcomes is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of asymptomatic patients who develop inflammation as evidenced by electrocardiographic changes, the inflammatory process is apparently self-limited without overt sequelae. A minority of initially asymptomatic patients develop HF, serious arrhythmias, or disturbances of conduction. Rarely, post-viral myocarditis is fatal due to myocardial failure or sudden, unexpected death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute myopericarditis, defined as clinical pericarditis with elevated troponin and preserved left ventricular function, is associated with low risk of heart failure (HF) or death (eg, no HF or deaths among 114 patients at median three-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, most patients with symptomatic post-viral or lymphocytic myocarditis present with HF and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, subtle signs and symptoms of cardiac involvement may be overshadowed by systemic manifestations of the viral infection. As an example, in the United States Myocarditis Treatment Trial, 89 percent of subjects reported a syndrome consistent with a viral prodrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worse outcomes have been reported by studies of patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis. As an example, a case series of 174 patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis from Padua, Italy, in which over half of the patients had baseline symptomatic or asymptomatic left ventricular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right ventricular systolic dysfunction, reported an actuarial rate of death or transplantation of 13 percent at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a series of 203 patients from Germany with myocarditis with viral genome detected on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), the prognosis was similar with 19.2 percent all-cause mortality at 4.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Higher mortality rates were noted in a large single-center registry of biopsy-proven myocarditis from Massachusetts General Hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of 112 consecutive patients with histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis, rates of death or transplantation were 21 and 44 percent at one and five years, respectively. </p><p/><p>The disease course for patients with fulminant myocarditis differs from that in patients with nonfulminant myocarditis as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fulminant myocarditis'</a> below.) </p><p><br/>Myocarditis is a cause of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although only a small fraction of patients with lymphocytic myocarditis present with ventricular arrhythmias, as many as one-third of patients diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia may have myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Myocarditis also causes some cases of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>In a significant minority of patients with acute myocarditis, impaired ventricular function, arrhythmias, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disturbances of conduction may persist for months to years; this can be due to residual scar tissue, persistent active myocarditis, or occasionally persistent viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In a review of 1230 patients with initially unexplained cardiomyopathy, 9 percent had myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive value of autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac-specific autoantibodies have been identified in subsets of patients with acute or chronic myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>] and appear to be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with chronic myocarditis and a better prognosis in patients with acute myocarditis. Presence of autoantibodies was associated with increased risk of progression from chronic myocarditis to DCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74290 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As an example, the presence of anti-alpha myosin autoantibodies was associated with lower likelihood of improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in a series of 33 patients with chronic myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with antibodies had no improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at six months compared with a 9 percent absolute increase in those without antibodies. Similarly, the presence of anti-heart antibodies in relatives of patients with idiopathic DCM predicted future left ventricular dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>By contrast, in patients with acute myocarditis, higher titers of IgG were associated with better left ventricular function in the Myocarditis Treatment Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One possible explanation is that the acute immune response to viral infection usually serves to eliminate the pathogen and improve heart function, but in genetically susceptible patients, autoimmunity is induced, leading to progression to chronic DCM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105028682\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis based on etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data suggest that prognosis of myocarditis likely varies among clinicopathologic types.

In a series of 109 cases with Dallas criteria positive (active or borderline) myocarditis, findings at presentation that were predictive of subsequent death or transplantation were syncope (relative risk 8.5), bundle branch block (relative risk 2.9), and an LVEF &lt;40 percent (relative risk 2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although borderline histology was protective, this was not seen in other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. In a prospective study on 174 patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis, presence of signs and symptoms of biventricular dysfunction was the main predictor of death or heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Another adverse prognostic factor is the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension. This was illustrated in a prospective study of 1134 patients with a new cardiomyopathy who underwent right heart catheterization and EMB and were followed for 4.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a multivariate model, mean pulmonary artery pressure was the most important hemodynamic predictor of death, especially in the 93 patients (8.3 percent) with a diagnosis of myocarditis. For each 5 mmHg increase in baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure, the mortality in those with and without myocarditis increased with a relative hazard of 1.85 and 1.23, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Fulminant myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fulminant myocarditis is defined as myocarditis with new onset severe heart failure requiring parenteral inotropic or mechanical circulatory support. Patients with fulminant myocarditis face high mortality risk. In a contemporary series of 187 patients with acute myocarditis, individuals with a fulminant presentation had a lower rate of in-hospital heart transplant-free survival (74.5 versus 100 percent) as well as lower transplant-free survival at 9 years (64.5 versus 100 percent) than patients with nonfulminant myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although there was greater improvement in LVEF during hospitalization among patients with fulminant myocarditis (32 versus 3 absolute percentage points), the proportion of patients with LVEF &lt;55 percent remained higher with fulminant myocarditis than with nonfulminant myocarditis (29 versus 9 percent). </p><p>By contrast, older studies of patients with acute myocarditis suggested that lymphocytic fulminant myocarditis may be associated with better prognosis than nonfulminant myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. Differing results in the later study compared with earlier studies likely reflect differences in patient populations. In the earlier studies, patients presented primarily with dilated cardiomyopathy with diagnosis confirmed by Dallas or similar criteria on EMB (more likely to identify severe cases), while in the later study, patients presented with a greater spectrum of symptoms ranging from chest pain and palpitations to dyspnea, and diagnosis was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or immunohistochemistry on EMB, so less severe cases of myocarditis were included. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Persistence of viral genome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important predictor of outcome in patients with viral myocarditis may be the persistence of the viral genome in the myocardium. This was suggested in a consecutive series of 172 patients with biopsy-proven viral infection; the patients had a relatively long duration of symptoms (5.1 months) before the initial EMB and were already on a reasonable HF regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among the 151 patients with a single infection (most frequently enterovirus), follow-up biopsy at a median of 6.8 months revealed spontaneous clearance of the viral genome in 55 (36 percent). These patients had a significant increase in LVEF (from 50 to 58 percent), while those with persisting viral genomes had a significant reduction in LVEF (from 54 to 51 percent).</p><p>Persistence of viral genome may also identify patients particularly unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>However, other case series in which parvovirus B19 was the most frequent pathogen have not demonstrated an effect of viral genome on the risk of death or heart transplantation, raising a possibility that viral genomes may sometimes reflect latent and not active viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Although these data suggest that persistence of viral genome may predict a gradual deterioration of left ventricular function in chronic DCM, a clinical role for EMB in the management of such patients will depend upon more definitive evidence of effective treatment of viral cardiomyopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Predictive value of serologic markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although clinical parameters are only partly predictive of outcome, serologic markers, particularly soluble Fas ligand (FasL) and interleukin (IL)-10, may be useful in acute, severe myocarditis. Fas (CD95), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, is expressed following B-cell activation. Binding of Fas with its natural ligand (FasL, which is expressed on activated T-cells) triggers apoptotic cell death. As a result, Fas regulates clonal expansion of autoreactive B-cells.</p><p>In one series, serum concentrations of soluble Fas and FasL were significantly higher in patients with acute myocarditis (predominantly lymphocytic) compared with normals or patients with an old myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among the patients with myocarditis, Fas and FasL concentrations were significantly higher in those who died during hospitalization compared with those discharged from the hospital after recovery.</p><p>Further support for the role of Fas comes from a study of 20 patients with recent-onset idiopathic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The patients in the highest tertile of Fas expression in the myocardium had minimal improvement in LVEF at six months compared with those in the intermediate and lowest tertiles (3 versus 10 and 21 percent, respectively).</p><p>A higher serum IL-10 concentration on admission may be predictive of cardiogenic shock and death in patients with fulminant (predominantly lymphocytic) myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27210682\"><span class=\"h4\">Overlap with recent-onset idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients presenting with recent-onset (&le;6 months) idiopathic DCM have myocarditis. The prognosis in patients with recent-onset idiopathic DCM may be fairly good. In a multicenter registry of 377 patients with acute DCM who received contemporary HF treatment and an average baseline LVEF of 24 percent at entry, LVEF improved to 40 percent at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Transplant-free survival at one, two, and four years was 94, 92, and 88 percent, respectively. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Giant cell myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare and frequently fatal type of myocarditis. In contrast to the variable clinical course of DCM due to lymphocytic myocarditis, the clinical course in GCM is usually characterized by acute or fulminant deterioration in left ventricular systolic function despite standard HF treatment, frequent ventricular arrhythmias, and heart block. </p><p>The prognosis of GCM with no or limited immunosuppressive therapy is poor. In a study published in 1997 based on international case reports of 63 patients with GCM, the presenting symptoms were HF (75 percent), ventricular arrhythmias (14 percent), and heart block (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Initial symptoms resembling an acute myocardial infarction were present in 6 percent. The rate of death or cardiac transplant was 89 percent and the median survival from onset of symptoms was 5.5 months. This represents a significantly worse prognosis compared with lymphocytic or presumed viral myocarditis. As an example, in the Myocarditis Treatment Trial, approximately 50 percent of patients with lymphocytic myocarditis were alive without cardiac transplant at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with a combination of immunosuppressive agents may improve prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A report from Helsinki of 32 patients with GCM (including 26 patients treated with combined immunosuppression [two to four drugs]) found survival rates similar to those previously reported for lymphocytic myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of transplant-free survival from symptom onset were 69 percent at one year, 58 percent at two years, and 52 percent at five years. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias was high. Of the transplant-free survivors, 10 of 17 experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia during follow-up with three receiving appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks.

As noted above, some patients with DCM have evidence of myocarditis. Although viral infection is the most commonly identified cause for myocarditis presenting as DCM, investigation does not reveal an etiology in approximately 50 percent of patients. The majority of these cases probably result from an occult infection, an autoimmune process, or the early stages of a genetically determined myocardial disease. The possible role of autoimmunity has led to evaluation of the effectiveness of IVIG in patients with DCM. </p><p>As described below, a small randomized trial found no benefit in patients with acute (recent-onset) DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>] but another trial suggested a benefit in patients with chronic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>The randomized controlled IMAC trial of 62 patients with recent-onset (&le;6 months of symptoms) DCM with LVEF &le;40 percent found that the improvement in LV function was the same with IVIG (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day for two days) and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Eleven percent of patients had &quot;Dallas criteria&quot; positive myocarditis. At one year, both groups of patients did well as the LVEF rose from 25 percent at baseline to 42 percent. Thirty-six percent had a normal LVEF, and the transplant-free survival at one and two years was 92 and 88 percent.

Among the 11 patients, there was only one death and two transplantations during one-year follow-up.
