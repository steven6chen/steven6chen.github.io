The distinctive overlap features of SLE, SSc, and PM commonly appear sequentially over time. Thus, in its early stages, MCTD is often referred to as an undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

In a 2011 nationwide study in Norway, the prevalence of MCTD was 3.8 per 100,000 adults, with an incidence of 2.1 per million per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. MCTD is much more common in women than in men, although estimates of the difference range widely (from a ratio of 3.3:1 to up to 16:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early clinical features of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) are nonspecific and may consist of general malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, and low-grade fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A specific clue that these symptoms are caused by a connective tissue disease is the discovery of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) in association with the Raynaud phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As will be described below, almost any organ system can be involved in MCTD.

Myalgia is a common symptom in patients with the MCTD syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In most patients, there are no demonstrable weaknesses, electromyographic (EMG) abnormalities, or elevation of muscle enzymes. It is often unclear whether the symptom represents a low-grade myositis, a physical deconditioning, or an associated fibromyalgia syndrome. However, a true myositis may occur as an acute flare against a background of general disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Cases of a low-grade, insidious, and persistent inflammatory myopathy have also been described. The histology of muscle involvement in MCTD is the same as that of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], with features of both the vascular involvement of dermatomyositis and the cell-mediated changes of PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. It is increasingly apparent that a diagnosis of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; PM is relatively rare, and most patients with an inflammatory myopathy turn out to have an overlap syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac involvement accounts for approximately 20 percent of MCTD mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

These features commonly appear sequentially over time, and it often takes several years before enough overlapping features have appeared to be confident that MCTD is the most appropriate diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early clinical features of MCTD are nonspecific and may include general malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, and low-grade fever. A positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) in association with the Raynaud phenomenon may point to a connective tissue disease diagnosis. MCTD is much more common in women, and most patients present in the second or third decade of life. Sun exposure is not a precipitating factor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost any organ system can be involved in MCTD. The clinical features that point to a diagnosis of MCTD include the Raynaud phenomenon, swollen hands, puffy fingers, the absence of severe renal and central nervous system (CNS) disease, prominent arthritis, and the insidious onset of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) (not related to lung fibrosis). The progressive development of this clinical picture along with a high titer speckled ANA with a fine specificity to anti-U1 RNP (especially the 68 kD protein) is highly suggestive of a MCTD diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint involvement in MCTD is more common and frequently more severe than in classic SLE, with an obvious arthritis in about 60 percent of patients. Hand deformity, with Jaccoud&rsquo;s arthropathy-like changes, and small marginal erosions may occur, but severe destructive arthritis is infrequent. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the three overlap features required for the diagnosis of MCTD is an inflammatory myopathy clinically and histologically identical to PM. Myalgia is a common symptom, but in most patients there are no demonstrable weaknesses, electromyographic (EMG) abnormalities, or elevation of muscle enzymes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Myositis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lungs are commonly affected in MCTD, with involvement in about 75 percent of patients from any of a wide spectrum of pulmonary problems. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs in 50 to 66 percent of patients. PAH is a major cause of death, and the early detection of PAH is important. Echocardiography is the most useful screening test for PAH. Early symptoms that should alert one to pulmonary involvement are dry cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H20979128\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20980015\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial lung disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20980022\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis is the most common clinical manifestation of cardiac involvement, being reported in up to 40 percent of patients. Other cardiac manifestations include myocardial involvement, usually secondary to PAH, as well as conduction abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disordered motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract is the most common clinical overlap feature with SSc, occurring in about 60 to 80 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of severe renal disease is a hallmark of MCTD, although some degree of renal involvement occurs in about 25 percent of patients. Membranous nephropathy is the most common finding. Severe CNS involvement is also uncommon; approximately 25 percent of patients have some mild CNS involvement, such as trigeminal neuropathy, headache, or sensorineural hearing loss. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific hematologic and serologic abnormalities are common in MCTD, including anemia, leukopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. A high titer speckled ANA whose fine specificity is anti-U1 RNP is the emblematic serological finding in MCTD. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are common in MCTD patients with prominent joint involvement. Antiphospholipid antibodies occur less frequently than in SLE and are not associated with thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spontaneous abortions. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic and laboratory abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raynaud phenomenon is a prototypical early feature of MCTD; it is associated with abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy similar to that seen in SSc. The characteristic vascular lesion of MCTD is bland intimal proliferation and medial hypertrophy affecting medium- and small-sized vessels. The effects of pregnancy on the course of MCTD and the effects of MCTD on the fetus are uncertain.
