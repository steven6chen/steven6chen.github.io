Although femoral vein cannulation is often considered less desirable due to higher complication rates, the femoral veins remain a reliable central venous access site, particularly under urgent or emergent circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

With contemporary skin preparation and proper routine catheter maintenance, infection rates appear to be comparable to other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. A meta-analysis suggests there is no longer a demonstrable difference in infection risk based upon catheter position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, short-term use does not completely eliminate the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which can occur within one day of cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H58340727\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>The femoral veins are frequently preferred when other access sites are exhausted or there is increased risk for complications such as with emergency access, coagulopathy, and in the uncooperative patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The femoral veins are generally easier to cannulate and provide dependable access for less-experienced operators, or when there is concern for arterial injury at upper extremity sites because of altered local anatomy. Caution is needed when this approach is used in pulseless patients because chest compressions can produce femoral venous pulsations that may be misinterpreted as arterial. Catheter misplacement at the femoral site occurs in up to 30 percent of cardiac arrest resuscitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Femoral venous access is also used for the delivery of most inferior vena cava filters, and for lower extremity venous intervention.

Compared with subclavian and jugular access sites, the femoral veins may be preferred in the face of coagulopathy due to the ability to provide direct pressure at this access site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1382365406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Femoral access versus other sites'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3099795\"><span class=\"h1\">FEMORAL VEIN ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The femoral vein is the major deep vein of the lower extremity. The vessel traverses the thigh and takes a superficial course at the femoral triangle before passing beneath the inguinal ligament into the pelvis as the external iliac vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51298%7EEM%2F65123\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51298 graphicRef65123 \">figure 1A-B</a>). The hip joint and psoas muscle lie directly beneath the femoral neurovascular bundle at the level of the inguinal ligament.</p><p>Within the femoral triangle, the common femoral vein is enclosed within the femoral sheath where it lies medial to the femoral artery. The common femoral vein receives several tributaries within this region, including the great saphenous and anterior saphenous veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 \">figure 2</a>). These veins can be inadvertently cannulated during the procedure and initially misinterpreted as femoral vein cannulation. Lower extremity venous anatomy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders&quot;, section on 'Anatomy (The &quot;A&quot; component of CEAP)'</a>.)</p><p>The femoral artery provides a useful landmark to guide needle access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56646 \">picture 1</a>). The midinguinal point lying half-way between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle marks a location just lateral to the femoral artery and provides an important reference point during cardiac arrest or in the absence of a palpable femoral pulse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66432 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3099802\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General considerations for patient preparation, including catheter and access site selection, monitoring and sedation, measures to control infection, and consent, are discussed elsewhere.

For tunneled catheters and other devices, the steps are similar except that a sheath is placed over the guidewire, and the catheter (or other device such as pacemaker leads, filter) is placed through the sheath, which is then removed. </p><p>Prior to the placement of femoral venous catheters, assemble the following equipment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound machine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound machine preparation'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile ultrasound transducer gel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central line kit with intravenous catheter (size and length based upon diameter and depth of vein)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile drapes, gloves, gown, surgical mask, and cap </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical antiseptic (eg, 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> solution) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H24969720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin antisepsis'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isotonic saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heparin for flushing the catheter </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transparent adhesive dressing, tape</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous tubing and connectors (eg, needleless Luer connector, three-way stopcock)</p><p/><p>Although any length central venous catheter can be used at the femoral site, longer (20 to 24 cm) catheters are needed for hemodialysis to achieve placement in the inferior vena cava to provide adequate flow during hemodialysis.</p><p>The proper functioning of any fluoroscopic equipment should be verified. Fluoroscopy is rarely needed for femoral venous access to place implanted catheters, but is necessary for placing inferior vena cava filters or other venous devices (eg, venous stents), and may be useful when altered venous anatomy is encountered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662980389\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For femoral venous access, a wide skin preparation encompasses the anterior and medial surfaces of the proximal thigh and extends superior to the inguinal ligament. Hair should be clipped from the access site prior to skin preparation. Clipping is preferred to shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A chlorhexidine-alcohol skin antiseptic solution should be applied to the access site and allowed to dry prior to draping the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An additional preparation kit may be required for those that contain only iodine solutions, as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> skin antisepsis is superior at reducing short-term catheter-related infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H564183335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Insertion site preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58340216\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correct positioning facilitates vein cannulation. </p><p>The clinician should position the patient's bed or procedure table at a comfortable height. The procedure is generally performed while standing on the same side as the access site. Alternatively, some operators reach across the patient to cannulate the contralateral femoral vein (eg, right-handed operator cannulating the left femoral vein from the patient's right side). </p><p>The patient should be positioned supine. The target leg can be abducted and externally rotated 15 degrees to open the femoral triangle. Elevation of the buttock with rolled sheets or a firm pillow facilitates exposure in some patients. </p><p>Most patients can be safely positioned supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, critically ill and obese patients may develop respiratory compromise in the supine position and require close monitoring. Head-up positioning (ie, reverse Trendelenburg) may augment the cross-sectional area of the femoral vein, but the effect is not universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Reverse Trendelenburg may be contraindicated in patients with volume depletion. Some patients may require anesthesia with a controlled airway for safe placement of central venous catheters and devices.

The use of ultrasound significantly increased the success rate on first attempt in a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and may increase overall success rates and decrease complications, particularly inadvertent arterial puncture.

The target venipuncture site is just inferior to the inguinal ligament where the common femoral vein lies superficial and medial to the artery. Compression should be minimized or released prior to attempted venipuncture. Cooperative patients can also be asked to hum or perform a Valsalva maneuver to augment venous diameter.</p><p>The femoral vein can be cannulated using the access needle with or without the aid of a finder needle or using an angiocatheter (catheter-over-needle combination). The technique for each of these is described below. In general, the needle should be oriented with the bevel up and be introduced at an angle of 20 to 30&deg; to the skin. For an anatomic approach, insert the needle 1 to 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament and just medial to the femoral artery. The vessel is normally reached within 2 to 4 cm but may be deeper in obese or edematous patients. If unsuccessful, perform systematic needle passes medial to lateral (while maintaining continuous negative pressure) until the common femoral vein is located. We prefer to use a finder needle under this circumstance. Take care not to push the needle into the periosteum of the pubic tubercle medially as a tissue or bone plug can occlude the lumen of the needle.</p><p>Isolated arterial needle puncture is one of the most common complications of venous access but is typically uneventful if recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Confirmation that the needle or angiocatheter is in the vein is essential prior to dilating the subcutaneous tissue and vein. (See <a href=\"#H662985603\" class=\"local\">'Venous confirmation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is a learning curve for central venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Experienced operators enjoy greater success rates with fewer complications. Among both experienced and inexperienced operators, an increased number of introducer needle passes correlates with increased complication rates, which are significantly higher after two to three unsuccessful passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If two attempts have been made, the needle should be completely removed the landmarks reassessed, a new access site chosen, or assistance obtained from a more experienced clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/3,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3592328028\"><span class=\"h3\">Access with introducer needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To access the femoral vein with the introducer needle:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the introducer needle (18 gauge) into the skin and apply continuous negative pressure by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe. It is helpful to have a small amount of saline in the syringe to minimize the formation of thrombus. Penetration into the vein will go unrecognized unless negative pressure is applied, but only a small amount of continuous negative pressure is needed (approximately 1 cc of a 10-cc syringe) during forward advancement of the needle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many instances, the introducer needle compresses, but does not puncture, the compliant vein wall.

This technique minimizes injury in the event of inadvertent arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. </p><p>To use a finder needle to aid introducer needle placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above for large-bore needle access, insert the finder needle while applying negative suction on the plunger of the syringe; more suction will be required (approximately 2 to 3 cc of a 10-cc syringe).

Alternatively, remove the syringe leaving the finder needle in place to anchor the vessel and provide a guide for venous access by the introducer needle.

Bright red and high-pressure pulsatile bleeding are important but imperfect clues to arterial puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], which can occur, although less frequently, with ultrasound-guided access. Moreover, the absence of these signs is not perfectly reliable for excluding inadvertent arterial puncture. Dark, nonpulsatile backflow of blood may be seen with arterial puncture in the face of oxygen desaturation, hypotension, or needle malposition. If there is any doubt, the needle's location can be confirmed by pressure transduction. As an alternative, a blood gas can be drawn from the accessed venous site and compared with an arterial sample; however, blood gas analysis is more time consuming.</p><p>To transduce the blood pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the needle directly to the pressure tubing system </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, replace the needle over a guidewire with a 6 cm, 18-gauge single-lumen transduction catheter (without any intervening dilation). Connect the transduction catheter to a pressure line and transducer and evaluate the pressure and waveform tracings on the monitor. Typical venous waveforms should be seen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a pressure transduction system is not available, attach a short length of saline-filled intravenous tubing to the needle and extended it vertically to measure the pressure, which should be &lt;10 cm in height, and should demonstrate respiratory variation. </p><p/><p>In addition to blood pressure transduction, echocardiography of saline flushed through the catheter can reportedly confirm intravenous access (ie, the FLUSH test). Using this technique, agitated saline is infused through the line while imaging the heart through a subxiphoid window. If atrial opacification can be demonstrated this confirms venous access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>If the femoral artery has inadvertently been punctured, which is not uncommon, withdraw the needle and apply pressure over the site for 5 to 10 minutes after which venous access can be re-attempted. Inadvertent dilation and cannulation of the femoral artery with a standard catheter does not usually pose a significant problem. However, larger bore catheters, such as dialysis catheters, may be associated with bleeding or vascular complications such as arterial thrombosis and embolization. If catheterization of the right atrium with a large bore catheter is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular consultation obtained. This should also be considered in patients with standard catheters inadvertently placed into the femoral artery of coagulopathic patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662981202\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER PLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most catheters and other central venous devices are placed using the Seldinger method, which refers to the use of a guidewire placed into a vessel to provide a conduit for intravascular device placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Seldinger first described the guidewire technique for arterial cannulation in 1953, and it was subsequently adopted for venous access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662981333\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidewire handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the femoral vein has been successfully accessed, a guidewire is advanced through the needle or angiocatheter.</p><p>Multiple types of wires are available to assist with venous access procedures. The most commonly used wire for initial venous access is a flexible J-tip guidewire, favored because it negotiates curvatures and avoids vessel trauma during passage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82419 \">picture 5</a>). Longer guidewires are used to place inferior vena cava filters and other venous devices (eg, stents), and, at times, more specialized wires (eg, hydrophilic) may be needed.</p><p>The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily thorough the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Methods to address resistance to guidewire advancement or withdrawal are discussed below. </p><p>To place the guidewire:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position the tapered plastic introducer to straighten the distal J-tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72306\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72306 \">picture 6</a>). The orientation of the bevel tip of the introducer needle and the J-tip of the wire can help facilitate the direction of wire placement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain the residual length of guidewire (50 cm standard length) under constant manual control to maintain sterility and avoid its loss off the operating field. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the guidewire only as far as needed to allow passage of the catheter over the wire. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Never forcefully advance the guidewire, as this can kink and permanently deform the wire, and risk vessel injury. The guidewire should always pass smoothly and easily thorough the needle, dilator, or catheter without resistance. Resistance to guidewire passage can be due to needle dislodgement, compression of the guidewire against the vessel wall, or anatomic obstruction. Rotating the needle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guidewire to reorient the bevel or J-tip may relieve impingement of the guidewire on the posterior vessel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If resistance persists, remove the guidewire and aspirate blood to confirm intraluminal needle position. Reducing the angle of the needle against the skin may facilitate guidewire passage. Once the guidewire is positioned, hold it firmly in place, and remove the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance during guidewire withdrawal can be managed by simultaneously removing the needle and indwelling wire. Continued resistance may indicate entrapment and warrants diagnostic radiography to evaluate the wire appearance and position. A guidewire that resists removal (eg, kinked) should <strong>never</strong> be withdrawn through the needle because the wire can be sheared off by the needle, allowing the wire to embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527628095\"><span class=\"h2\">Tract dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central venous catheters are substantially larger caliber than the needle and guidewire used for venous access. Dilation of the subcutaneous tissue tract is required for catheter insertion and is accomplished by threading a single stiff tapered dilator or series of dilators over the wire to expand the subcutaneous tissue and vein. The skin and fascia catheter tract should be dilated carefully with gentle pressure. Only the soft tissue and vein wall need to be dilated. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risk traumatic vein injury. </p><p>To place the dilator:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the guidewire is in place, make a controlled 3 mm stab incision made in the skin at the entry site with a #11 blade to prevent the dilator from catching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the stiff tapered dilator over the wire, making certain the guidewire does not advance and is not pulled out at the skin exit site. The guidewire and dilator should <strong>never</strong> be advanced as a single unit, to avoid venous injury. The wire should serve as an immobile monorail over which the dilator (or catheter) is passed. Redundant tissue at the femoral site may require slight caudad skin traction to avoid kinking the wire during dilator advancement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the wire just above the dilator hub, grasp the dilator just above its tip, and push it over the guidewire with a firm corkscrew motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77656\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77656 \">picture 7</a>). Mild resistance is normal. Excessive resistance may represent an inadequate skin incision, a malpositioned guidewire, or guidewire or dilator deformation. Kinking of the guidewire against the dilator is associated with vessel trauma and puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As described above with needle placement, the opening of the dilator (or <span class=\"nowrap\">dilator/sheath</span> combination) should be covered and the patient encouraged to Valsalva to prevent entry of air. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the dilator only to the anticipated depth of the femoral vein, <strong>not</strong> the entire length of the dilator. Withdraw the dilator while maintaining the guidewire position within the vessel. Apply direct pressure to the exit site to maintain hemostasis prior to catheter insertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steady traction on the wire during soft-tissue dilatation helps prevent wire kinking. Rotating the dilator during advancement often facilitates tract dilatation (round dilators only). If resistance is met, it may be related to a kink in the wire which can be remedied by advancing the wire deeper or withdrawing the kink into the dilator. Overzealous efforts and guidewire kinking (especially with stiff dilators) risks traumatic vein injury.</p><p/><p>Many indwelling tunneled femoral catheters are placed through a peel-away sheath. To place these devices, a dilator-sheath combination is placed over the wire after the tract has been dilated. The dilator and wire are removed and the catheter is placed through the sheath. Once the catheter is in place, the sheath is peeled away from the catheter and discarded. The dilator-sheath combination for large-bore tunneled catheters is stiff and placement is facilitated with fluoroscopy, which allows imaging of the tip of the dilator and sheath, ensuring that it is placed no further into the vein than is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3099809\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662984425\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning the catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the subcutaneous tissues and vein have been dilated, the catheter is placed over the wire and positioned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70002 \">picture 8</a>). </p><p>To place and position the catheter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thread the guidewire back through the end-hole of the catheter until it emerges from the distal port, and advance the catheter over the wire into the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51314 \">picture 9</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to catheter advancement can be overcome by simultaneously advancing the catheter and wire together, but only for a short distance, otherwise vein laceration can result. Withdrawal of the catheter and redilation of the tract is preferred. </p><p/><p>Femoral venous catheters should be placed between 15 and 30 cm deep for correct positioning of the tip of the catheter in the inferior vena cava, but the depth depends upon the size of the patient. For hemodialysis catheters, flow rate through the catheter is the most important factor. Good flow rates can often be achieved with a femoral catheter tip that resides in the common iliac vein. Standard length (15 to 20 cm) non-tunneled hemodialysis catheters will extend to that level from the femoral position of most patients. However, when placing tunneled femoral catheters for longer-term use (eg, Permacath), flow rates are often better maintained with catheters extending more centrally into the inferior vena cava. Longer catheters (up to 45 cm) are available for this purpose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85547786\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter flushing and fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the catheter is in place, the proper function of the catheter should be confirmed by aspirating blood and subsequently flushing each port with saline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56646 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>]. The catheter should then be sutured into place. </p><p>The catheter should then be secured using 2-0 or 3-0 nylon or silk sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58552 \">picture 10</a>). If more than 2 cm of catheter remains exposed, it can be sutured to the skin or to a separate catheter anchor that is often included in the catheter kit. A transparent dressing should be placed over the catheter exit site to protect it from contamination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662983898\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMATION OF FEMORAL CATHETER POSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike subclavian and jugular venous catheters, femoral venous catheters (non-tunneled and tunneled) can be used immediately. A postprocedure abdominal film can be performed to confirm the correct catheter course and tip position if the catheter is not functioning properly. Although it may be acceptable to have the tip of the catheter residing in the iliac vein for short-term use, the distal tip of femoral catheters should generally be located above the confluence of the iliac veins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1232392311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of catheter tip positioning'</a>.)</p><p>In neonates and pediatric patients, ultrasound can be used to assist in gaining venous access as well as evaluating catheter tip position in the IVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This obviates need for fluoroscopy in a radiosensitive population and facilitates bedside catheter insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a femoral catheter tip is positioned too proximally (eg, into a renal vein), it can be repositioned at the bedside using sterile technique. The sutures are removed and the catheter withdrawn and resutured into place. If a catheter is not in far enough or is misplaced into the contralateral iliac vein, it should be replaced over a guidewire under sterile conditions when convenient. Although this placement may not be deemed as ideal, the catheter can remain in the contralateral iliac vein for short-term use if the catheter is functioning well. It is important to remember that the portion of a catheter left out of the body is unsterile and should never be advanced into the patient, not even if it is under a sterile dressing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58343377\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of central catheters is discussed elsewhere.

Although femoral site cannulation is often recommended as a secondary site due to higher rates of delayed complications, the femoral veins remain a dependable venous access site. (See <a href=\"#H3099774\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For femoral venous cannulation, the patient should be positioned supine with the target leg abducted and externally rotated. Elevation of the buttock may facilitate exposure in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H58340216\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When equipment and expertise are available, children and adults undergoing femoral line placement should have the procedure guided by ultrasonography rather than using landmark techniques alone. Ultrasound guidance improves initial cannulation success. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access#H1232393340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;, section on 'Femoral vein'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral artery puncture during attempted femoral vein localization is not uncommon and can be managed by withdrawing the needle and applying pressure over the site for 5 to 10 minutes, after which venous access can be re-attempted. Inadvertent dilation and cannulation of the femoral artery with a standard catheter does not usually pose significant problems. However, larger bore catheters, such as dialysis catheters, may be associated with bleeding or vascular complications such as arterial thrombosis and embolization. If arterial catheterization with a large bore catheter is confirmed, the catheter should be left in place and a vascular surgery consult obtained.
