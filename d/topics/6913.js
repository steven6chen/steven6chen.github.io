Although SCLC is highly responsive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), it commonly relapses within months despite treatment.</p><p>Since SCLC usually presents with disseminated disease, treatment strategies have focused on systemic chemotherapy. Although this has resulted in significant improvements in survival for patients with both limited- and extensive-stage disease, the long-term prognosis remains poor.</p><p>Attempts to further improve survival with chemotherapy have included the evaluation of higher-dose therapy including bone marrow transplantation, dose-dense regimens, alternating non-cross resistant treatments and novel cytotoxic agents. However, these approaches have not resulted in major advances in the treatment of SCLC in more than twenty years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensive-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensive stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Increased dose intensity'</a>.)</p><p>Investigational approaches for the treatment of SCLC will be reviewed here.
