In Latin, the word &quot;torus&quot; means &quot;twisted&quot; and &quot;collum&quot; means &quot;neck&quot;. </p><p>The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) takes origin from two tendons (one from the manubrium sterni and one from the medial third of the clavicle) that combine to form a single muscle bundle running in the neck superiorly and posteriorly to insert onto the ipsilateral mastoid process of the temporal bone and the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone. Central to many but not all cases of torticollis is shortening or spasm of a SCM muscle that causes the abnormal posturing with variable degrees of neck flexion or extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Describing a child as having a &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; torticollis can result in confusion among providers, since some may be referring to the pathologic SCM muscle and others to the direction in which either the head and ear is tilted or the chin is rotated. To avoid this, we recommend that torticollis be described in terms of the direction of both head and ear tilt AND chin rotation (eg, torticollis with head tilt to the left and chin rotation to the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89489 \">picture 1</a>)).</p><p>Torticollis may occur in congenital and acquired forms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital torticollis</strong> &ndash; Congenital torticollis, the most common type of torticollis, usually arises from muscular fibrosis of the SCM muscle and less commonly from neurologic or bony abnormalities. Facial asymmetry is often present in children who have congenital torticollis, but rarely in those with acquired torticollis, and is sometimes used to distinguish the two types. Congenital torticollis is more common than acquired torticollis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-muscular-torticollis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital muscular torticollis: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-muscular-torticollis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital muscular torticollis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired torticollis</strong> &ndash; In children, acquired torticollis typically results from SCM or trapezius muscle injury or inflammation. A wide variety of conditions can also cause torticollis due to cervical muscle spasm or cervical nerve irritation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76604 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p>Acquired torticollis due to primary SCM spasm should result in the chin rotated to the side contralateral to the spastic SCM and the ear ipsilateral to the spastic SCM tilted to the shoulder. Other causes of acquired torticollis, such as C1-C2 (atlantoaxial) rotary subluxation can present with SCM spasm on the side to which the chin is tilted, as if trying to correct the deformity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681537\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681587\"><span class=\"h2\">Retropharyngeal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various respiratory and soft tissue infections of the neck may cause acquired torticollis in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76604 \">table 1</a>). Among these, retropharyngeal abscess is one of the most common serious infections described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Retropharyngeal abscess occurs most commonly in children between the ages of two and four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Unwillingness to move the neck because of discomfort is a prominent presenting feature. Limitation of neck extension, with use of eye movement for upward gaze, is particularly suggestive of retropharyngeal abscess. Additional signs and symptoms of retropharyngeal abscess include fever, irritability, dysphagia, drooling, odynophagia, and respiratory distress (stridor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachypnea). Retropharyngeal abscess is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681667\"><span class=\"h2\">Suppurative jugular thrombophlebitis (Lemierre syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppurative jugular thrombophlebitis (also known as Lemierre syndrome or postanginal sepsis) should be suspected in patients with antecedent pharyngitis, septic pulmonary emboli, and persistent fever despite antimicrobial therapy. It is caused most commonly by Fusobacterium necrophorum, which is often present in the bloodstream. Patients typically present acutely with fever (&gt;39&deg;C) and rigors, often accompanied by respiratory distress. Most patients have localized neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> throat pain. Clinical examination of the oropharynx may demonstrate ulceration, a pseudomembrane, or erythema. Tenderness, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> induration may be observed overlying the jugular vein, over the angle of the jaw or along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sternocleidomastoid muscle irritation may cause torticollis. High resolution computed tomography of the neck with contrast provides the most definitive visualization of the presence and extent of the jugular thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis&quot;, section on 'Jugular vein'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681659\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spine injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical spine fractures and subluxations are rare in children under the age of eight years. When present, they typically involve the upper cervical spine, and occur in the setting of high kinetic energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions and falls. Similar to adults, older children and adolescents are vulnerable to lower cervical spine trauma caused by motor vehicle collisions and sports injuries. Signs of cervical spine injury can include neck pain, tenderness, torticollis, and stiffness. While some children with fractures of the cervical spine are unresponsive at the time of evaluation, many are awake, alert and verbal, complaining of neck pain, and have no demonstrable neurologic deficit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-musculoskeletal-neck-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681675\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal epidural hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous or traumatic epidural hematoma of the cervical spine is rare but may occur even after apparently minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], after a neurosurgical procedure, or spontaneously, especially in patients with hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It should be considered in patients with the abrupt onset of unexplained neck pain, torticollis and weakness or other neurologic findings. Emergency neurosurgical consultation and surgical decompression are indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Spinal epidural hematoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681683\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain tumors located in the posterior fossa, although a rare cause of torticollis, may present with head tilt, neck stiffness, or torticollis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Associated symptoms may include vomiting, headache, ataxia, vision disturbances, papilledema, or cranial nerve deficits. Head tilt may also result from attempts to compensate for diplopia. However, neck stiffness is believed to result from irritation of the accessory nerve by the cerebellar tonsils trapped in the occipital foramen or by tonsillar herniation. Thus, any patient with torticollis should have a thorough neurologic examination, and a posterior fossa tumor should be considered in a patient with headache, vomiting, focal neurological deficits, or torticollis that does not resolve over several days with conservative measures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681748\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5681756\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle injury or inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury or inflammation involving the sternocleidomastoid or trapezius muscles is the most common cause of acquired torticollis in children. As an example, in an observational study of 170 children with neck complaints and stiffness evaluated in a pediatric emergency department, muscle contusion, spontaneous torticollis, or viral myositis was diagnosed in approximately 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Clinical manifestations typically consist of minor trauma, viral illness, or no specific history followed by an abrupt onset of torticollis, often noted when the child awakens from sleep. Torticollis is frequently accompanied by neck pain and distress. Local tenderness of the sternocleidomastoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trapezius muscles are present and cervical spine range of motion is limited. Examination of the pharynx, cervical lymph nodes, and nervous system and plain radiographs of the cervical spine are normal. Muscular torticollis typically resolves within one week with supportive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385196\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute infections with compensatory muscle spasm or referred pain are the second leading cause of acquired torticollis in children accounting for 20 percent of neck complaints in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The most common infections associated with torticollis comprise viral or streptococcal pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, retropharyngeal abscess, parapharyngeal abscess, and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Retropharyngeal abscess is considered life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H5681587\" class=\"local\">'Retropharyngeal abscess'</a> above.) </p><p>Less common infectious etiologies include, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], diskitis, tuberculosis (Pott disease), and right upper lobe pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76604 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Children with infectious conditions causing torticollis frequently have fever with other signs of infection (eg, exudative pharyngitis, cervical spine tenderness, or tender and enlarged lymph nodes). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation (AARS), a rotational displacement of C1 on C2, is thought to be caused by retropharyngeal edema that leads to laxity of the ligaments and capsular structures at the atlantoaxial level and permits rotary deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nontraumatic atlantoaxial subluxation is sometimes called Grisel syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59495 \">image 2</a>). </p><p>Children between 6 and 12 years of age are affected most frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pathoanatomy of AARS is poorly understood. There may even be different pathoanatomies associated with different etiologies. In some cases, there appears to be no motion between C1 and C2, similar perhaps to other synovial joints such as the knee &quot;locked&quot; in one position. In other cases, motion is present but limited. AARS may occur after minor trauma, pharyngeal surgery (eg, tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy), an inflammatory process of the neck (causing spasm of the SCM), or upper respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36770146\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children present with pain, torticollis, and decreased range of motion following minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or infection of the head and neck. In contrast to congenital muscular torticollis, the head tilts away from the affected SCM muscle so that the SCM muscle on the &quot;chin&quot; side is tight and tender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89489 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>]. Children with atlantoaxial rotary subluxation also may have tenderness of the spinous process of the axis, displacement of the spine of the axis to the same side as the torticollis, reduction in the size of the nasopharynx, and a change in nasal resonance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, because a portion of the second cervical nerve (which innervates the occipital dermatome) runs in the capsule of the atlantoaxial joint, they may complain of unilateral occipital pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of atlantoaxial subluxation includes abnormalities of the upper spine (eg, fractures, tumors, and osteomyelitis), and tumors of the posterior fossa or spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Cervical spine immobilization and cervical radiographs are warranted, particularly when there is a clear traumatic mechanism of injury. In addition, cervical spine radiographs should be obtained in patients who have conditions that are associated with atlantoaxial instability (eg, Down syndrome, Morquio syndrome, Larsen syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and cervical spine arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-38</a>]. Torticollis or neck pain in patients with these conditions, particularly when associated with neurologic symptoms (eg, gait abnormalities, clumsiness, change in bowel or bladder habits, hyperreflexia) may indicate spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/32,33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,39</a>]. The cervical spine should be immobilized before imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic evaluation demonstrates asymmetry of the odontoid in relation to the atlas[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Open-mouth views of the odontoid demonstrate the best view, but may be difficult to obtain because the limited range of motion prevents proper positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Dynamic CT, with the head turned (actively, never passively) as far as possible to the right and to the left, may be necessary to verify the subluxation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89489 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36770153\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for atlantoaxial subluxation depends upon the severity and duration of the abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For acute (less than one week in duration) and minor cases, soft cervical collar, rest, and analgesics may be adequate. For severe cases, cervical traction followed by immobilization and surgical intervention may be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].

The presence of all three features is not necessary for diagnosis; head nodding and nystagmus are most common, with head turn in only 30 percent. The age at onset is usually 6 to 12 months, but can be up to several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The periodic episodes of torticollis can randomly alternate from side to side. The individual attacks typically last for hours, but occasionally last for days. The episodes occur less frequently as the child gets older and disappear in most cases by five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of benign paroxysmal torticollis has not been determined. It is considered to be a &quot;migraine equivalent&quot; disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Some patients go on to develop migraine headaches or benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Electromyographics studies in one infant demonstrated continuous electrical discharges over the sternocleidomastoid muscle during the episodes, indicating that the torticollis was a dynamic phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Benign paroxysmal torticollis is occasionally confused with congenital muscular torticollis. However, in contrast to congenital muscular torticollis, the torticollis is usually accompanied by vomiting, pallor, irritability, ataxia, or drowsiness. The associated findings can mimic seizures or posterior fossa tumors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) or neuroimaging may be necessary to exclude these disorders. The EEG is usually normal in patients with benign paroxysmal torticollis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-torticollis-in-children/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>].

Important questions to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old is the child? &ndash; Retropharyngeal abscess, ocular torticollis, benign paroxysmal torticollis, spasmus nutans, and Sandifer syndrome from gastroesophageal reflux disease are most commonly seen in infants and young children.
