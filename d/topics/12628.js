An overview of the approach to therapy of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women will be presented here.

Lifestyle measures include adequate calcium and vitamin D, exercise, smoking cessation, counseling on fall prevention, and avoidance of heavy alcohol use. In addition, affected patients should avoid, if possible, drugs that increase bone loss, such as glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium/vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An optimal diet for treatment (or prevention) of osteoporosis includes an adequate intake of calories (to avoid malnutrition), calcium, and vitamin D.</p><p>Postmenopausal women who are getting adequate calcium from dietary intake alone (approximately 1200 mg daily) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>) do not need to take calcium supplements. Women with inadequate dietary intake should take supplemental elemental calcium (generally 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> in divided doses at mealtime, such that their total calcium intake (diet plus supplements) approximates 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78814 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is considerable controversy around the effects of calcium supplements on the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Women should also ingest a total of 800 international units of vitamin D daily. Higher doses are required if they have malabsorption or rapid metabolism of vitamin D due to concomitant anticonvulsant drug therapy. Most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis require vitamin D supplementation as it is difficult to achieve goals with diet alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77982 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>Data on the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D replacement for osteoporosis are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data on the impact of protein intake on bone density are conflicting. While some studies suggest that higher protein intake may be associated with a lower risk of hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>], others suggest that high protein intake may increase bone resorption and calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, given the conflicting data, we do not recommend modifying protein intake as a strategy for preventing bone loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with osteoporosis (or who are seeking to prevent it) should exercise (prudently) for at least 30 minutes three times per week. In prospective cohort studies, exercise was associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 10 trials, exercise reduced the occurrence of overall fractures in older adults (4.8 versus 10.9 percent in the control group; relative risk [RR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The reduction in vertebral fractures was not statistically significant (three trials, 18 versus 30 percent; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.30-1.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This may be related to the small number of patients included in the vertebral fracture trials.</p><p>Exercise also has beneficial effects on BMD in premenopausal and postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A meta-analysis of 43 randomized trials (4320 participants) of exercise and BMD in postmenopausal women showed a significant positive effect of exercise on BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) (mean difference 0.85, 95% CI 0.62-1.07) and trochanter (mean difference 1.03, 95% CI 0.56-1.49) compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A variety of exercise types, including resistance training, jogging, jumping, and walking, was effective. The most effective type of exercise for BMD of the femoral neck was non-weight-bearing, high-force exercise (eg, progressive resistance strength training), whereas a combined program (mixture of more than one exercise type) was most effective for LS BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The meta-analysis was limited by loss to follow-up and the poor quality of allocation concealment and blinding.</p><p>Overall, the beneficial effect of exercise on bone density is small. However, these changes reflect areal BMD measurements. It is still uncertain how long-term exercise affects other measures of bone architecture. Therefore, if exercise does reduce the risk of fracture, it may relate to changes in parameters other than areal bone mass or to increased muscular strength and decreased risk of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no convincing evidence that high-intensity exercise, such as running, is of greater benefit than lower intensity exercise, such as walking. Because enjoyment of the regimen is important (the benefits of exercise are quickly lost after the woman stops exercising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]), we recommend that women pick a regular weight-bearing exercise regimen that they enjoy to facilitate long-term compliance. Excessive exercise in premenopausal women may lead to weight loss and amenorrhea, thereby causing osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cessation of smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We strongly recommend smoking cessation to all women concerned with their skeletal health, because smoking cigarettes accelerates bone loss. One study, as an example, evaluated female twins who were discordant for smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Smoking one pack per day throughout adult life was associated with a 5 to 10 percent reduction in bone density. Smoking may also negate the beneficial effect of estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This may be mediated in part by acceleration of the metabolism of estrogen, thereby lowering serum estrogen concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26368742\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a growing interest in other nonpharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis. In animal models, mechanical stimulation from vibration produced anabolic effects on cancellous and cortical bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Although whole-body vibration platforms have been proposed as a nonpharmacologic therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, the available data from randomized trials show minimal to no improvement in BMD with the use of whole body vibration platforms when compared with sham vibration, walking, or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In most trials, data were evaluated per protocol, rather than intention to treat. None of the trials evaluated fracture outcomes. In addition, the safety of vibration therapy in older patients has not been carefully examined. Thus, there are insufficient data to recommend this therapy in postmenopausal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11555730\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to lifestyle measures, patients at high risk for fracture should receive pharmacologic therapy. Our recommendations for initiation of therapy are largely in agreement with the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommendations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52512 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Patients with the highest risk of fracture are the ones most likely to benefit from drug therapy.</p><p>Fracture risk is determined by a combination of BMD and clinical risk factors. Particular attention should be paid to treating women with a recent fracture, including hip fracture, because they are at high risk for a second fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11555759\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2008, a World Health Organization (WHO) task force introduced FRAX, which estimates the 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures combined (hip, spine, shoulder, or wrist) for an untreated patient using femoral neck BMD and easily obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 5</a>). The technical aspects of FRAX are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a>.)</p><p>The NOF released revised osteoporosis treatment and prevention guidelines based upon FRAX in conjunction with an updated United States-specific economic analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52512 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The revised guidelines are similar to previous treatment recommendations.</p><p>The NOF recommends treatment of postmenopausal women (and men &ge;50 years) with a history of hip or vertebral fracture or with osteoporosis based upon BMD measurement (T-score &le;-2.5). These recommendations are widely accepted, and clinical trial data support the use of bisphosphonates to prevent fracture in such individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Bisphosphonates'</a>.)</p><p>The guidelines also provide specific treatment recommendations for postmenopausal women with osteopenia on BMD (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5). In these individuals, the model suggests that treatment is cost effective when the 10-year probability of hip fracture reaches 3 percent or the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures combined is &ge;20 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52512 \">table 4</a>). These criteria were chosen on the basis of a United States-specific economic analysis, and they have not been assessed in clinical trials.</p><p>The 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture can be calculated for individual patients using the <a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2064\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX website</a> (click on &quot;Calculation Tool&quot; and select country). The FRAX algorithm uses femoral neck BMD <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> for calculation of fracture probability. BMD from non-hip sites has not been validated and is, therefore, not recommended for use.</p><p>Intervention thresholds have been estimated for other countries based upon assessment of absolute fracture risk and country-specific analyses. The 2010 Osteoporosis Canada guidelines recommend pharmacologic therapy to patients at high absolute risk (&gt;20 percent probability for major osteoporotic fracture over 10 years) and to individuals over age 50 years who have a fragility fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For those at moderate risk (10 to 20 percent), the decision to treat should be based upon the presence of additional risk factors not considered in the risk assessment system and upon individual preference.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, pharmacologic treatment was cost effective at all ages when the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture exceeded 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The United Kingdom National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) recommends an age-dependent intervention threshold that ranges from 7.5 to 30 percent for ages 50 to 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For clinicians in the United Kingdom, intervention thresholds may be accessed directly from the <a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2064\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX website</a> (click on &quot;Calculation Tool,&quot; select &quot;UK,&quot; and then click on &quot;View NOGG Guidance&quot; after entering patient-specific information).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11555765\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We largely agree with the NOF recommendations (initiate therapy in postmenopausal women with a history of hip or vertebral fracture, osteoporosis based upon BMD measurement [T-score &le;-2.5], or osteopenia and high risk of fracture). However, the benefit of treatment based upon absolute fracture risk, rather than BMD criteria alone, has not been assessed in clinical trials.</p><p>The emphasis on absolute fracture risk will increase the proportion of older women who are candidates for therapy. As an example, in a study using data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF), with a prospective cohort of community-dwelling Caucasian women &ge;65 years of age, application of the revised NOF treatment guidelines resulted in recommendations for pharmacologic therapy for 72 percent of women over 65 years of age and 93 percent of women over 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Applying bone density criteria alone (BMD lower than -2.5 at lumbar spine [LS] or femoral neck) resulted in a treatment recommendation for 50 percent of women in both age groups.</p><p>Thus, many more older women will be candidates for pharmacologic therapy using the new guidelines. Whether the selection of patients based upon clinical risk factors and BMD, rather than on BMD alone, improves benefit in older patients has not yet been established.</p><p>In addition, the NOF economic analysis estimated drug costs based upon use of generic bisphosphonates. The use of more expensive drugs increases the 10-year fracture probability at which intervention is cost effective. Thus, the decision to treat with more expensive drugs that may be indicated in selected patients should be individualized. NOF guidelines should not be applied to individuals living in different countries, as the NOF guidelines are based upon a United States-specific economic analysis. Intervention thresholds have been estimated for other countries, and country-specific guidelines are available or are in development.

However, monitoring with markers of bone turnover is an additional option for patients who have conditions that might interfere with drug absorption or efficacy, such as small bowel resections or other types of malabsorption, or for patients who are reluctant to take anti-osteoporosis medications regularly. In such patients, we typically measure fasting urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) or serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) before and three to six months after starting bisphosphonate or other antiresorptive therapy. A decrease of greater than 50 or 30 percent in urinary NTX excretion or serum CTX, respectively, provides evidence of compliance and drug efficacy. The patient can be reassured that the next BMD measurement will likely be stable or improved. In contrast, a decrease in markers of less than 30 percent may not necessarily indicate treatment failure. However, when this occurs, we question the patient about possible noncompliance or poor absorption (often related to an insufficient time interval between drug intake and food ingestion).

They are in various stages of development. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sclerostin inhibitors</strong> &ndash; Sclerostin is produced by osteocytes and inhibits bone formation. Sclerostin knockout mice have increased bone formation and high bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. It follows that inhibition of sclerostin should enhance osteoblast function and improve bone mass. In animal models and in a phase I trial in healthy adults, administration of a sclerostin monoclonal antibody increased bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-107</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, in a phase II trial in postmenopausal women, all doses of a monoclonal anti-sclerostin antibody (romosozumab) increased bone density at the LS, total hip, and femoral neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. In this one-year trial, 419 postmenopausal women with low bone mass (T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the LS, total hip, or femoral neck) were randomly assigned to subcutaneous romosozumab (variable dosing once monthly or once every three months), an active comparator (oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>, 70 mg weekly, or subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a>, 20 mcg daily), or placebo injections (monthly or every three months). The greatest increase in LS bone density was seen in the group receiving romosozumab 210 mg monthly (11.3 percent compared with 4.1 and 7.1 percent in the alendronate and teriparatide groups, respectively). There was a transient increase in bone formation markers and a more sustained decrease in bone resorption markers, a pattern that has not been seen among available osteoporosis therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In two subsequent trials specifically designed to assess fracture outcomes, treatment with romosozumab reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>] and nonvertebral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>] fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one trial, 7180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (mean T scores at the LS, total hip, and femoral neck of -2.72, -2.47, and -2.75, respectively) were randomly assigned to romosozumab (210 mg subcutaneously once monthly) or placebo for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Thereafter, all women received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> (60 mg subcutaneously every six months) for an additional 12 months. After 12 (0.5 versus 1.8 percent) and 24 months (0.6 versus 2.5 percent), the incidence of radiographic vertebral fracture was lower in the romosozumab group than in the placebo group (risk ratio at 12 months 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.47). The reduction in the incidence of nonvertebral fracture, a secondary endpoint, was not significant (1.6 versus 2.1 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.05).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another trial, 4093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prior fragility fracture (mean T-scores at the LS, total hip, and femoral neck of -2.96, -2.80, and 2.90, respectively) were randomly assigned to monthly subcutaneous romosozumab (210 mg) or weekly oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> (70 mg) for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. All patients subsequently received weekly oral alendronate. After 24 months, there were fewer radiographic vertebral fractures in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group than the alendronate-to-alendronate group (6.2 versus 11.9 percent, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.66). At the time of the primary analysis, the risk of clinical fractures (9.7 versus 13 percent), nonvertebral fractures (8.7 versus 10.6 percent), and hip fractures (2.0 versus 3.2 percent) was also lower in the romosozumab group. Romosozumab followed by alendronate appears to be more effective than alendronate alone in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Romosozumab has also been evaluated in patients previously treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>. In a phase III, open-label trial, 436 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who had taken an oral bisphosphonate for at least three years (mean 6.2 years), had low BMD (&le;-2.5 at the hip or spine), and had a history of fracture were randomly assigned to romosozumab (210 mg subcutaneously once monthly) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> (20 mcg subcutaneously once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. After 12 months, the mean change from baseline in total hip (+2.6 versus -0.6 percent) and LS (+9.8 versus +5.4 percent) BMD was better with romosozumab. Fracture data were collected as adverse events and occurred in a similar proportion of patients (3 to 4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In all three trials, there was an increased frequency of injection site reactions in the romosozumab group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women/abstract/110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-112</a>].

Lifestyle measures include adequate calcium and vitamin D, exercise, smoking cessation, counseling on fall prevention, and avoidance of heavy alcohol use. In general, 1200 mg of elemental calcium daily, total diet plus supplement, and 800 international units of vitamin D daily are advised. Postmenopausal women who are getting adequate calcium from dietary intake alone do not need to take calcium supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a>). If dietary intake is inadequate, we suggest calcium supplementation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients require vitamin D supplementation as it is difficult to achieve goals with diet alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77982 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to nonpharmacologic therapy, we recommend that postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (T-score &le;-2.5) or fragility fracture be treated with a pharmacologic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11555730\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of high-risk postmenopausal women with T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5, we also suggest pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A reasonable cutpoint that may be cost effective in some settings is a 10-year probability of hip fracture or combined major osteoporotic fracture of &ge;3.0 or &ge;20 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H11555730\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, we suggest oral bisphosphonates as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We prefer oral bisphosphonates as initial therapy because of their efficacy, favorable cost, and the availability of long-term safety data. (See <a href=\"#H16851025\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> as the initial choice of bisphosphonate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a> may be more convenient for patients, but a reduction in hip fracture risk has not been established in randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H1289346\" class=\"local\">'Choice of drug'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have esophageal disorders (achalasia, scleroderma involving the esophagus, esophageal strictures, varices), gastrointestinal intolerance to oral bisphosphonates, history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or an inability to follow the dosing requirements of oral bisphosphonates, including an inability to sit upright for 30 to 60 minutes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to swallow a pill, should not be treated with oral bisphosphonates and can be treated instead with intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Zoledronic acid</a> is the only IV bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy for fracture prevention and is, therefore, our agent of choice.

In such patients who have severe osteoporosis (T-score of -3.5 or below even in the absence of fractures, or T-score of -2.5 or below plus a fragility fracture), we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such patients who require therapy but who do not meet criteria for severe osteoporosis but have had fragility fractures, we suggest treatment with denosumab rather than teriparatide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with no history of fragility fractures, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> is a reasonable alternative, particularly in women at high risk for breast cancer.

Because of emerging concerns about an increased risk of vertebral fracture after discontinuation of denosumab, the need for indefinite administration of denosumab should be discussed with patients prior to its initiation.

If the lack of response is related to poor absorption, switching to an IV preparation should result in a more favorable response. Other alternatives include switching to a different oral bisphosphonate, recombinant human PTH (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a>), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>.
