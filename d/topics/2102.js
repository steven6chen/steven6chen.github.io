The tumor was initially described in 1995 as an acute agranular CD4-positive natural killer (NK) cell leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based on the blastic appearance and CD56 expression, the term &quot;blastic NK cell lymphoma&quot; was used. Subsequently, the term &quot;agranular CD4+CD56+ hematodermic <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasm/tumor&quot;</span> was coined based on the immunophenotype and a predilection for skin involvement. However, following the discovery and confirmation that BPDCN is derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (type 2 dendritic cells), the current nomenclature, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, was chosen to describe the entity in the 2008 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues and is expected to remain in the 2016 revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and management of BPDCN will be presented here. Chronic NK cell lymphocytosis and NK cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-killer-nk-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural killer (NK) cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685288\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematologic neoplasm and the exact incidence is unknown. The precise incidence of BPDCN is difficult to estimate due to constantly changing nomenclature and lack of precise defining criteria prior to the 2008 World Health Organization classification system. BPDCN represent 0.7 percent of primary cutaneous skin lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, cutaneous lymphoma registries likely underestimate the true incidence of BPDCN because a small but significant proportion of patients present without skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>BPDCN occurs in all races and all geographic locations; however, there are few data regarding whether the incidence varies by ethnicity or geography. BPDCN has been described in all age groups but is most common in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]; the majority of patients are older adults, and the median age at diagnosis is 65 to 67 years. There is a modest male predominance with a male to female ratio of approximately 2.5:1.</p><p>There are no known environmental or hereditary genetic factors predisposing to the development of BPDCN. BPDCN can occur as an isolated disease or in the context of other hematologic neoplasms. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients have antecedent history of hematologic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The relationship between BPDCN and other myeloid malignancies is not clearly elucidated. However, BPDCN should be distinguished from proliferations of mature CD56-negative plasmacytoid dendritic cells that can be seen in association with myeloid leukemias, most notably chronic myelomonocytic leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-myelomonocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685295\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) arises from the precursors of myeloid-derived resting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (type 2 dendritic cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Classical dendritic cells are the most potent antigen presenting cells. They play a critical role in the initiation of the immune response by capturing and processing antigens and presenting the processed antigens to other immune cells.</p><p>Unlike the classical dendritic cells, the plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing copious amounts of type I interferons <span class=\"nowrap\">(IFN-&alpha;/&beta;)</span> in response to viruses or virus-derived nucleic acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While it is biologically plausible that viral exposure may play a role in the pathogenesis, to date no association has been reported between BPDCN and a viral pathogen, including the Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p>Genetic studies have offered little insight into the pathogenesis of BPDCN (see <a href=\"#H7824460\" class=\"local\">'Genetic features'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While several recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported, none is unique to BPDCN. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies have reported loss of genomic DNA copy numbers for several genes that affect cell cycle progression, including <em>p18</em>, <em>p16</em>, <em>p27</em>, and <em>RB1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular studies have also reported mutations in <em>TET2</em> and <em>TP53</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <em>NPM1 </em>mutations have not been reported; in contrast, <em>FLT3-ITD</em> mutations can be present in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study using gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry identified aberrant NF-kB pathway activation in these tumors and explored the possibility of therapeutic targeting of the pathway to treat BPDCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Given the rarity of BPDCN, these observations come from relatively small numbers of patients. In addition, it is not clear whether these genetic alterations contribute to malignant transformation or if they merely represent a consequence of malignant transformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685302\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) present with cutaneous lesions with or without bone marrow involvement and leukemic dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A minority of cases present with leukemia without skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The skin lesions can be brown to violaceous bruise-like lesions, plaques, or tumors, and may be solitary or widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly are present in a significant majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Involvement of liver has been reported and appears to be more frequent in patients with extensive bone marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Involvement of the tonsils, paranasal cavities, lungs, eyes, central nervous system (CNS), and paravertebral involvement have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A retrospective series of 90 patients presenting with cutaneous involvement reported that the clinical presentation varied from one or two skin nodules or tumors to disseminated cutaneous spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most patients could be classified as having one of three cutaneous presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brown or purple nodular lesions (73 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Bruise-like&quot; brown to violaceous infiltrated patches (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated and mixed lesions (14 percent)</p><p/><p>Approximately half of patients initially presented with localized nodular disease consisting of one or two nodules, while 27 percent had multiple nodules affecting one or two areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common areas of localized involvement were the face or scalp (20 percent), lower limb (11 percent), trunk (9 percent), and upper limb (7 percent). Mucosal involvement was seen in five patients. Further evaluation revealed involvement of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, or blood in 61 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CNS involvement was demonstrated in 11 percent. Approximately one-third had no evidence of disease beyond the skin. </p><p>Case reports have also described patients presenting with a leukemic picture in the absence of cutaneous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Such patients present with abnormal circulating <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;lymphoid/monocytoid&quot;</span> cells with or without leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685323\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7824446\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3476801\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsies of involved areas demonstrate an infiltrate of medium-sized cells that spare the epidermis but can extend to the subcutaneous fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89886\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89886 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There is no coagulative necrosis, angioinvasion, or inflammatory cells within the infiltrate. When the subcutis is infiltrated, &quot;rimming&quot; of adipocytes can be seen.</p><p>The tumor cells are usually monomorphic, poorly differentiated, intermediate-sized blasts with fine chromatin and 2 to 3 nucleoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/4,6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,20,21</a>]. The nuclei are most commonly round or oval, but may be irregular (notched, folded, bilobed). The cells typically have scant blue-gray, agranular cytoplasm on Giemsa stained preparations. Mitotic activity is usually infrequent. On touch imprints, the tumor cells may show microvacuoles along the cell membrane (&quot;pearl necklace&quot; appearance) and pseudopod-like extensions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3476875\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymph node involvement usually displays a leukemic pattern with infiltration of monomorphic cells that resemble those seen in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While initial involvement may be confined to the interfollicular areas, eventually, involvement becomes diffuse. Coagulative necrosis and angioinvasion are not present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3476820\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral blood and bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common findings in the peripheral blood are thrombocytopenia (78 percent), anemia (65 percent), and neutropenia (34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Circulating malignant cells can be detected by morphologic review or flow cytometry of the peripheral blood. Morphologically, they are monomorphic, poorly differentiated, intermediate-sized blasts, resembling those seen in the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89887 \">picture 2</a>). While malignant cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of approximately 60 percent of cases, the number of circulating malignant cells is extremely variable. </p><p>Bone marrow involvement is present in over 80 percent of the patients and diffuse involvement is common. However, just as in the peripheral blood, the number of malignant cells in the bone marrow varies and special studies may be required to identify these cells. The tumor cells may show microvacuoles along the cell membrane (&quot;pearl necklace&quot; appearance) and pseudopod-like extensions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7824453\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunophenotype of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) can be confirmed by either immunohistochemistry or using flow cytometry, depending on the material available. The tumor cells express CD4 and CD56 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, several plasmacytoid dendritic cell associated markers have been evaluated for expression in normal and malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The expression of one or more of these antigens needs to be demonstrated to establish a definitive diagnosis of BPDCN. These markers include CD123 (interleukin-3 alpha-chain), <span class=\"nowrap\">BDCA-2/CD303</span> (blood dendritic cell antigen-2), TCL1, and SPIB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/12,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22-25</a>]. At our institution, we rely on CD123 and TCL1 in addition to CD4 and CD56 for making this diagnosis.</p><p>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression is observed in up to 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When present, TdT expression is variable and can be seen in 10 to 80 percent of cells in the tumor. CD68 expression can be seen in up to 50 percent of cases. However, CD68 expression may be weak and represented by a dot-like positivity in the Golgi zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>CD7 (a T cell antigen) and CD33 (a myeloid antigen) are also expressed relatively frequently. However, expression of CD19, CD20, CD79a (all B cell antigens), and CD3 or CD5 (T cell antigens) is usually not observed. Similarly, myeloperoxidase, CD117, lysozyme, CD13, and CD16 are not expressed. CD34 expression is also not present, and no Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) is detected in BPDCN.</p><p>Of note, rare cases that do not express CD56 have been reported, and the diagnosis of BPDCN can be made if the tumor cells express CD4, CD123, and TCL1. In addition, atypical cases with aberrant expression of B, T, or myeloid antigens have also been described. In order to retain specificity without being too restrictive, a scoring system has been proposed and is likely to be of great utility in establishing immunophenotypic diagnosis of BPDCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7824460\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of BPDCN cases have genetic abnormalities, but there is no single cytogenetic change that is typical or diagnostic. The T cell receptor (TCR) genes are usually germline. &#160;</p><p>Abnormal karyotype has been reported in 50 to 66 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>]. While not specific, the karyotype is significant for presence of gross genomic imbalances represented mostly by loss of genetic material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Certain chromosomes are preferentially targeted. These are 5q, 12p, 13q, 6q, 15q, and 9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These represent abnormalities seen in both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Molecular cytogenetic studies have identified monoallelic deletion of the NR3C1 locus at 5q31 as a recurrent abnormality in 28 percent of patients and this finding is associated with a poor clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In addition to classical cytogenetic analysis, BPDCN has also been assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The array-CGH studies also confirm that loss of genetic material is much more frequent than presence of additional genetic material. Furthermore, proteins that regulate cell cycle are preferentially targeted. <em><span class=\"nowrap\">CDKN2A/CDKN2B</em></span> on 9p21.3 is frequently lost; when biallelic, this deletion is associated with a poor outcome. Other frequently deleted regions include 13q13.1-q14.3 (<em>RB1</em>), 12p13.2-p13.1 (<em>CDKN1B</em>), 13q11-q12 (<em>LATS2</em>), and 7p12.2 (<em>IKZF1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In addition, gene expression studies have identified overexpression of <em>FLT3</em>, <em>HES6</em>, and<em> RUNX2</em> independently of genomic amplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. More recently, mutations in <em>TET2</em> and <em>TP53</em> were seen in 53 and 38 percent of cases analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685330\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is usually suspected in patients who present with brown to violaceous bruise-like lesions, plaques, or tumors. Skin biopsy with routine histology and immunophenotype is the single most important laboratory tool that will assist the clinician in establishing the diagnosis. However, an absence of skin lesions does not rule out the diagnosis since a minority of cases present with leukemia without skin involvement. As such, a diagnosis of BPDCN should also be suspected in a patient presenting with a poorly differentiated leukemia with an ambiguous immunophenotype. In either case, the diagnosis of BPDCN requires biopsy and morphologic assessment of the involved tissue, along with appropriate immunophenotypic studies by either multicolor flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. </p><p>Importantly, accumulations of mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells seen in association with some reactive conditions, such as Kikuchi's disease, and myeloid malignancies, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, are CD56 negative and should not be diagnosed as BPDCN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685339\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost 80 percent of patients with BPDCN present with skin lesions. A biopsy of the involved area is required for diagnosis. In addition to morphologic review, the evaluation should include an assessment of the expression of BPDCN-associated antigens by a panel of antibodies. To avoid misclassifying BPDCN, tumors that express CD4 and do not express CD11c, MPO, cytoplasmic CD3, and cytoplasmic CD79a should be evaluated for CD123 expression, regardless of CD56 expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In such tumors, expression of CD123 plus either BDCA2 or TCL1 suggests the diagnosis of BPDCN. BDCA4 expression, while not entirely specific, is helpful in making the diagnosis of BPDCN in conjunction with the other markers.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes other malignancies with cutaneous manifestations, such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CD56+ acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs)</strong> &ndash; Both CD56+ AML and BPDCN can present with skin lesions and circulating blasts and some cases of BPDCN express the myeloid antigen CD33, which is common to AML. However, unlike BPDCN, most cases of AML demonstrate positivity for myeloperoxidase and express other myeloid antigens such as CD13, CD15, and CD117.

Unlike BPDCN, the histology of nasal-type extranodal <span class=\"nowrap\">NK/T</span> cell lymphoma is characterized by a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate that invades the vascular walls, producing fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls and coagulative necrosis of surrounding tissues. Unlike in BPDCN, <span class=\"nowrap\">NK/T</span> cell lymphomas are associated with Epstein-Barr virus that can be demonstrated by in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER).

BPDCN can be differentiated from SPTCL based upon the immunophenotype and molecular studies. Unlike SPTCL, T cell receptor genes are usually germline and the tumor cells express CD56 but not cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1, granzyme B, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perforin).

Leukemic manifestation without skin involvement should be distinguished from other myeloid and lymphoid leukemia, and the distinction relies heavily on demonstration of the appropriate immunophenotype. Presence of leukemic blasts with an undifferentiated or ambiguous immunophenotype should raise the possibility of leukemic presentation of BPDCN. Of note, all of the antigens expressed on BPDCN malignant cells, including CD4, CD56, and even CD123, can be expressed individually on myeloid or lymphoid leukemia.

The OS was 41 percent at three years, and no relapses were observed after 27 months past HCT. A majority of patients received myeloablative conditioning and stem cells from either siblings or matched unrelated donors. In a univariate analysis, receiving transplant in first CR was associated with a significantly favorable outcome, whereas age, donor, source, and presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease had no impact on survival.

While the rarity of the disease and limited understanding of the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of BPDCN have been a significant impediment to conducting clinical trials specifically designed for BPDCN, one trial exploited the invariable expression of IL3 receptor (CD123), to develop targeted therapy for the neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastic-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-neoplasm/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
