The estimated prevalence is between 1 in 57,000 and 1 in 164,000 persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>First reported in 1894, the clinical manifestations of NBCCS were more clearly defined in 1960 by Gorlin and Goltz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Affected patients have multiple developmental anomalies and the early onset of multiple nevoid basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and medulloblastomas, usually by age 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other synonyms for NBCCS include the Gorlin or Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, basal cell nevus syndrome, bifid-rib basal-cell nevus syndrome, basal cell cancer syndrome, and multiple basal cell nevi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74644248\"><span class=\"h2\">PTCH1 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with a high degree of penetrance (approximately 97 percent), but variably expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The cause is a germline inactivating mutation involving the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene (<em>PTCH1</em>), which is located on chromosome 9q22.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/2,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-10</a>]. In most cases, loss of function mutations in <em>PTCH1</em> result in premature termination of the PTCH protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Loss of heterozygosity at this site in both hereditary and sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'PTCH1 in sporadic basal cell carcinomas'</a> below). In a manner similar to the retinoblastoma gene, two somatic &quot;hits&quot; in the same cell appear to be required for sporadic cases, while one somatic &quot;hit&quot; plus the inheritance of one defective allele underlies familial cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

SHH signaling is activated when HH binds to its receptor, a complex that is formed by PTCH and a second protein, Smoothened (SMO), a transmembrane protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69105 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. PTCH functions as a regulatory molecule for SMO, with PTCH-induced repression of SMO limiting the effect of the SHH signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].</p><p>According to this model, SMO repression is relieved following mutational inactivation of <em>PTCH1</em> in patients with NBCCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This results in constitutive overexpression of the SHH signal, which has been implicated in the development of BCC and other tumors, possibly via activation of the transcription factors Gli1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Gli2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76029 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/19,21,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,26-29</a>].

Only about 5 percent of all NBCCS case reports involve blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and a similar low frequency is reported in Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The expression of cutaneous BCCs as a component of the NBCCS appears to be blunted in individuals with dark skin as well as Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Only about 30 to 38 percent of black persons with NBCCS have BCCs (compared with 75 to 80 percent in Caucasians, (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> below)), and fewer than 15 percent have more than two BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Because of this, most black patients with NBCCS are diagnosed by asymptomatic odontogenic cysts discovered during routine dental or facial radiography rather than by the appearance of BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">PTCH1 in sporadic basal cell carcinomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support for the involvement of <em>PTCH1</em> in tumorigenesis is supported by the finding of acquired <em>PTCH1</em> mutations in approximately one-third of sporadic BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], in xeroderma pigmentosum-associated BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], as well as some sporadic meningiomas and medulloblastomas. In sporadic BCCs, inactivation of the <em>PTCH1</em> gene appears to be a necessary but insufficient step for tumor formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-genodermatoses#H523750964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The genodermatoses&quot;, section on 'Xeroderma pigmentosum'</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism responsible for <em>PTCH</em> mutations in sporadic BCCs is probably multifactorial. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is an important risk factor for early onset BCCs, and the <em>PTCH</em> gene appears to be a target for UV-induced mutations. However, typical UV signature mutations are found in only 30 to 40 percent of <em>PTCH1</em>-mutated sporadic BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], while they are more prominent in the BCCs of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, mutational events other than UV irradiation may also cause <em>PTCH</em> inactivation and trigger tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Other mutational events affecting the SHH pathway have also been implicated in the development of sporadic BCCs. These include activating mutations in the <em>SMO</em> gene, a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9q22.3 (the site of the <em>PTCH1</em> gene) and 16p, and mutations in a second <em>PTCH</em> gene, <em>PTCH2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/25,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,42-44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 100 clinical abnormalities have been reported in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS).

Although medulloblastomas (which are characteristically of the desmoplastic subtype) tend to develop at a young age, many of the classic features of NBCCS (ie, BCCs, palmar pits, calcified falx cerebri) may not be detected until the late teens or young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

BCCs arising in NBCCS are histologically indistinguishable from sporadic BCCs. The term &quot;nevoid&quot; does not refer to an association of the BCC with nevi, but instead was coined because early lesions may have the appearance of nevi with a prominent vascular component.</p><p>BCCs tend to be more aggressive in patients with NBCCS.

However, the relationship between sun exposure and the development of BCCs in patients with NBCCS is unclear. The anatomic site distribution of BCCs suggests that frequent sun exposure may not be essential for the development of BCCs in affected patients. However, the observation that there are more tumors on sun-exposed areas suggests that exposure promotes the development of BCCs in patients with NBCCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Thus, clinicians should be aware of the potential for vitamin D deficiency in patients with NBCCS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional studies are necessary to evaluate whether disease-specific factors other than photoprotection contribute to vitamin D deficiency in NBCCS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Future directions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2797783915\"><span class=\"h3\">Vismodegib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A placebo-controlled randomized trial found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vismodegib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vismodegib</a>, an oral hedgehog antagonist approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BCC, was beneficial for slowing the rate of BCC development and reducing tumor burden in NBCCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. In the trial, patients with NBCCS were treated with either 150 mg per day of vismodegib (n = 26) or placebo (n = 15) for 1 to 15 months (mean, 8 months). At three months, a significantly lower mean per-patient incidence of new, surgically eligible BCCs (diameter &gt;3 mm on nose or periorbital skin, &gt;5 mm on other facial sites, or &gt;9 mm on the trunk or limbs) was detected in the active treatment group than in the placebo group (2 versus 29 BCCs per year). In addition, tumor size decreased to a greater extent in patients who received vismodegib than in those who received placebo, with a few patients achieving complete remission. </p><p>Although these findings are promising, adverse effects, such as loss of taste, muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss limited the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vismodegib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vismodegib</a>; 14 of 26 patients (54 percent) discontinued treatment for this reason. In addition, tumors regrew following drug discontinuation. More studies are required to determine whether vismodegib has the potential to truly cure individual BCCs in NBCCS, as well as to clarify the optimal treatment regimen for vismodegib in this setting.

In a series of 28 patients with a total of 230 advanced and nonadvanced BCCs (including five patients with NBCCS), tumor regrowth during treatment was detected in six patients (21 percent) and affected 5 percent of all tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Molecular genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary manifestation of NBCCS is the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), which are histologically identical to sporadic BCCs. While BCCs frequently occur on sun-exposed areas, they can occur in any location and tend to be more aggressive in patients with NBCCS. Important risk factors for the development of BCCs include sun exposure and radiation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Basal cell carcinomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals diagnosed with NBCCS should undergo frequent surveillance by a dermatologist to facilitate early diagnosis of new nevi. The management of BCCs that are diagnosed can be difficult because of the multiplicity of lesions and the need for multiple procedures. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of basal cell carcinomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to BCCs, NBCCS is associated with a variety of other cysts and tumors, including odontogenic keratocysts and medulloblastomas. Therapeutic radiation therapy needs to be avoided in such patients, since this can precipitate the development of numerous, aggressive BCCs.
