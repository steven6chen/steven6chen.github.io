When <em>E. coli</em> strains acquire certain genetic material, they can become pathogenic. <em>E. coli</em> are among the most frequent bacterial causes of diarrhea and are classified by clinical syndrome they produce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67152 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The characteristics of diarrheal illness caused by enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC), enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC, also called Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> or STEC), enteroinvasive <em>E. coli</em> (EIEC), and enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> (EAEC or EAggEc) will be reviewed here. EHEC is also discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and prevention of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>E. coli</em> can be cultured readily from the stool under aerobic conditions. On selective media, such as MacConkey agar, <em>E. coli</em> usually appear as pink colonies, indicating that the organism ferments lactose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63042 \">picture 1</a>). Additional biochemical identification should also be performed, since up to 10 percent of <em>E. coli</em> do not ferment lactose or ferment lactose relatively slowly. The most useful biochemical identification test for <em>E. coli</em> is the indole test, which is positive in up to 99 percent of <em>E. coli</em> strains.</p><p>Pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> are not distinguishable from other strains or from each other by the appearance on culture plates or by the results of the usual biochemical tests. To determine whether the isolated strain is one of the pathogenic strains or merely a constituent of the normal flora, additional identification techniques must be employed, which are generally limited to research laboratory settings. </p><p>EHEC O157 is the only pathogenic strain that can be identified readily in the clinical laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Further testing on pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> isolates must be performed in a research or reference laboratory. This testing can include determining the serotype of the strain, performing biological assays (bioassays) that demonstrate strain virulence, and using genetic tools, such as DNA probing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, to identify genetic material that encodes for specific virulence factors.</p><p>The virulence traits are distinct for each category of pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These virulence traits include adherence factors that allow <em>E. coli</em> to attach to the intestinal mucosa, and toxins that interrupt normal intestinal cell secretion and absorption (secretory toxins) or that damage the intestinal cell (cytotoxins). These adherence factors and toxins are encoded on accessory genetic elements in <em>E. coli</em>, such as plasmids, transposons, and bacteriophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTEROTOXIGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI (ETEC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC) causes watery diarrhea in young humans and other mammals, as well as in older individuals who have not been exposed to the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. ETEC survive readily in water and food supplies in the developing world and is one of the most common bacterial causes of dehydrating diarrheal illness in children under two years of age in these regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These strains can also cause diarrhea in travelers to tropical regions who are exposed to contaminated food and water. In addition, ETEC is emerging as a significant diarrheal pathogen in developed regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Microbiology, epidemiology, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of disease due to ETEC consists of transmission of bacteria, intestinal colonization, and elaboration of virulence factor(s). ETEC must contain colonizing fimbriae to permit the attachment of the bacteria to the intestine. Antibodies to fimbrial adhesins, specifically colonization factor antigen I, have been shown to be protective in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><em>E. coli</em> capable of attaching to the intestine must also be capable of elaborating virulence factors in order to cause disease. There are two major classes of secretory toxins encoded on plasmids in ETEC strains: heat-labile toxins (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>E. coli</em> that contain one or both of these toxin classes are classified as ETEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>LT is a complex family of toxins related to cholera toxin produced by <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> with respect to structure, function and mechanism. LT acts by stimulating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP, which results in secretion of chloride from intestinal crypt cells and inhibition of absorption of sodium chloride at the villus tips. Secretion of free water into the intestinal lumen follows, manifesting clinically as watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Studies suggest that LT and its secretion apparatus can cluster at one end of the bacterial organism, which may permit ETEC to focus toxin delivery to the host intestinal cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Microbiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two major STs that may be present in ETEC; only one of these, STa, is associated with human disease. ST activates enterocyte cyclic GMP and also leads to the stimulation of chloride secretion and inhibition of sodium chloride absorption. The end result is secretion of free water into the intestinal lumen, which manifests clinically as watery diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Approximately 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> ETEC must be ingested to induce diarrhea in an otherwise healthy individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Exposure to this large inoculum occurs readily since the pathogen thrives in the environment. The illness has a short incubation period, and the onset of symptoms and signs is rapid. Patients may report nausea, but vomiting is uncommon. Diarrhea is watery and may be mild or severe. The illness may last for one to five days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ETEC is currently performed in the research or reference laboratory using DNA probes that identify the genes for LT or ST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Classically these organisms were identified by bioassays for the secretory toxins: the rabbit ileal loop for LT and the suckling mouse assay for ST.</p><p>Treatment of diarrheal illness due to ETEC is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTEROPATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI (EPEC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (EPEC) strains are defined by the characteristic &quot;attaching and effacing&quot; effect they elicit upon interaction with epithelial cells and by the fact that they do not produce Shiga toxin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56217 \">figure 1</a>). EPEC have been associated with sporadic diarrheal illness and diarrhea outbreaks, most commonly among children less than six months of age in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Disease due to EPEC strains has been described among adults, although overt illness is much less common. This is true even among adults in the developing world who frequently develop diarrhea due to ETEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPEC proteins do not behave like classic toxins; the following observations have furthered our understanding of how bacterial organisms can affect cell physiology through adherence, even in the absence of toxin production. The steps in pathogenesis of EPEC for initiation of diarrheal illness include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial localized adherence of the organisms to the enterocyte</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of signal transduction in the enterocyte by EPEC protein secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of intimate adherence with the enterocyte </p><p/><p>Signal transduction is initiated by bacterial secretion of proteins directly into the enterocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This causes mobilization of intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C and the myosin-light-chain kinase, and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Activation of these signal transduction pathways produces changes in the enterocyte (resulting in the classic &quot;attaching and effacing&quot; lesion), alterations in water and electrolyte secretion, and increased permeability of intestinal tight junctions. The genes that encode these virulence traits are located on a plasmid (bundle forming pili) or within a chromosomal pathogenicity island of the organism. Atypical EPEC do not produce bundle forming pili. </p><p>EspF is a secreted protein that is not involved with attaching and effacing; it appears to disrupt intestinal barrier function by increasing monolayer permeability via alteration of electrical resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. EspF has several protein-protein interaction domains that may function by interacting with endocytic regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Two other secreted proteins, EspG and EspG2, inhibit luminal membrane chloride absorption by decreasing surface expression of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Cl-/OH-</span> exchanger via disruption of microtubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The diarrhea associated with EPEC in children can be severe, with concomitant vomiting and dehydration. If diarrhea persists, malnutrition can be a devastating complication, particularly in the developing world where resources for supportive therapy may be limited. Cell culture data suggest that EPEC infection inhibits absorption of thiamine; this may be one mechanism by which EPEC infection contributes to malnutrition of some micronutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for identification of EPEC is the detection by DNA probe or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the EPEC adherence factor (EAF). These diagnostic assays are available only in research or reference laboratories.</p><p>EPEC was originally categorized and recognized by serotype and later, by its ability to adhere in a localized fashion to epithelial cells in a tissue culture adherence assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Subsequently, it was identified by its ability to mobilize cellular actin in a fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Using these older techniques, the absence of EHEC toxins also had to be demonstrated in a putative EPEC organism because some strains of EHEC also develop attaching and effacing lesions.</p><p>Treatment of diarrheal illness due to EPEC is discussed in detail separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries#H1159942460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTEROHEMORRHAGIC ESCHERICHIA COLI (EHEC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC) strains are capable of producing Shiga toxin and like EPEC strains, demonstrate an &quot;attaching and effacing&quot; lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56217\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56217 \">figure 1</a>). A subset of EHEC organisms are serotype O157:H7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]; non-O157 serotypes also account for a large proportion of EHEC infections.</p><p>EHEC strains, especially those belonging to serotype O157:H7, have been responsible for large outbreaks of bloody diarrhea, some associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a triad of microangiopathic anemia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p>EHEC infection is discussed further separately.

There has been a consistent association between persistent diarrhea among children and the presence of EAEC in the stool in studies from Chile, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Bangladesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenic-escherichia-coli/abstract/37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-43</a>].</p><p>EAEC appears to be a cause of acute diarrheal illness among many different subpopulations in both resource-limited and resource-rich regions.

When <em>E. coli</em> strains acquire certain genetic material, they can become pathogenic. <em>E. coli</em> are among the most frequent bacterial causes of diarrhea and are classified by clinical syndrome they produce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67152 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> can be cultured readily from the stool under aerobic conditions. Pathogenic <em>E. coli</em> are not distinguishable from other strains or from each other by their appearance on culture plates or by the results of the usual biochemical tests. To distinguish pathogenic strains from normal flora, additional identification techniques must be employed in a research or reference laboratory. EHEC O157 is the only pathogenic strain that can be identified readily in the clinical laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterotoxigenic <em>E. coli</em> (ETEC) causes watery diarrhea. ETEC survives readily in water and food and is one of the most common bacterial causes of dehydrating diarrheal illness in children under two years of age in developing regions. ETEC can also cause diarrhea among travelers to tropical regions who are exposed to contaminated food and water and, in addition, is emerging as a pathogen in developed regions. There are two major classes of secretory toxins encoded on plasmids in ETEC strains: heat-labile toxins (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST). These toxins activate cyclic AMP or GMP respectively, leading to stimulation of chloride secretion, inhibition of sodium chloride absorption, and secretion of free water into the intestinal lumen, manifesting as watery diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (EPEC) strains are defined by the characteristic &quot;attaching and effacing&quot; effect they elicit upon interaction with epithelial cells and by the fact that they do not produce Shiga toxin. EPEC have been associated with sporadic diarrheal illness and diarrhea outbreaks, most commonly among children less than six months of age in developing countries. EPEC proteins do not behave like classic toxins; rather, they affect cell physiology through adherence and induction of signal transduction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC) strains are capable of producing Shiga toxin and like EPEC strains, demonstrate an &quot;attaching and effacing&quot; lesion. A subset of EHEC organisms are serotype O157:H7. EHEC strains, especially those belonging to serotypes O157:H7 (and subsequently, O104:H4) have been responsible for large outbreaks of bloody diarrhea, some associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroinvasive <em>E. coli</em> (EIEC) is closely related to <em>Shigella</em> and causes disease that is similar to shigellosis. EIEC invades the intestinal cell, multiplies intracellularly, and extends into the adjacent intestinal cells. The same genes facilitate pathogenesis of both EIEC and <em>Shigella</em>. Clinical disease with EIEC begins as watery diarrhea and may or may not progress to bloody diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroaggregative <em>E. coli</em> (EAEC) was first described in the 1980s, when collections of <em>E. coli</em> from studies of diarrhea in developing world settings were examined in tissue culture adherence assays. <em>E. coli</em> that had a distinctive cascading adherence on Hep-2 cells were observed more frequently in the stools of children with diarrhea than children without diarrhea. EAEC appears to be a cause of persistent and acute diarrheal illness among many demographic groups in both developing and developed regions.
