However, these risks must be interpreted in the context of the potential benefits of these medications, as well as in the context of the adverse effects that may be associated with conventional treatments and other targeted biologic agents for immune-mediated diseases and the effects of the disease itself. The adverse effects of conventional treatments and other agents, including the risk of malignancy induction, are also significant in many cases. Thus, the decision to use a TNF-alpha inhibitor must be an individual one, based upon the specific clinical features and the unique risk profile of a given patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibitors of TNF-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five inhibitors of TNF-alpha are widely available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn disease, and several other inflammatory disorders.

The biology of TNF-alpha is discussed in detail separately.

A significant body of literature also supports the concept that TNF-alpha is active against some forms of cancer. Experimental evidence of an anti-tumor effect for TNF-alpha led to the systemic administration of this cytokine for the treatment of some malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292145047\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures of risk</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Standardized incidence ratios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many formal analyses of the risk of malignancy posed by TNF-alpha inhibitor use, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) have been used to assess the degree of risk among patients receiving TNF inhibitors compared with the baseline risk of malignancy in the general population. While providing an indication of malignancy risk associated with treatments, they cannot differentiate between the risk associated with treatment and the risk associated with the diagnosis.</p><p>SIR is defined in the following manner:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>SIR = (Observed cases of malignancy &divide; Expected cases) x 100</p></div></div><p>To estimate the number of expected cases of malignancy within a population over a specific period of time, investigators often refer to one of several large registries. In the United States, data can be obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, a population-based registry that includes all invasive cancers plus cancer of the urinary bladder and breast carcinoma in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In many European countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, there are national cancer registries with mandatory reporting. These national registries have been used as a source of background population rates for comparison with patients treated with TNF inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292145060\"><span class=\"h3\">Relative risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative risk (RR) presents the risk in patients exposed to a treatment compared with the risk in patients not exposed to a treatment, or exposed to an alternative treatment. The advantage of calculating RR is that it is more specific for analysis of treatment-associated risks compared with SIRs.</p><p>There are many ways to calculate RR depending upon the nature of the data available (eg, a comparison of incident rates [incident rate ratio], a comparison on time to an event [hazard ratio]). For the purpose of this review, all RRs will be labelled &quot;relative risk,&quot; regardless of the statistics used to calculate risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING MALIGNANCY RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proof of a link between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor use and the development of cancer is difficult for several reasons. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk from underlying disease</strong> &ndash; Patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors may have an inherent predisposition to cancer based upon their underlying disease. As examples, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may have up to a 10 to 15 percent overall increase in the risk of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.10 to 1.15) compared with the general population, and patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The risk of malignancy is site-specific in RA, in which it appears to be increased for lymphoma and, perhaps, for lung cancer, but in which it appears to be potentially decreased for colorectal and breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It can be difficult to distinguish the additional risk conferred by TNF-alpha inhibitors from the baseline risk, although many of the later studies have included analytic approaches that can account for this baseline risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk from other medications</strong> &ndash; Patients with immune-mediated disorders often receive other medications concomitantly with TNF-alpha inhibitors that increase the risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), commonly used with TNF-alpha inhibitors in the treatment of RA, is associated with an elevated risk of lymphoma in some but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. Similar considerations apply for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and other conventional immunosuppressive medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate#H59543899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;, section on 'Common toxicities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exclusion of cancer patients from clinical trials</strong> &ndash; Patients with prior malignancy have been excluded from clinical trials with TNF inhibitors because of concern over a potentially increased risk of recurrent or new malignancy in such patients. Thus, data regarding cancer risk in this population of particular interest are limited. (See <a href=\"#H24092381\" class=\"local\">'Cancer risk in patients with prior malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rarity of cancer as an outcome</strong> &ndash; Relative rarity of the outcome means that many studies may be too small individually to rule in or rule out, with certainty, an increased risk of malignancy; combined analysis across many studies may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fewer studies on </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=certolizumab-pegol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">certolizumab pegol</a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a> &ndash; The majority of studies have focused on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, and studies of the newer TNF inhibitors, including certolizumab pegol and golimumab, are limited. It is not known whether the association between these newer TNF inhibitors and malignancy will be the same as that observed for the original three therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Study focus on patients with RA</strong> &ndash; A majority of studies have focused on TNF inhibitor use in RA. Whether these same risks would be observed with other classes of biologic therapies or in other autoimmune diseases is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">STUDIES OF OVERALL CANCER RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, there is a preponderance of evidence that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors do not increase the risk of most solid tumors, except for some skin cancers. However, uncertainty remains, and study design can influence the findings. (See <a href=\"#H1106849207\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of increased risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of no increased long-term risk'</a> below.)</p><p>Rigorous clinical trials have been performed for TNF-alpha inhibitors in contrast to most nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), facilitating detection of events that occur during the trial period. Long-term risks of cancer, however, cannot be determined from short-term randomized trials.</p><p>Although some meta-analyses of clinical trial data have found increased cancer risk with TNF inhibitor use, observational data, particularly from registries, have generally been unable to confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/3,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-18</a>]. This discrepancy may result, in part, from the more complete reporting of malignancies in clinical trials than in the context of routine practice, in which, in the absence of a cancer registry, reporting may depend upon voluntary postmarketing surveillance. Evaluation of risk using observational studies is also highly dependent upon how cancers are identified and upon what comparator is chosen.</p><p>Despite most evidence suggesting no increase in malignancy risk overall, these analyses have assumed that the effect of TNF inhibitor therapies would be the same across all anatomical sites and malignancy subtypes. Instead, risks may be different for certain individual malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Solid malignancy risk'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Skin cancer risk'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of no increased long-term risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, evidence indicates that overall cancer risk may not increase over time in patients who use TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rather than other therapies. Additional evidence suggests that these agents do not increase cancer risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other conditions. Several reports, including data for patients with RA, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and other conditions, have shown that risk may only be elevated for skin cancer but not for other cancers overall compared with patients receiving other DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Skin cancer risk'</a> below).

The study found no increase in the rate of malignancy in trials of at least 24 weeks' duration in patients receiving biologic agents overall or with any individual biologic agent, including TNF inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, or anakinra, except in one subset. There was a small increased risk at 52 weeks for patients receiving a TNF inhibitor plus MTX (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9; absolute risk of 1.1 versus 0.5 percent), but differences among groups were not statistically significant with other analyses, other time points, or TNF inhibitor monotherapy. Thus, the importance of this finding is uncertain. A total of only 211 malignancies were observed during the 63 trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> &ndash; Several studies using different approaches have found that TNF inhibitor therapy in patients with IBD is not associated with increased cancer risk.

The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was significantly increased in patients treated with TNF inhibitors among a cohort of 20,648 patients with RA followed in the national administrative databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, compared with patients who had received nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (18.9 versus 12.7 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.24-1.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of patient-level data from randomized trials of TNF inhibitor therapy, involving 15,418 patients, showed a significantly increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer among patients receiving TNF inhibitors (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.11-3.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>By contrast, evidence of no increased risk in nonmelanoma skin cancer due to TNF inhibitor use includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Danish Database for Biological Therapies in Rheumatology (DANBIO) registry found no increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer when comparing 3347 TNF inhibitor-treated patients with 3812 TNF inhibitor-untreated patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) also found no increased risk (eg, for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) among 11,881 TNF inhibitor-treated patients compared with 3629 TNF inhibitor-untreated patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The BSRBR-RA also studied the risk of recurrent skin cancer in 283 patients receiving either TNF inhibitors or conventional DMARDs with a past history of nonmelanoma skin cancer prior to starting therapy. The crude incidence rate of new skin cancer was almost 10-fold higher compared with those without a previous cancer; however, the risk was not increased in those receiving TNF inhibitor therapies compared with patients receiving nonbiologic therapies.</p><p/><p>Both the Danish and British studies did find an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with RA compared with the general population. This risk increase ranged from a 76 to 83 percent increase in patients with RA who were not treated with TNF inhibitors and a 72 to 92 percent increase among patients treated with TNF inhibitor therapies. This supports the view that all patients with RA should be screened for skin cancer, regardless of whether they are receiving TNF inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141609947\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are concerns about a possible association between TNF inhibitors and malignant melanoma, especially following reports of successful treatment of malignant melanoma with isolated limb perfusion with TNF-alpha itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-melanoma-in-transit-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous melanoma: In transit metastases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;</a>). However, because malignant melanoma is a rare outcome, large studies are required to explore this risk among patients receiving TNF inhibitors for rheumatic diseases and uncertainty regarding this risk remains.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two studies have suggested an increased risk:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a population-based cohort study in Sweden of patients with RA who were either treated with a TNF inhibitor (n = 10,878) or were not treated with a biologic agent (n = 42,198) and of matched controls from the general population (n = 162,743), the risk of a first invasive melanoma was increased in patients receiving TNF inhibitors compared with patients with RA who were not treated with biologic agents (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This difference resulted in an absolute increase in risk for this population of 20 per 100,000 person-years. There was no significant increase in such risk for RA patients who were not treated with a biologic compared with the general population controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A pooled analysis of two observational studies identified in a 2011 systematic review found a trend suggesting an increased risk of melanoma, but the data were imprecise and did not achieve statistical significance (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.92-2.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of melanoma was not proven among patients treated with TNF inhibitors in a 2016 meta-analysis involving patients from 11 European biologic registers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In total, 130,315 patients with RA contributing 579,983 person-years of exposure were studied, including 48,304 patients never treated with TNF inhibitors. Overall, 287 first melanomas were recorded. Compared with the general population, the observed RR among patients treated with TNF inhibitors was 1.2 (95% CI 0.99-1.6). Compared with patients with RA who had never been exposed to biologic therapies, the RR was 1.14 (95% CI 0.8-1.6).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A large variation in risk was observed across the different countries, although this was felt to be explained largely by the low rates of melanoma within each register. There were limitations to the study methods common to observational research, such as ascertainment bias, and individual variation of risk among populations with higher baseline risk, such as in Scandinavia; therefore, a small risk of melanoma cannot be excluded completely. However, the absolute risk is very low.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24092381\"><span class=\"h1\">CANCER RISK IN PATIENTS WITH PRIOR MALIGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited study has failed to provide evidence for increased risk of recurrent or new cancer in patients treated with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor who have a history of a prior malignancy. The paucity of data regarding this question has resulted from the exclusion of such patients from clinical trials with TNF inhibitors because of concern over such risk and from practice guidelines or drug labeling promoting caution in this population, given the lack of information to document safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1468934039\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior malignancy (all cancers combined)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analyses of data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) involving over 18,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have not shown increased risk associated with a history of prior malignancy (all cancers combined) in patients treated with TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. An earlier analysis was updated in 2016 and included 159 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-treated and 243 TNF inhibitor-treated patients, with a median follow-up period of seven years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5 to 8.8 years) following the start of TNF inhibitor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There was no increased risk seen in association with TNF inhibitor use (relative risk [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.88); notably, a higher proportion of patients experienced a recurrence of the same cancer in the nonbiologic DMARD-treated cohort compared with the TNF inhibitor-treated patients (17 versus 13 percent). The absolute risks were 54 and 33 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively.</p><p>The lack of evidence for an overall difference in risk of malignancy between the populations in the BSRBR-RA study should be interpreted with caution, as undefined criteria used in practice by British rheumatologists for selecting therapy in such patients may have influenced the study outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2322844680\"><span class=\"h2\">History of malignant melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2016 report from the BSRBR-RA, a registry in the United Kingdom of over 18,000 RA patients, and updating a previous analysis from this registry, 15 traditional (nonbiologic) DMARD-treated and 23 TNF inhibitor-treated patients were reported to have a history of melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Of these, two DMARD patients and three patients in the TNF inhibitor group have been reported to have had a recurrence.</p><p>Whether melanoma conveys greater risk than other malignancies for disease recurrence following TNF inhibitor treatment remains to be determined by further study, but as TNF itself has been used successfully to treat melanoma, alternative biologic therapies should be considered for individuals with a personal history of melanoma, with a full <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> analysis taken in conjunction with the patient and their melanoma clinician. Whether this theoretical risk also extends to patients with a family history of melanoma is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2879499367\"><span class=\"h2\">History of head and neck cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No increase in the risk of recurrent head and neck cancer was detected in a retrospective cohort study that analyzed data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs administrative databases from 1998 to 2008 and a review of electronic medical records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Among 180 patients with RA and a head and neck cancer, recurrence rates did not differ significantly between patients subsequently treated with TNF inhibitor therapy and those treated with nonbiologic DMARDs (5 of 31 [16 percent] versus 44 of 149 [30 percent], respectively). Although this is the largest study of head and neck cancer recurrence in patients with RA, it is limited by its observational nature, inevitable selection bias and unmeasured confounding variables, and the small number of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1998149412\"><span class=\"h2\">History of breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two reports have described no increase in recurrent breast cancer in association with the use of TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>An analysis of data from Sweden found no difference in the rate of recurrent breast cancer among a matched cohort of 120 women starting TNF inhibitor therapy and 120 biologic-na&iuml;ve patients with RA, both with a history of past breast cancer, with nine women developing breast cancer recurrence in each group after a median of 4.9 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The median time from the first breast cancer to the date of starting TNF inhibitor therapy or follow-up was 9.4 years. The generalizability of the results to women with more recent or poor-prognosis breast cancer is not known.</p><p>A second study set up with the United States Medicare database also did not confirm an increased risk of recurrent breast cancer among 291 women with either RA or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving TNF inhibitors over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, compared with 1164 matched nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

An analysis of data from the Swedish clinical registries of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, involving a total of 78,483 individuals, found that there were no differences between patients who had received TNF inhibitors and those who were na&iuml;ve to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the distributions of tumor stage or in the relative risk (RR) of death among patients diagnosed with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Similarly, there was no difference in the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates following solid cancer diagnosis between &quot;anti-TNF ever&quot; and &quot;anti-TNF never&quot; -treated patients in the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-risk-of-malignancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to use a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor must be based upon the specific clinical features and unique risk profile of a given patient. The risks associated with TNF inhibitor use must be interpreted in the context of the potential benefits associated with these medications, as well as the adverse effects associated with conventional treatments for immune-mediated diseases. The adverse effects of conventional treatments, including the risk of malignancy induction, are also significant in many cases.

A majority of observational studies have not confirmed an increased risk, although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several warnings regarding such risk. (See <a href=\"#H1106849207\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of increased risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Solid malignancy risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Challenges in establishing the true magnitude of risk (if any) between TNF inhibitor use and the development of malignancy include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased predisposition to cancer based upon the patient's underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Challenges in establishing malignancy risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Concomitant use of other medications that can heighten malignancy risk, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.
