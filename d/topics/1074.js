Intracoronary thrombosis may result during or soon after the procedure. In addition, metal (which is procoagulant) stents can trigger thrombus formation. Stent thrombosis can be a life-threatening event. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Clinical presentation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive antithrombotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blockers, glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors, and parenteral anticoagulants is used to decrease the risk of early intracoronary thrombosis.

In uncomplicated procedures, the heparin or bivalirudin is stopped at the end of the procedure. For femoral access, sheath removal should be accomplished when the ACT falls to less than 150 to 180 for heparin (or two hours after discontinuation for bivalirudin) or a vascular closure device can be used immediately when there is suitable vascular anatomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are at high risk for acute stent thrombosis based on angiographic criteria (visible thrombus, persistent dissection, postprocedure Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade &lt;3), we add a glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor.

Furthermore, if bleeding occurs, anticoagulant therapy may still need to be interrupted, increasing the risk for thromboembolism. We try to minimize any interruption of oral anticoagulation with use of radial access and other bleeding avoidance strategies. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-receiving-long-term-oral-anticoagulation-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275406809\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS UNDERGOING BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We estimate that a small number of patients (&lt;5 percent) who undergo PCI do not receive a stent and are treated with balloon angioplasty. For those patients in whom stenting is intended, preprocedural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a thienopyridine are appropriate.</p><p>No randomized trials have directly addressed the optimal long-term antiplatelet strategy in patients who undergo PCI but do not receive a stent. Some experts, including the authors of the Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease section of the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis guidelines, suggest one month of dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) due to concerns about an increase in thrombotic potential caused by iatrogenic plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-elective-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-general-use/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>While balloon angioplasty does disrupt the integrity of the vascular endothelium, acute intracoronary thrombosis rarely occurs after 48 hours. Thus, the theoretical benefit from one month of dual antiplatelet therapy must be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding during this time. Based on limited evidence, we suggest one month of dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) in patients not at high risk of bleeding or planned surgery within 30 days; for those with either of these, we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

However, even with proper timing and dosing, the risk of stent thrombosis and other ischemic complications, as well as major bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, persists.

For those patients not on chronic aspirin therapy, as well as for those on a maintenance dose of &lt;325 mg daily, we give 325 mg at least two hours before the procedure, if possible.
