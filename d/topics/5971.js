In 1909, Dr. Chevalier Jackson, a laryngologist at the Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia, described the surgical techniques and critical considerations related to performing cricothyrotomy, which he called &quot;high tracheostomy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Before the advent of antibiotics, cricothyrotomy was often performed because of severe infection or an inflammatory process (eg, diphtheria). Dr. Jackson became famous for popularizing the procedure. However, he then began to receive hundreds of referrals for patients who had developed tracheal stenosis following the procedure. After investigating nearly 200 of these cases, he condemned cricothyrotomy in a well-publicized paper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Following this report, cricothyrotomy fell out of favor until the 1970s when two physicians, Brantigan and Grow, reported a series of 655 patients who had undergone elective cricothyrotomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation. They reported a low rate of complications, 6.1 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Only eight patients (0.01 percent) developed subglottic stenosis, none of whom developed a chronic condition. Consequently, cricothyrotomy, which is generally considered easier to perform than emergency tracheostomy, was revisited and has now become the surgical rescue technique of choice for the failed airway in adults. </p><p>Because cricothyrotomy is a rarely performed but potentially life-saving procedure of last resort in the patient with a failed airway, clinicians responsible for airway management must retain familiarity with the necessary equipment and relevant anatomy. While debate continues regarding the merits and risks of various approaches or techniques for performing the procedure, it remains clear that skill acquisition and maintenance are vital. We suggest that emergency clinicians responsible for airway management review the anatomy and practice with the equipment needed for cricothyrotomy several times each year.</p><p>Performance of cricothyrotomy in adults is reviewed here. Other aspects of difficult airway management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cricothyrotomy is rarely performed, but rates vary among different providers and settings. A five year review at one institution found that cricothyrotomy comprised 1 percent of all intubations in the emergency department (ED) and 10.9 percent of intubations in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Earlier reports found a cricothyrotomy rate of 1.7 percent for all intubations and a rate of 14.8 percent for all prehospital intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>One study observed a decline in the rate of cricothyrotomies performed on trauma patients over 10 years following the establishment of an emergency medicine residency training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The cricothyrotomy rate before the residency was 1.8 percent and steadily dropped to 0.2 percent. The authors attributed the decline to several possible causes, including widespread use of rapid-sequence intubation, the presence of supervisory emergency medicine faculty 24 hours a day, and diminished concern about performing orotracheal intubation on trauma patients without first ruling out cervical spine injury by radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>With ongoing adoption of advanced video laryngoscopy and increasingly effective non-invasive airway rescue techniques, it is likely that the rate of cricothyrotomy will continue to decline. However, while infrequently performed, the procedure continues to be a life-saving intervention and will likely remain the cornerstone of failed airway management for the foreseeable future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cricothyrotomy is indicated when an emergency airway is required and orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation is either unsuccessful or contraindicated. When the clinician cannot intubate and cannot oxygenate (CICO) the patient, the swift establishment of an airway is crucial. Failure to provide oxygen to the brain may lead to anoxic encephalopathy and ultimately death. In a CICO scenario, placement of an extraglottic airway device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) may be attempted as a rescue maneuver or as a bridge to provide ventilation while preparations are made to perform a cricothyrotomy. However, if oxygenation cannot be maintained, cricothyrotomy is required. Management of the difficult and failed airway is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conditions associated with a difficult airway that may necessitate cricothyrotomy include massive hemorrhage, profound emesis, trismus, obstructing lesions (eg, tumor, polyp), and a broad array of traumatic and congenital deformities. One study found that of all clinical conditions requiring cricothyrotomy, 32 percent involved facial fractures, 32 percent blood or vomitus in the airway, 7 percent traumatic airway obstruction, and 11 percent failed intubation in the absence of other specified problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Absolute contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to emergency cricothyrotomy in adults. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible or known transection of the trachea, laryngotracheal disruption with retraction of the distal trachea into the mediastinum, and fractured larynx are relative contraindications to cricothyrotomy. In such cases, tracheostomy or stabilization of the distal tracheal segment followed by direct intubation is likely to be the best approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-neck-injuries-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a>.) </p><p>Surgical cricothyrotomy is relatively contraindicated in young children for several reasons. The airway of a child is funnel-shaped, with the narrowest part located at the cricoid ring rather than at the vocal cords. This narrowing increases the risk for developing subglottic stenosis following cricothyrotomy.</p><p>Some believe that surgical cricothyrotomy can damage the cricoid cartilage of young children. Since the tracheal cartilages are C-shaped, soft, and pliable in a child, the cricoid cartilage is the only circumferential support for the trachea and thus the principal structure maintaining airway patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A child's airway is smaller in diameter than an adult's and even a small amount of stenosis may cause significant impairment of air flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The preferred surgical airway technique in a young child is transtracheal ventilation using a 14 gauge needle. The age at which one can safely perform a cricothyrotomy on a child is not well established, and recommendations vary from 5 to 12 years old. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When determining whether to perform a cricothyrotomy, consider not only age, but other variables such as the child's size and physical maturity, state of health, external landmarks of the neck (eg, is the cricothyroid membrane palpable?), clinical findings, and presence of trauma.</p><p>Surgical cricothyrotomy is relatively contraindicated in a patient with a bleeding diathesis, but in a life-threatening circumstance the need to establish an airway supersedes this concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2390688\"><span class=\"h2\">Fundamental considerations for the clinician</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a failed airway is recognized and a cricothyrotomy is contemplated, the clinician must address a few fundamental considerations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will a cricothyrotomy effectively bypass the airway obstruction? As an example, if the obstruction is in the distal trachea, performing a cricothyrotomy becomes a critical waste of time that will render any non-invasive ventilation technique ineffective. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which cricothyrotomy technique is to be used? In most cases, the emergency clinician should be familiar with the tools available in their institution to perform cricothyrotomy and should have selected and practiced a preferred technique ahead of time. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will the patient's anterior neck anatomy make the procedure particularly difficult or time consuming? If so, then plan accordingly. As an example, a percutaneous guidewire based technique (rather than an open technique) might be more appropriate in a morbidly obese patient with anatomic landmarks that are difficult to appreciate. </p><p/><p>A mnemonic for difficult cricothyrotomy is presented in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67468 \">table 1</a>). Management of the difficult and failed airway is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient counseling and informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergency conditions under which this procedure is performed generally preclude the discussion of risks, benefits, and complications with the patient or family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful performance of a cricothyrotomy depends on familiarity with the necessary equipment. Keep the cricothyrotomy equipment tray simple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62233\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62233 \">picture 1</a>), in contrast to the typical tracheostomy tray, which may contain dozens of instruments. Only a few instruments are required. Practice using the equipment several times a year so it will be familiar during an emergency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV catheter &ndash; Be certain that an IV is in place and flushing easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; Administer high flow oxygen. In the setting of a failed airway, this will likely be via a bag-valve mask. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilator and tubing &ndash; Be sure the ventilator is set up and ready for use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yankauer suction catheter, tubing, and canister &ndash; Check that all connections are tight and suction is adequate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalpels &ndash; Preferred sizes include numbers 11, 15, and 20 blades. Use the same blade for both the skin incision and the cricothyroid membrane incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal hook &ndash; Handle the tracheal hook carefully when inserting and removing it. The hook's tip is sharp and can puncture the balloon on the tracheostomy tube causing a leak and necessitating replacement. The tip of the hook can also puncture a glove and skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal dilator (Trousseau dilator) &ndash; The dilator is used to widen the opening through the cricothyroid membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Unlike standard scissors or needle drivers, the dilator is opened by squeezing the handles together.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cuffed tracheostomy tube &ndash; Note that tracheostomy tubes vary. A standard tracheostomy tube kit often includes a tube with an inner cannula as well as a solid obturator. Place the obturator in the tracheostomy tube and use it to insert the tube into the trachea. After the tube is placed, remove the obturator and replace it with the inner cannula for air exchange. In an adult a number 4 or 6 cuffed Shiley tube is used most often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Remember that a smaller diameter increases the work of breathing and is more easily obstructed by secretions. However, the cricothyroid membrane averages only 9 mm by 30 mm, so whenever possible the outer diameter of the tube should not exceed 9 mm to avoid damage to surrounding cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number 4 Shiley tube with an inner diameter of 5 mm and an outer diameter of 9.4 mm is a good choice for most adults. However, recognize that the outer diameter of the tube is what determines whether the tube fits properly. There is significant product variability even among Shiley brand tubes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative tube (modified endotracheal tube) &ndash; If a tracheostomy tube is not available, use a standard endotracheal tube cut to an appropriate length. To shorten the tube, remove the adaptor and cut just above the take-off of the pilot balloon tubing. Reattach the adaptor to the newly cut end and insert the tube into the trachea, as you would a tracheostomy tube. The tube can be shortened after it is inserted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Shortening the tube reduces the risk of inadvertent placement in a mainstem bronchus. Eventually, it may be helpful to replace the modified endotracheal tube with a tracheostomy tube, as the design of the tracheostomy tube makes it more stable in the airway. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 mL syringe &ndash; Test the balloon on the tracheostomy or endotracheal tube for leaks by injecting 10 mL of air.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cloth tie &ndash; The cloth tie included with the tracheostomy kit is used to secure the tube by making a circumferential tie around the neck.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE CRICOTHYROID MEMBRANE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper performance of a cricothyrotomy depends upon an understanding of the relevant anatomy and the ability to identify the cricothyroid membrane (CTM). This requires regular practice on the part of clinicians expected to perform the procedure.</p><p>One way to improve one's familiarity with the anatomy is to regularly palpate the structures of the anterior neck when examining patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86138\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86138 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82088 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54025 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86096 \">figure 4</a>). Begin by palpating the laryngeal prominence, which forms the superior edge of the thyroid cartilage. There is often a prominent &quot;V-shaped&quot; notch palpable. It is often more prominent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The vocal cords are housed within and protected by the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone lies cephalad to the thyroid cartilage. In patients where the thyroid cartilage is not prominent be aware that the hyoid might be mistaken for the thyroid prominence.</p><p>Palpate the trachea and note that it is the caudal continuation of the larynx and no longer palpable as it enters the mediastinum. The trachea is comprised in large part by a row of C-shaped cartilaginous rings that are deficient posteriorly where the trachea rests against the anterior esophagus. </p><p>Next, identify and palpate the cricoid cartilage, which is a complete cartilaginous ring, shaped like a signet ring, with its widest part found posteriorly. It is located caudal to the thyroid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and tracheal rings support and protect the airway.</p><p>The boundaries of the cricothyroid membrane (CTM) are the thyroid cartilage superiorly, the cricoid cartilage inferiorly, and the cricothyroideus muscles laterally on both sides. Palpate the CTM. It is located about 2 cm caudal to the laryngeal prominence and can be identified by a slight depression in this area. The anatomical relationship between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages and the CTM is the most important landmark when performing cricothyrotomy.</p><p>The cricothyroid arteries are branches of the superior thyroid arteries that course along both sides of the CTM and anastomose in the midline, closer to the superior border of the membrane. Try to avoid these arteries (this can be difficult) when performing a cricothyrotomy by incising the membrane in its inferior third.</p><p>Some authors imply that identification of the CTM is relatively straightforward, due to its superficial location in the anterior neck. However, lack of familiarity can make it difficult to find the CTM quickly, particularly in the setting of an airway emergency. Obesity compounds this problem. Misidentification can lead clinicians to make incisions in the thyrohyoid space, which is fraught with potential complications. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-morbidly-obese-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the morbidly obese patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several studies highlight the potential difficulty of identifying the CTM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In one prospective observational study, anesthesiologists and obstetricians were asked to identify the CTM in 56 women patients, 15 of whom were obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The CTM was correctly identified in 10 of 41 nonobese patients (20 percent) and 0 of 15 obese patients (0 percent). A similar study involving six patients reported that anesthesiologists correctly identified the CTM 30 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A study of three widely promulgated techniques for identifying the CTM performed in 50 volunteer adult patients reported that none was sufficiently accurate (accuracy ranged from 50 to 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40058161\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND FOR CRICOTHYROTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedside ultrasound has been proposed as a method for identifying the CTM. Ultrasound has been used to guide tracheostomy and the results of several observational studies in cadavers and patients suggest that when used by experienced practitioners it is a rapid and accurate means for identifying the CTM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. However, clinical studies of ultrasound to identify the CTM for cricothyrotomy have yet to be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use standard precautions to protect against blood and body fluid exposure. This includes gloves, face mask, protective eyewear, gown, and shoe covers. Do not break, bend, or recap needles used in the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Place the patient in the supine position on the stretcher. Unless there is a cervical spine injury (known or suspected), extend the patient's neck to help identify the procedural landmarks and to obtain the widest exposure of the cricothyroid membrane. However, it is important to keep in mind that cricothyrotomy is guided primarily by palpation rather than direct visualization. </p><p>While assembling the equipment for the procedure, ask an assistant (preferably the respiratory therapist) to preoxygenate the patient by administering high-flow oxygen most likely via bag valve mask. Be aware that once the incision is made into the airway bag mask ventilations should be discontinued as this can insufflate the soft tissues of the neck and expel blood into the face of the operator. Either result will complicate the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia and sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under emergency circumstances there may not be time to administer sedative or analgesic medications. The most important goal is to secure the airway. In the case of respiratory depression or arrest, sedation may make matters worse and is not advised. However, if the patient is agitated and struggling and this behavior is impeding the progress of the procedure, a sedative or analgesic medication can be given to help control the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If time permits, prepare the skin of the anterior neck with an antiseptic solution (eg, povidone-iodine). If the patient is conscious, anesthetize the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and the cricothyroid membrane with a local anesthetic such as 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> administered through a 27 or 30 gauge needle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitor heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Lower the patient's gown and sheet to observe the rise and fall of the chest with respiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several techniques for cricothyrotomy are in common use. Performance of the Standard, Rapid Four Step, and Seldinger techniques are described here: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard technique</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 1: Immobilize the larynx and palpate the cricothyroid membrane</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69793 \">figure 5</a>) &ndash; Stand at the patient's right side if you are right-handed, or at the patient's left side if you are left-handed. Immobilize the larynx with the nondominant hand and perform the procedure with the dominant hand.<br/><br/>The procedure is largely tactile, so proper finger position is essential. Place the thumb and long finger of the nondominant hand on either side of the thyroid cartilage to immobilize the larynx. Palpate the laryngeal prominence at the midline of the cephalad rim of the thyroid cartilage with the index finger and then move caudally 1 to 2 cm until a small depression inferior to the thyroid cartilage is encountered. This is the cricothyroid membrane. Palpate the cricoid cartilage which is at the inferior border of the cricothyroid membrane. Maintain manual control and immobilization of the larynx throughout the procedure to preserve the anatomic relationships (ie, don't let go!).<br/><br/>Proper stabilization and continuous palpation of the immobilized larynx serves as the foundation for the procedure, from which all other anatomic relationships are established. While immobilizing the larynx, palpate the cricothyroid membrane and complete the entire procedure by feel. Do not waste time attempting to visualize the cricothyroid membrane. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 2: Incise the skin vertically</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82644 \">figure 6</a>) &ndash; After palpating the cricothyroid membrane, make a midline, <strong>vertical</strong> incision 3 to 5 cm long through the skin overlying the membrane. The midline skin incision avoids vascular structures located laterally. The vertical orientation allows one to extend the incision superiorly or inferiorly should the initial location be too high or too low or provide inadequate access to the cricothyroid membrane. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 3: Incise the cricothyroid membrane horizontally</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71670 \">figure 7</a>) &ndash; Make a 1 cm <strong>horizontal</strong> incision in the cricothyroid membrane. Make the incision with care; excessive force can lead to injury of the posterior wall of the trachea. Aim the scalpel in a caudad direction to avoid the vocal cords. The cords, although surrounded by the thyroid cartilage and partially protected, are located only 0.5 to 2 cm above the cricothyroid membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While separating the thyroid cartilage from the cricoid cartilage, be careful not to incise or fracture either one.<br/><br/>Once you have made the incision in the cricothyroid membrane, keep the tip of the index finger of the nondominant hand in the entry to the incision so as not to lose the opening. Continue to immobilize the larynx firmly, maintaining a triangle formed by the thumb and middle finger on opposite sides of the larynx and the index finger in the incision in the cricothyroid membrane. It is crucial not to let go at this point because there is often significant bleeding that obscures the view of the membrane.<br/><br/>If you are unable to stabilize the larynx because of obesity, edema, trauma, aberrant anatomy, or other reasons, you may wish to leave the scalpel in the incision until you place the tracheal hook in order not to lose the opening. In this case, be careful not to injure the back wall of the trachea with the scalpel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 4: Insert the tracheal hook</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79117 \">figure 8</a>) &ndash; Place the tracheal hook under the thyroid cartilage and ask an assistant to provide upward traction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 5: Insert the Trousseau dilator and open it</strong> <strong>to enlarge the incision vertically</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68235 \">figure 9</a>) &ndash; Squeeze the handles of the dilator to open its jaws. The membrane is naturally wider in the horizontal direction, which makes the vertical direction the hardest to dilate. Overcome the resistance from the thyroid cartilage as it retracts downward and the cricoid cartilage as it retracts upward against the dilator. Leave the dilator in until the tube is placed; the thyroid and cricoid cartilages will spring back into place if the dilator is removed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 6: Insert the tracheostomy tube</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58528 \">figure 10</a>) &ndash; After dilating the opening, rotate the dilator 90 degrees so that the handles are pointing towards the patient's feet and insert the tube between the jaws of the Trousseau dilator. If the dilator remains in its original horizontal position, its inferior blade will prevent the tube from passing into the trachea. Once past the blades, advance the tube into the trachea. Remove the tracheal hook and Trousseau dilator. Pay particular attention not to puncture the balloon of the tube when withdrawing the sharp point of the tracheal hook.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 7: Remove the obturator</strong> (as needed, depending on type of tube used)&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78841 \">figure 11</a>) &ndash; This is the solid object with a rounded tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 8: Insert the inner cannula</strong> (as needed, depending on type of tube used) and inflate the balloon&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55500\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55500 \">figure 12</a>) - Inflate the cuff of the tube with air from a 10 mL syringe.

For this technique, stand at the head of the patient in the same position as when performing endotracheal intubation. Next, perform the following four steps in sequence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the cricothyroid membrane by palpation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69793 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a horizontal stab incision through both skin and cricothyroid membrane with the scalpel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72479\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72479 \">figure 14</a>). The size of the skin incision is approximately 1 to 2 cm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 3:</strong> Prior to removal of the scalpel, the hook is placed and directed inferiorly. Caudal traction is used to stabilize the larynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63765 \">figure 15</a>). This marks a significant change from the standard method, in which the tracheal hook is placed under the thyroid cartilage. Also in contrast with the Standard technique, this step does not require an assistant to manage the hook. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 4:</strong> Insert the tracheostomy tube into the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70976\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70976 \">figure 16</a>).</p><p/><p>The RFST can be modified by using a tracheal tube introducer (often referred to as a &quot;bougie&quot;). This is done by inserting the introducer through the incision into the trachea following step 3 above and then sliding a tracheal tube over the introducer. </p><p>In a small randomized trial performed in anesthetized sheep by inexperienced clinicians, this modified approach increased the speed of performance (median time 67 versus 149 seconds) and was considered easier to perform than the Standard technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Seldinger technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cricothyrotomy using a Seldinger technique has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Commercial cricothyrotomy kits are available that contain all essential equipment to perform the Seldinger technique. As an example, the Cook Melker kit includes the following: a 6 mL syringe, an 18 gauge needle with overlying catheter, a guide wire, a tissue dilator, a modified airway catheter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75579\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75579 \">picture 2</a>), and tracheostomy tape. Alternatively, a tracheal tube introducer (ie, &quot;bougie&quot;) can be used to perform the technique, as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Emergency surgical cricothyrotomy has a much higher complication rate than elective cricothyrotomy. This is likely because emergency cricothyrotomy is performed on critically ill patients with difficult airways under emergency conditions. In such cases, a higher complication rate is acceptable given the risk of death if the airway cannot be established.</p><p>Bleeding occurs early and is not usually severe.

The cricoid cartilage is vulnerable to injury with this technique because the tracheal hook is placed under the anterior portion where it is weakest and thinnest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, a cadaver based study reported that the cricoid ring was able to tolerate the degree of manipulation required for intubation without cartilage fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>In one study comparing complications of the RFST and the standard technique, the same overall rate of complications (38 percent) was observed for both, but the incidence of major complications (eg, complete transection of the cricoid cartilage, posterior tracheal or esophageal perforation) was 6 percent higher for the RFST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other researchers studied complications rates when both techniques were performed on cadavers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. They observed no complications with the standard technique but a 16.7 percent complication rate with the RFST. Four of these injuries were to the cricoid cartilage. The remaining complication was a ruptured cuff, which may be attributable to the caudal placement of the tracheal hook beside the cuff, and highlights the importance of removing the hook carefully or using a blunt hook for the RFST.</p><p>Long-term complications include subglottic stenosis and voice changes. Subglottic stenosis has been associated with prolonged intubation, underlying laryngeal disease, and younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>There is limited data regarding the safety of cricothyrotomy in patients with known or suspected cervical spine injury.
