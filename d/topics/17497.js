The fluid normally goes away when a baby is born. In some babies, the fluid does not go away as quickly as it should. This causes TTN.</p><p>A mother who has diabetes, asthma, or a c-section without labor is more likely to have a baby with TTN. A c-section is also called a &quot;cesarean delivery.&quot; It is a type of surgery used to deliver a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424371\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of TTN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually happen within 2 hours after birth. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast breathing &ndash; More than 60 breaths a minute. This is more than 1 breath every second.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks blue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hard breathing &ndash; This can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nostrils that open wide when the baby takes a breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin and muscles that look like they are caving in &ndash; This can happen between the baby's ribs or under the baby's ribcage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grunting when the baby breathes out</p><p/><p>Symptoms of TTN usually last 12 to 72 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424386\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for TTN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no single test. The doctor or nurse can often tell if a baby has TTN by doing an exam.</p><p>Other conditions can cause breathing problems similar to TTN. These include serious conditions such as pneumonia. The doctor can order a chest X-ray that shows changes in the lungs. Looking at the X-ray can help the doctor learn if a baby has TTN or a different condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424400\"><span class=\"h1\">How is TTN treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN usually goes away by the time a baby is 3 days old. Until that happens, doctors can help the baby get enough oxygen and nutrition if he or she needs it. Treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra oxygen &ndash; This helps make sure the baby has enough oxygen in his or her blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperature control &ndash; This keeps the baby from getting too hot or too cold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeding tube or &quot;IV&quot; &ndash; If the baby has trouble breathing, he or she might not be able to nurse or drink from a bottle. A feeding tube is a small tube that goes into the baby's mouth or nose, down the throat, and into the stomach. It can be used to put breast milk or formula right into the baby's stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An IV is a thin tube that goes into a vein. It can carry a sugar mixture into the baby's bloodstream.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These are medicines to keep infections from happening or stop them if they do happen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23424415\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-newborn-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in newborn babies (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
