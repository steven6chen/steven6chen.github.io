This topic will provide an overview of major issues related to breech presentation, including the best approach for delivery. Techniques for breech delivery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of the fetus in breech presentation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523783333\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BREECH PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main types of breech presentation are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frank breech</strong> &ndash; In the frank breech position, both hips are flexed and both knees are extended so that the feet are adjacent to the fetal head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71398\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71398 \">figure 1</a>). At term, 50 to 70 percent of breech fetuses are in this position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete breech</strong> &ndash; In the complete breech position, both hips and both knees are flexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77224 \">figure 2</a>). At term, 5 to 10 percent of breech fetuses are in this position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incomplete breech</strong> &ndash; In the incomplete breech position, one or both hips are <strong>not</strong> completely flexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68254\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68254 \">figure 3</a>). At term, 10 to 40 percent of breech fetuses are incomplete.</p><p/><p>The presenting part may be the buttocks, one or both feet (ie, footling breech) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102733\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef102733 \">image 1</a>), or, rarely, one or both knees (ie, kneeling breech).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523783351\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the hips are flexed and the knees are extended or flexed in the frank and complete breech presentations, the thighs and trunk pass through the birth canal simultaneously. If this large presenting part passes through the birth canal easily, then the aftercoming shoulders and head are likely to pass through easily as well, but a difficult delivery is still possible.</p><p>In contrast, one or both hips are not flexed in an incomplete breech; therefore, one or both feet or knees may easily slip through an incompletely dilated cervix or an inadequate pelvis leading to entrapment of the shoulders or head because of their much larger diameters. This increases the risks of hypoxic injury and delivery-related trauma. In addition, a foot or knee presentation provides space for umbilical cord prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of breech presentation decreases with increasing gestational age. It is a common occurrence in early pregnancy when the fetus is highly mobile within a relatively large volume of amniotic fluid. Twenty to 25 percent of fetuses under 28 weeks are breech, but only 7 to 16 percent are breech at 32 weeks, and only 3 to 4 percent are breech at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most pregnancies, breech presentation appears to be a chance occurrence. In up to 15 percent of cases, however, it may be due to fetal, maternal, or placental abnormalities. It is hypothesized that a fetus with normal anatomy, activity, amniotic fluid volume, and placental location adopts the cephalic presentation near term because this position is the best fit for the intrauterine space, but if any of these variables is abnormal, then breech presentation is more likely. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784245\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for breech presentation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm gestation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous breech presentation (see <a href=\"#H523784429\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrence'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine abnormality (eg, bicornuate or septate uterus, fibroid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental abnormality (eg, placenta previa, cornual placenta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiparity resulting in a lax abdominal wall and more rounded intrauterine space</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contracted maternal pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal anomaly (eg, anencephaly, hydrocephaly, sacrococcygeal teratoma, neck mass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended fetal legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crowding from multiple gestation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal neurologic impairment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primiparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal anticonvulsant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784429\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In population-based registries, the frequency of breech presentation in a second pregnancy was about 2 percent if the first pregnancy was not a breech presentation and about 9 percent if the first pregnancy was a breech presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. After two consecutive pregnancies with breech presentation at delivery, the risk of another breech presentation was about 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and after three consecutive breech deliveries, the risk was almost 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In addition, parents who themselves were delivered at term from breech presentation were twice as likely to have firstborn offspring in breech presentation as parents who were delivered in cephalic presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This suggests a possible heritable component to fetal presentation that can be transmitted from either parent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS AND COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of breech presentation are best appreciated in the third trimester. Clinical assessment for fetal presentation should be a routine part of prenatal examination in late pregnancy since breech presentation affects delivery management. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choosing the route of delivery at term'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784588\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women carrying a fetus in breech presentation often report subcostal discomfort due to the fetal head in the fundus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. They may also perceive kicking in the lower abdomen when the breech is complete or incomplete. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784594\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On transabdominal examination, breech presentation is characterized by the presence of a soft mass (ie, buttocks) and the absence of a hard fetal skull in the lower uterine segment. In addition, a hollow (fetal neck) next to the presenting part is absent in a breech presentation and palpable in a cephalic presentation. </p><p>In breech presentation, the fetal head in the upper part of the uterus is readily balloted since it pivots on the neck and moves independently from the trunk. By comparison, in cephalic presentation, ballottement of the breech in the upper part of the uterus is characteristically sluggish because it is accompanied by movement of the entire trunk. </p><p>On transvaginal examination, the soft buttocks, anal orifice, or feet may be identified when the cervix is dilated, but can be difficult to palpate when the cervix is closed. A foot is differentiated from a hand by the presence of the heel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784647\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound clearly identifies the fetal head in the fundus, buttocks in the lower uterine segment, extension or flexion of each hip and knee, and location of each foot. </p><p>Hyperextension of the fetal head (defined by an extension angle greater than 90 degrees) is an important finding as it is a contraindication to vaginal delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of the fetus in breech presentation&quot;, section on 'Criteria for an optimal patient selection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784568\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous version may occur at any time before delivery, even after 40 weeks of gestation. A prospective longitudinal study using serial ultrasound examination reported the likelihood of spontaneous version to cephalic presentation after 36 weeks was 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Characteristics that lower the likelihood of spontaneous version include extended fetal legs, oligohydramnios, short umbilical cord, primiparity, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/uterine</span> abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784549\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of breech presentation on transabdominal or transvaginal physical examination or ultrasound examination is diagnostic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523784671\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform ultrasound examination to confirm suspected breech presentation and type of breech when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain and this information will affect management. For example, ultrasound confirmation of breech presentation at or near term should prompt a discussion of external cephalic version. Antepartum clinical diagnosis of breech presentation is not infallible. In a study in which an experienced clinician examined 138 women at 30 to 41 weeks of gestation immediately before an ultrasound examination, the examiner identified only three of eight breech presentations, and falsely diagnosed six breeches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Clinical examination is fallible because characteristic transabdominal breech findings may be obscured or distorted by maternal obesity, full bladder, leiomyoma, polyhydramnios, anterior placenta, or multiple gestation. </p><p>In a laboring patient, confirmation of previously unsuspected breech presentation should prompt a discussion about cesarean versus vaginal delivery. Intrapartum transvaginal examination through a dilated cervix is more accurate than transabdominal examination, but is also fallible because a frank breech presentation has some findings similar to those found with an edematous face presentation. A useful distinguishing characteristic is that the fetal greater trochanters and anal orifice form a straight line in the buttocks, whereas the malar bones and mouth form a triangle in the face. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=face-and-brow-presentations-in-labor#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Face and brow presentations in labor&quot;, section on 'Face presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING THE ROUTE OF DELIVERY AT TERM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four strategies for delivery of the term breech fetus have evolved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External cephalic rotation before labor, with a trial of labor if the version is successful and cesarean delivery if unsuccessful. This is the most common approach in the United States and many other countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External cephalic rotation before labor, with a trial of labor if the version is successful. If the version is unsuccessful, a trial of labor and vaginal breech birth is offered to patients who have characteristics that are believed to place them at a low risk of labor and delivery related complications. Cesarean delivery is offered to higher-risk patients and any patient who declines to attempt vaginal breech birth. This is the author's approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned cesarean delivery for breech presentation, without a trial of external cephalic version.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of labor and vaginal breech birth for patients who have characteristics that are believed to place them at a low risk of labor and delivery related complications, without a trial of external cephalic version.</p><p/><p>There is general agreement that the breech fetus is at higher risk for asphyxia and traumatic injury during vaginal delivery than the cephalic presenting fetus (see <a href=\"#H523783351\" class=\"local\">'Significance'</a> above). To minimize the risk of these complications, the choice of delivery route for the term breech fetus is guided by patient values and preferences and provider experience, values, and preferences, taking into account the risks and benefits of the various approaches. The mother's choice of mode of birth should be informed by unbiased, noncohesive counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The choice should be made with due consideration of specific healthcare environments, individual women, and the limitations inherent in the data described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91099917\"><span class=\"h2\">External cephalic version with cesarean delivery of the persistent breech</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External cephalic version at or near term, followed by a trial of vaginal delivery if the version is successful and planned cesarean delivery if breech presentation persists is the preferred approach to delivery of the term breech fetus in the United States, and many other countries. Patients are encouraged to undergo external cephalic version to convert a breech presentation to cephalic presentation and thus increase the likelihood of vaginal cephalic birth. In a 2015 meta-analysis of randomized trials, external cephalic version at term resulted in a 60 percent reduction in non-cephalic presentation at birth (relative risk [RR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.61) and a 40 percent reduction in cesarean delivery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Performing the version at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation and using a tocolytic drug increase the likelihood of success. These data and the technique for external cephalic version are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-cephalic-version\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External cephalic version&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Planned cesarean delivery for persistent term breech presentation is associated with a clinically significant decrease in <span class=\"nowrap\">perinatal/neonatal</span> mortality and neonatal morbidity, with only a modest increase in short-term maternal morbidity, compared with a policy of planned vaginal delivery. It should be performed after 39 weeks of gestation to allow optimal neurological maturation (unless there are specific indications for earlier delivery). Delaying cesarean delivery is particularly important where the indication is breech presentation, as spontaneous version may occur at any gestational age.</p><p>However, a policy of planned cesarean delivery may not be affordable or feasible in resource-poor settings. On an individual-case basis, there may be clinical situations in which the maternal risks of cesarean or the mother's desire to avoid cesarean delivery outweigh the newborn's short-term risks of vaginal birth. Both routes of delivery have similar long-term maternal and childhood outcomes and some data suggest some long-term health benefits to being born vaginally, including reduced risk of childhood conditions such as asthma and arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In addition, cesarean delivery has implications for women planning future pregnancies including repeat cesarean delivery and increased risks of placenta accreta and uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Lastly, the randomized trials (discussed below) that were the basis of current policies for planned cesarean delivery included fewer than 3000 women. Increasing the magnitude of planned cesarean deliveries worldwide will increase the absolute number of women who develop rare but life-threatening complications of this major operative procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H910657072\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence supporting planned cesarean delivery was provided by a systematic review of randomized trials of planned cesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery for term breech presentation (three trials, 2396 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In two of the trials, which were from the same unit, women with frank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] or non-frank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] breech presentation were randomly assigned to undergo planned cesarean delivery or a protocol allowing vaginal delivery within prescribed limitations, including the absence of diminished pelvic dimensions on radiographic pelvimetry. The third trial, the Term Breech Trial, was a large (n = 2088 participants) multicenter, international trial comparing planned cesarean delivery with planned vaginal delivery by an experienced clinician following agreed upon clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The participating countries were classified as having low or high perinatal mortality rates (low = less than 20 per 1000 live births plus late fetal deaths, high = 20 or more). Cesarean delivery was performed in 550 of 1227 women (45 percent) allocated to the vaginal delivery protocol.</p><p>The key findings were as follows. </p><p>Compared with planned vaginal birth of breech presentation, planned cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">perinatal/neonatal</span> death (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.86). Risk ratios were similar for countries with low versus high national perinatal mortality rates, but absolute mortality rates were higher in the latter. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced composite short-term outcome of <span class=\"nowrap\">perinatal/neonatal</span> death or serious neonatal morbidity (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.56). This result was largely driven by data from countries with low national perinatal mortality rates, where the comparative risk of the composite outcome was RR 0.07 (95% CI 0.02-0.29; <span class=\"nowrap\">4/1000</span> for planned cesarean delivery versus <span class=\"nowrap\">57/1000</span> for planned vaginal delivery). In countries with high national perinatal mortality rates, the comparative risk of the composite outcome was RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.35-1.24; <span class=\"nowrap\">29/1000</span> for planned cesarean delivery versus <span class=\"nowrap\">44/1000</span> for planned vaginal delivery). The unexpectedly low absolute composite <span class=\"nowrap\">mortality/morbidity</span> rate with planned vaginal delivery in high perinatal mortality rate countries may have been due to less macrosomia, more experience with vaginal breech delivery, and documentation issues in these countries. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The numbers in the meta-analysis were too small to show statistical reductions in birth trauma and brachial plexus injury with planned cesarean delivery. </p><p/><p>In addition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Route of planned delivery had no significant effect on long-term outcome in offspring, except that infant medical problems were significantly increased following planned cesarean delivery. The combined risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">death/neurodevelopmental</span> delay was similar for the planned vaginal and planned cesarean groups at two years of age. Since there were few serious adverse events despite the large number of study participants and 17 of 18 neonates with serious early morbidity were neurologically normal at two years of age, a small difference between groups in long-term composite <span class=\"nowrap\">mortality/morbidity</span> cannot be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Route of planned delivery had no significant effect on long-term maternal outcome. In the short-term, planned cesarean resulted in a small increase in some maternal morbidities (eg, hemorrhage, transfusion, infection), but less urinary incontinence and incontinence of flatus. Complications in future pregnancies related to scarring of the uterus were not assessed.</p><p/><p>Large cohort studies support these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p>The Term Breech Trial impacted clinical practice worldwide: The rate of planned vaginal breech birth fell substantially since publication of this trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The cesarean delivery rate for breech presentation in European countries is now &ge;70 percent, and approximately 95 percent in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Limited data suggest that this fall in planned vaginal breech birth has been accompanied by a fall in the morbidity and mortality of breech delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46</a>], especially if performed before labor begins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. It is estimated that 338 cesareans for breech presentation need to be performed to prevent one perinatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H467952673\"><span class=\"h2\">External cephalic version with vaginal breech delivery for selected patients with a persistent breech</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author's preference is to offer external cephalic version followed by trial of vaginal birth if successful.

This opinion is supported primarily by data from observational studies, as data from randomized trials are sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>In a 2014 systematic review of seven observational studies (n = 3557 women) that evaluated cesarean versus vaginal delivery of the preterm breech, the weighted risk of neonatal mortality was lower in the cesarean delivery group than in the vaginal birth group (3.8 versus 11.5 percent; pooled relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In one of the included studies, a retrospective study of women delivering breech infants at 26 to 29 weeks of gestation, the rate of head entrapment was twofold higher in the planned vaginal delivery group than in the planned cesarean delivery group <span class=\"nowrap\">(11/84</span> [13 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">5/85</span> [6 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Four neonatal deaths were attributed to head entrapment; three of these infants were delivered vaginally and died within an hour of birth (neonatal death related to head entrapment <span class=\"nowrap\">3/45</span> vaginal deliveries versus <span class=\"nowrap\">1/124</span> cesarean deliveries). The single infant that died after cesarean delivery complicated by head entrapment died five days later because of sepsis and grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage. Of note, approximately 50 percent of planned vaginal deliveries ended in cesarean birth, while 6 percent of planned cesareans ended in vaginal birth.</p><p>The authors of the systematic review subsequently published a cohort study including over 8300 women with a singleton preterm pregnancy in breech presentation who delivered at 26<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks of gestation in the Netherlands from 2000 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. A strength of this study is the large number of women who intended to deliver vaginally (n = 6421), although 2995 of these women delivered by emergency cesarean during labor.&nbsp;Compared with intended vaginal delivery, intended cesarean delivery was not associated with a significant reduction in perinatal mortality (1.3 versus 1.5 percent, adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.60-1.57) or the composite outcome perinatal <span class=\"nowrap\">mortality/severe</span> morbidity (3.2 versus 4.1 percent, adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03); however, when minor morbidities such as five-minute Apgar score less than 7 were also considered, intended cesarean delivery reduced the rate of the composite outcome perinatal <span class=\"nowrap\">mortality/morbidity</span> (8.7 versus 10.4 percent, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.93). A subgroup analysis based on gestational age found that perinatal mortality, morbidity, and severe morbidity were significantly reduced at 28 to 32 weeks of gestation. These data add to the body of evidence that vaginal delivery of the very preterm breech fetus is likely associated with a small but significant increase in adverse outcome that can be avoided by cesarean birth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE FOR BREECH DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-the-fetus-in-breech-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of the fetus in breech presentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91100809\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates who were breech in utero are more at risk for mild deformations (eg, frontal bossing, prominent occiput, upward slant and low-set ears), torticollis, and developmental dysplasia of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-issues-related-to-breech-presentation/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

Both routes of delivery have similar long-term maternal and childhood outcomes and some data suggest some long-term health benefits to being born vaginally.
