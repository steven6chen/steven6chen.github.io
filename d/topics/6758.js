In 2002, a prenatal ultrasound was performed in approximately two-thirds of all live births in the United States. The frequency of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) as detected sonographically in unselected populations has been reported to be between 0.1 to 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>In general, the optimal timing recommended for a screening antenatal ultrasound is between 16 to 20 weeks of gestation because of the following factors at this gestational age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is good visualization of anatomy with a high sensitivity in detecting anomalies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is early enough in the pregnancy to allow completion of prenatal diagnostic procedures (eg, fetal karyotype, additional imaging studies) while legal termination of pregnancy is possible, if desired.</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between the 12th and 15th week of gestation, the fetal kidney can be detected by transabdominal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On transverse ultrasound images, normal fetal kidneys are hypoechoic ovoid masses located in the renal fossa on either side of the spine corresponding to the level of the second lumbar vertebrae. The renal cortex and medulla are distinctly demonstrated by ultrasound by the 20th to 25th week of gestation. Fetal renal length based upon gestational age is a marker of renal growth and is illustrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74636\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74636 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Normally, the fetal ureters are not seen on ultrasonography. However, if they are visualized, it may be indicative of ureteric or bladder obstruction, or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).</p><p>The urine-filled bladder is normally identified at 13 to 15 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Urine in the bladder suggests at least one functioning kidney. The bladder wall is normally thin. If the bladder wall is thick, urethral obstruction such as posterior urethral valves in a male fetus may be present. If the bladder is not seen, consider the diagnosis of bladder exstrophy.</p><p>The sensitivity of detecting renal malformations by antenatal ultrasonography depends upon the gestational age and the skill of the ultrasonographer. In one study, the sensitivity of antenatal screening for renal malformations was reported as 82 percent at a mean gestational age of 23 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Amniotic fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of amniotic fluid volume and analysis of biochemical markers are used to evaluate fetal renal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fetal urine production begins at nine weeks of gestation, its contribution to amniotic fluid volume becomes significant at the start of the second trimester. By 20 weeks gestation, fetal urine accounts for more than 90 percent of the amniotic fluid volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, a decrease in amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios) at or beyond the 20th week of gestation is an excellent predictor of abnormal fetal renal function and CAKUT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Severe oligohydramnios due to CAKUT either involves both kidneys or occurs in a solitary kidney in the fetus. Bilateral renal agenesis (RA) or severe dysgenesis, bilateral ureteric obstruction, or obstruction of the bladder outlet or urethra can result in severe oligohydramnios as early as 18 weeks gestation. Because an adequate amniotic fluid volume is critical for lung development, severe oligohydramnios due to abnormal fetal renal function in the second trimester can result in lung hypoplasia, a potentially fatal disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In its most severe form, this sequence of events results in Potter's syndrome, which consists of a typical facial appearance characterized by pseudoepicanthus, recessed chin, posteriorly rotated, flattened ears and flattened nose, decreased fetal movement, musculoskeletal features including clubfoot and clubhand, hip dislocation and joint contractures, and pulmonary hypoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72847 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The assessment of amniotic fluid volume is discussed in greater detail separately.

Because amniotic fluid is predominantly composed of fetal urine, measurement of biochemical markers contained in amniotic fluid (fetal urine) can be used to assess fetal renal function.</p><p>With increasing gestational age, renal tubular resorptive function increases. As a result, the urinary levels of sodium and beta-2-microglobulin decrease with increasing gestational age, while urine osmolality increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Impaired resorption is seen in fetuses with bilateral renal dysplasia or severe bilateral obstructive uropathy resulting in abnormal urinary levels of electrolytes, beta-2-microglobulin, and osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In general, high urinary electrolyte excretion, sodium and chloride concentration greater than 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and urinary osmolality less than 210 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> H2O (210 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> H2O) in the amniotic fluid are indicative of fetal renal tubular impairment and poor renal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When analyzing the results, it is important to use gestation specific cut-offs because with increasing gestational age, renal tubular resorptive function increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in a systematic review of fetal urine analysis, none of the urinary tests provide significant clinical accuracy to correctly predict poor postnatal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Tests to assess fetal glomerular function include fetal serum measurement of cystatin C and beta-2-microglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, these tests are not used in clinical practice because of technical difficulties in obtaining fetal blood.</p><p>In addition, amniocentesis can be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities often associated with renal defects such as trisomy 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

If the fetal prognosis is poor, as determined by severe bilateral disease, bilateral RA, oligohydramnios, or unfavorable amniotic fluid analysis, legal termination, if possible, can be offered.</p><p>In all other cases, continued counseling throughout the pregnancy including discussion of postnatal management is required. In particular, discussion with parents regarding their wishes on the level of support given to offspring with severe oligohydramnios, who are at risk for lung hypoplasia that may be incompatible with life, is helpful in establishing guidelines for initial postnatal care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">In utero intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intervening in pregnancy to attempt definitive or temporary correction of fetal renal anomalies would be reasonable if one could prevent the development of renal dysplasia, renal scarring, chronic renal failure, or the occurrence of pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Although there have been case series of antenatal surgery in fetuses with severe hydronephrosis and oligohydramnios, this intervention has not been shown to improve renal outcome. These procedures may increase the amount of amniotic fluid, thus potentially improving lung development and survival rate. In these rare cases, the procedure should only be performed in select centers with expertise and in infants with severe bilateral hydronephrosis, absent of severe renal parenchymal or cystic disease, favorable urinary electrolyte levels and osmolality, and normal karyotype.

As an example, a distended bladder with thickened bladder wall and bilateral hydronephrosis may be caused by posterior urethral valves (PUV) that require surgical intervention.</p><p>Renal growth can be assessed by measuring the renal length with the infant in the prone position.</p><p>In general, conditions, which have unilateral involvement, do not need immediate attention. Renal ultrasonography is recommended after the infant returns to birth weight (after 48 hours of age and within the first week of life) to ensure volume repletion and increased urine output as renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) rise in the first 48 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, in an infant with hydronephrosis, the level of severity might be underestimated if ultrasonography is performed before 48 hours of life. In addition, hydronephrosis may not be present on renal ultrasonography in an infant with obstructive uropathy that has intrinsic anuric renal failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic testing includes measurement of serum creatinine to assess renal function and other radiologic tests that can be useful in determining underlying renal pathology, renal function, and the presence of other urological anomalies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimation of the renal function by measurement of the serum creatinine concentration is used clinically to assess the presence and extent of renal impairment and to follow the infant's renal function.

It declines to normal values (serum creatinine 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [27 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> in approximately one week in term infants and two to three weeks in preterm infants. Serum creatinine should be measured after the first 24 hours to avoid overestimation of creatinine that may be high and reflective of maternal creatinine values.

It requires urethral catheterization and injection of a contrast agent. Indications include any suspicion of a thick-walled bladder, ureteric dilatation, hydronephrosis, and in male infants, any urethral pathology (eg, posterior urethral valves) detected by ultrasound.</p><p>VCUG is the definitive study to demonstrate VUR, which often accompanies other CAKUT (eg, multicystic dysplastic, hypoplastic, or ectopic kidney). VUR is detected in as many as 15 percent of infants with antenatal hydronephrosis. Infants with postnatal hydronephrosis (without evidence of another cause of the hydronephrosis) are candidates to undergo VCUG. The decision to perform a VCUG depends on the severity of the hydronephrosis and how a finding of VUR will determine clinical management. Infants who are at high risk for VUR should be given prophylactic antibiotics. Infants with significant VUR demonstrated by VCUG are typically continued on prophylactic antibiotics.

Following intravenous (IV) injection, DMSA is taken up by proximal tubular cells with only a minimal amount excreted in the urine, so the tracer accumulates over several hours within the tubule, providing a static image of functioning nephrons. There is no minimum age at which a DMSA scan can be performed. However, the quality of both dynamic and static radionuclide scans improves with renal maturity.</p><p>DMSA scan is used to assess whether a suspected renal lesion contains normal-functioning nephrons, the differential function of the two kidneys <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detection of renal scarring. If possible, the DMSA renal scan should be performed four to six weeks after birth in a full-term infant as poor function measured by DMSA renal scan does not necessarily imply irreversible damage in a neonate, but may be a reflection of immature renal function.
