The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and underlying condition of the patient, the causative pathogen, the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and, occasionally, to delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complications of bacterial meningitis can be divided into systemic and neurologic. Systemic complications are usually the consequence of the bacteremia that frequently accompanies meningitis.
