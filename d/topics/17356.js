This area of pediatric care presents a critical opportunity for anticipatory guidance; parents need guidance in recognizing signs of readiness, in helping their child achieve the necessary skills, and in addressing problems when they occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The approach to toilet training and common problems in toilet training are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of enuresis and encopresis are discussed separately.

In the early 1900s, techniques for toilet training stressed physiologic readiness, involving the child as a passive participant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During the 1920s and 1930s, early training and rigid scheduling were recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A 1929 &quot;Parents&quot; magazine claimed that most healthy babies could be trained by eight weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By the 1940s, pediatric experts, including Dr. Benjamin Spock, began to advocate that parents wait to begin toilet training until they observed signs of developmental readiness in their children. They believed that rushed, rigid training would be unsuccessful and lead to behavioral problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the early 1960s, two major theories on toilet training emerged: the parent-oriented approach, the major contributors for which were Azrin and Foxx; and the child-directed approach, developed by T Berry Brazelton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>].</p><p>The age at which children begin to toilet-train has increased over time. In a survey study, individuals in Belgium were asked about the toileting habits of children they had trained. The researchers divided the respondents into three groups according to their age: &gt;60 years, 40 to 60 years, and 20 to 40 years. Initiation of daytime toilet training began at less than 18 months of age in 88 percent of the children of respondents who were &gt;60 years of age, 50 percent of respondents in the 40 to 60 age range, and 22 percent of respondents in the 20 to 40 age group. There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of training among the children in any of the three groups. In this study, methods of training also appear to have changed over time, with trainers in the youngest cohort using more than one method to train their children, in comparison to a single method (diaper removal) used by respondents in the &gt;60 age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A cross-sectional survey of parents found racial differences in beliefs concerning the appropriate age to start toilet training. On average, African-American parents believed in starting toilet training at 18 months of age, in comparison with 25 months of age for Caucasian parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of the effectiveness of different methods of toilet training revealed that both the parent-oriented and child-oriented training approaches resulted in quick, successful toilet training among healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The two methods have not been directly compared, and therefore definitive conclusions regarding the superiority of one method over the other cannot be made; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines most closely reflects the child oriented training model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107080454\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age at which most children are considered toilet trained varies by time, culture, and definition of the endpoint of toilet training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The more stringent definitions require children to be continent of bowel and bladder during both day and night and to be able to perform their toileting independently. Less stringent definitions consider children toilet trained when they are continent of urine during the day or when they are able to express their need to eliminate, whether or not they do so independently.</p><p>In the United States, 26 percent of children achieve daytime continence by 24 months of age, 85 percent by 30 months, and 98 percent by 36 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most children achieve bowel and bladder control by 24 to 48 months of age; in 1947, most children achieved this milestone at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a report of 320 Swiss children; complete bowel and bladder control were found in 5 percent of two-year-olds, 11 percent of three-year-olds, 77 percent of four-year-olds, and 91 percent of six-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In comparison, the Digo people in East Africa begin toilet training their infants during the first weeks of life, relying on nearly continuous contact with the caregiver and dependence on the caregiver to recognize subtle cues given by the infant prior to elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They achieve stooling and urination on command by the time the child is four to five months old.</p><p>Most children achieve bowel control before or at the same time as daytime bladder control; bladder control is achieved first in 10 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. Nighttime bladder control is achieved months to years later and is not expected until five to seven years of age.</p><p>The average length of time required to achieve toilet training is six months for daytime urinary continence and six to seven months for stool continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Earlier initiation (before 27 months of age) is correlated with a longer duration of toilet training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Girls complete the toilet-training process earlier than do boys (eg, two to three months earlier in a large retrospective study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/13,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17-19</a>]. First children take longer to toilet train than do subsequent siblings (eg, two months longer in a large retrospective study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A cross-sectional survey of parents of children between the ages of 15 and 42 months in Milwaukee demonstrated that older age of child, non-Caucasian race, female sex, and single parenthood were significant predictors of toilet-training completion, rather than a child's temperament and developmental stage. In this same study, 50 percent of the African-American parents, compared with 4 percent of the Caucasian parents, agreed that it was important that a child be trained by two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In a prospective longitudinal study, three factors were identified that consistently were associated with toilet training completion at a later age: initiation of training at an older age, presence of stool toileting refusal, and presence of frequent constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Parent-oriented training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parent-oriented approach is based upon structural-behavioral training and operant conditioning. The complete method was published in 1974 in &quot;Toilet Training in Less Than a Day&quot; and consists of speed training, using four basic concepts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased fluid intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regularly scheduled toilet times</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive reinforcement for correct elimination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overcorrection for accidents (eg, verbal reprimands or time out from positive reinforcement)</p><p/><p>The method was first used on institutionalized intellectually disabled adults, then repeated on 34 children who were older than 20 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The children were toilet trained in a mean time of 3.9 hours (range: 0.5 to 14 hours). Subsequent studies reported behavioral problems, including tantrums and unsuccessful toileting outcomes, unless the use of the book was accompanied by group training, lectures, written instructions, and close supervision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The major drawbacks of this method are the risk of inadvertently conditioning the child to perform incorrect behaviors and the possibility of physical abuse occurring during the overcorrection component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Two variations of parent-oriented methods of toilet training (timed potty training and a daytime wetting alarm) were compared in a randomized controlled trial in 39 children aged 20 to 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children in the timed potty-training group were brought to the potty four times per day and encouraged to void. Parents of children in the alarm group were instructed to put them on the potty when the moisture-sensitive alarm sounded and encourage them to finish voiding. Parents of both groups were asked to use positive reinforcement and refrain from negative reinforcement. More children in the alarm than in the timed group were completely dry after five days of training and one month later (78 versus 41 percent and 89 versus 53 percent, respectively). These suggest that training based on awareness of body signals may be more effective than being rewarded for voiding at prescheduled times unrelated to &quot;having to go&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Several studies have reviewed the success rates of training protocols for achieving continence in children with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Almost all of these are based on the original rapid toilet training (RTT) method described by Azrin and Foxx. Many of these methods focus on abbreviating the original RTT protocol while also reducing the complexity and professional training involvement needed for success. These studies are limited by their small sample sizes and lack of generalizability, as well as protocols that would be difficult for parents to carry out without significant training and assistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Child-oriented training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1962, Dr. T Berry Brazelton introduced the child-oriented approach to toilet training. This approach suggests beginning toilet training only after certain physiologic and behavioral criteria of readiness are met. It stresses the importance of permitting the child the freedom to master each step at his or her own pace with minimal conflict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/1,2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Readiness'</a> below.)</p><p>Brazelton's method is associated with high rates of continence, fairly rapid training time, and low long-term regression rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Toilet-training recommendations are based upon Brazelton's child-oriented approach.

Pediatric health care providers must be able to recognize and understand the importance of readiness for both parent and child (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parental readiness'</a> below). They should discuss toilet training with parents at each health supervision visit beginning at age 12 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72501 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Child readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child's readiness for toilet training is based upon the attainment of certain physiologic, developmental, and behavioral milestones, rather than his or her chronologic age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A 2012 literature review identified 21 different toilet training readiness signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It remains unclear how many of the readiness signs need to be present before starting toilet training and whether or not any of these signs are more important than others. Some experts suggest beginning toilet training three months after the readiness criteria have been met to ensure success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. Delays in toilet-training mastery can occur if the child is not toilet trained while he or she is ready and interested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The age of readiness varied between 22 and 30 months in one longitudinal survey of the acquisition of toilet-training skills in a cohort of 267 Milwaukee-area children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Initiation of toilet training before 27 months of age is not associated with earlier completion of toilet training, suggesting little benefit to beginning training before this age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Physiologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child must have control over his or her sphincter muscle before he or she can be toilet trained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 1</a>). Local conditioning of reflex sphincter control can be elicited at 9 to 12 months of age. Voluntary coordination of sphincter control is accomplished by 12 to 15 months of age.

The clinician can ask the child to perform several simple tasks, such as pointing to body parts, sitting, standing, walking, and imitating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinician also should assess the child's bowel habits, history of constipation, ability to adapt to new situations, attention span, and distractibility. Constipation should be addressed and resolved before the initiation of toilet training. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Constipation and withholding behavior cycles'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronically ill child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toilet training is a crucial milestone for the chronically ill child; in this setting, the attainment of regular developmental milestones maintains an important sense of normalcy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, toilet training should not be delayed because of parental protectiveness for the child or lack of priority within the framework of the child's illness. All cognitively ready children who have no physical or anatomic conditions that would interfere with the toilet training process should begin training at the same age as that of their healthy peers. In addition to the readiness criteria described above, particular attention should be paid to medication effects, developmental delay, anomalies in organ systems involved in the toileting process, periods of bed rest, and consequences of the illness that could hamper the process. A systematic review concluded that toilet-training programs for children with Hirschsprung disease or anal atresia are enhanced by a multidisciplinary team approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Children with chronic illnesses may require additional time to complete the toilet-training process. Setbacks should be expected and treated with consideration and patience. Children with special health care needs may need to be observed more closely for patterns and cues that signal the child is ready to eliminate. Additional changes that may be necessary include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carrying a child who cannot walk or crawl to the potty chair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping a child who cannot use his or her hands to remove clothing and wipe after a bowel movement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Parental readiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents must be prepared for the toilet-training process before they begin.

Many parents mistakenly equate toilet-training success with intelligence or character, thus believing that toilet-training difficulty means their child is lazy, stubborn, hostile, lacking intellectual ability, or defiant of parental authority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinician should ask the parents about their motivation to begin toilet training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Toilet training should be delayed if the parents are motivated by the anticipated birth of another child, move to a new home, mother's returning to work, or specific day care requirements. Too many changes in a child's life make toilet training more difficult and increase the chance for initial failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>].</p><p>Parents should postpone the training process until they can allow it to be driven by the child's motivation, interest, and acquisition of skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. Parents should plan toilet training when at least one caregiver is able to devote the time and emotional energy necessary to be consistent on a daily basis for a minimum of three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Parents must understand that accidents are inevitable and that punishment has no role during the toilet-training process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Toilet training can set the stage for child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Parents who are easily frustrated, impatient, or not supportive of their children during office visits should be advised to wait until their child is at least 30 months old to begin toilet training. They should be counseled against using methods of toilet training that involve negative reinforcement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FOR TOILET TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toilet training involves many steps: communicating the need to go, undressing, eliminating, wiping, dressing, flushing, and hand washing. Going through these steps consistently reinforces proper toileting skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Using Dr. T Berry Brazelton's approach, the parent follows the child's cues for moving from one step to the next:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deciding on a vocabulary for bodily fluids that will be used consistently</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buying a potty chair &ndash; The potty chair is easier to use than is the over-the-toilet seat and provides the appropriate leverage for elimination. The child should be encouraged to take ownership of the chair by helping to pick it out, decorating it, or placing his or her name on it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accessibility of the potty chair &ndash; The chair should be placed in a convenient location, such as the child's playroom. In multilevel homes, it is advisable to have a potty chair on each level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becoming comfortable with the process &ndash; The child should be encouraged to sit on the chair fully dressed and look at books or play with toys. Beginning when the parents or siblings are using the toilet encourages imitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making the connection &ndash; After a week of sitting on the potty fully clothed, the child should be encouraged to sit on the chair naked. Parents can then begin to make the connection between elimination and the potty chair by placing the soiled diaper or stool in the potty and explaining to the child that this is the purpose of the chair. Once this connection is made, demonstration of disposal of the feces or the urine into the &quot;adult&quot; toilet can be undertaken.

Toilet training in the day care setting has advantages and disadvantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Day care providers are in a unique position to recognize the signs of readiness and participate in the toilet-training process.

This desire to learn and imitate can enhance and expedite mastery of toilet-training skills.</p><p>On the other hand, children who are toilet-training may receive inadequate supervision and assistance if the day care center is understaffed. In addition, children may become confused if parents and day care staff use different methods to teach toileting skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toilet-training/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for toilet training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toilet training is a challenging process that is frequently accompanied by problems and setbacks. Temporary setbacks are a normal part of the process and do not constitute failure; they are expected in times of acute illness, a family move, new child care arrangements, or a family crisis. Nocturnal enuresis and toileting refusal are the most common problems in healthy children.
