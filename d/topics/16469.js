Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown in numerous large clinical trials to reduce mortality from SCD in selected populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p>ICD systems consist of a pulse generator, typically placed in the pectoral region, and one or more leads which attach the pulse generator to the heart, most commonly to the endocardium via transvenous insertion (in rare circumstances epicardial leads can be used, but these require a thoracotomy and are typically only used if transvenous lead placement is no longer an option). However, conventional transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) systems come with the inherent drawbacks of transvenous leads, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks at the time of insertion &ndash; Cardiac perforation, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, hemothorax, pneumothorax (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Peri-procedural complications&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed risks over the lifetime of the device &ndash; Intravascular lead infection, lead failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Long-term complications&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Reports of complications at the time of TV-ICD range from 3 to 6 percent of implants. In addition, the delayed risks of transvenous leads include a risk of infection (incidence of 9 per 1000 device-years) and lead failure (ranging from 5 to 40 percent of leads at five years depending on the type of lead), both of which lead to repeat procedures and increased morbidity for patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices#H7878123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections involving cardiac implantable electronic devices&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Despite many well-documented benefits for appropriate patients, TV-ICDs possess a number of drawbacks, which are most notably related to the reliance on endovascular leads. The subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) has been developed in an attempt to minimize some of the limitations of TV-ICD systems by avoiding endovascular access entirely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97569\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97569 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97372 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The S-ICD system, including its indications, efficacy, complications, and our approach to choosing the proper candidates for the S-ICD, will be discussed in detail here. TV-ICD systems, including their potential complications, are discussed separately.

Analysis of data from the NCDR ICD registry showed that adoption of the S-ICD progressed rapidly, with a ninefold increase in the number of S-ICDs implanted (from 0.2 to 1.9 percent of all ICD implants) over the initial 2.5 years of availability in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>As with a standard transvenous ICD (TV-ICD), the S-ICD is comprised of a pulse generator and a shocking lead (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97569\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97569 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104722 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97372 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulse generator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104722 \">picture 1</a>) is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the left lateral, mid-axillary thoracic position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subcutaneous lead, which toward its terminal end contains an 8-cm shocking coil electrode, is tunneled from the pulse generator to a position along the left parasternal margin.</p><p/><p>There are proximal and distal sensing electrodes within the lead that flank the 8-cm shocking coil. The distal electrode sits just below the sternal notch, and the proximal electrode lies just above the xiphoid process. The cardiac rhythm is detected via a wide bipole between the two sensing electrodes or between one of the sensing electrodes and the pulse generator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>S-ICDs can deliver a maximum shock of 80 Joules; however, in defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing a successful conversion with 65 Joules is considered to provide an adequate safety margin. The device delivers an 80-Joule shock for defibrillation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias including monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), polymorphic VT, and ventricular fibrillation (VF). If VT or VF persists following the initial shock, the device will reverse polarity between the electrodes and deliver subsequent shocks. The S-ICD will deliver a maximum of five shocks for a single episode of a ventricular arrhythmia. If more than 3.5 seconds of asystole occurs following a shock, the S-ICD can deliver 30 seconds of demand pacing at a rate of 50 beats per minute. During an event, the S-ICD will store the electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing for subsequent review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The S-ICD can be implanted without the use of fluoroscopy by using anatomic landmarks to guide proper positioning. The mean procedure time for implantation of an S-ICD among first-time operators is 67&plusmn;33 minutes in one study, and 55&plusmn;23 minutes among operators who have inserted at least three S-ICDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is comparable to the procedure length for TV-ICD at a similar time in their development, but may be longer than contemporary TV-ICD implant times for experienced operators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The results from a small, nonrandomized observational series of patients suggest that DFT testing may not be required for all patients receiving the S-ICD, although additional data are required to reproduce and validate this result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-overview-of-indications-components-and-functions#H3613523668\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Overview of indications, components, and functions&quot;, section on 'Defibrillation threshold testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2350889595\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND AN APPROACH TO SELECTING THE S-ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (S-ICDs) were designed to address the limitations of conventional transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) systems, such as the need for vascular access. However, because of its unique capabilities and associated limitations, the S-ICD is not the best option for all patients requiring an ICD.</p><p>The number of patients who might potentially benefit from the S-ICD rather than a standard transvenous ICD is not known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104723 \">picture 2</a>). In a retrospective single-center cohort study of 1345 patients who underwent ICD implantation for both primary and secondary indications, 463 patients (34 percent) received antitachycardia pacing as a therapy or developed an indication for ventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy which cannot be performed using the S-ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, at five years of follow-up, 55 percent of the cohort would have been eligible for the S-ICD. On the other hand, when patients are properly selected, very few require revision of their device to allow for anti-tachycardia pacing or bradycardia pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H963847728\"><span class=\"h2\">When to consider the S-ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of November 2017, there are no formal guidelines for the selection of an S-ICD system. However, S-ICDs may be considered in younger patients due to the expected longevity of the implanted leads and a desire to avoid chronic transvenous leads. Therefore, an S-ICD system might be an appropriate consideration in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital cardiomyopathies, or inherited channelopathies. S-ICDs have been implanted in patients with a coexisting transvenous permanent pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. S-ICDs may also be considered in patients at high risk for bacteremia, such as patients on hemodialysis or with chronic indwelling endovascular catheters. Finally, patients with challenging vascular access or prior complications with TV-ICDs may be considered for S-ICDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>The S-ICD may also be an appealing option in children and teenagers who require an ICD, though data in this population are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2350889608\"><span class=\"h2\">When to avoid the S-ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from transient post-shock demand pacing, S-ICDs provide neither antitachycardia pacing as a therapy for ventricular arrhythmias nor continuous bradycardia pacing in the event of symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. Because of this, S-ICDs should not be implanted in patients who have ventricular tachycardia (VT) that is known or anticipated to be responsive to antitachycardia pacing or patients with the need for bradycardia pacing. Also related to the inability to provide chronic pacemaker activity, S-ICDs are also not indicated in patients requiring biventricular pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The S-ICD can be expected to function normally within the presence of a permanent pacemaker functioning in a bipolar pacing mode, with one study reporting successful implantation and functioning of an S-ICD in three patients with a pre-existing single-chamber right ventricular pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Unipolar pacing from a coexisting device is contraindicated.</p><p>A preimplantation surface electrocardiogram (ECG) screening tool has also been developed to minimize the number of patients at risk for inappropriate shock due to T-wave oversensing errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/9,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19,20</a>]. The tool identifies patients who have large and or late T-waves relative to the QRS using three vectors that mimic the device sensing vectors. Studies suggest that between 8 and 15 percent of patients are ineligible for an S-ICD due to susceptibility to T-wave oversensing and thus high risk of inappropriate shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987665563\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to S-ICD device selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are no defined guidelines for the selection of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) over a transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) system, our experts generally considered several clinical factors in deciding between the S-ICD and TV-ICD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97368\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97368 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have an indication for antitachycardia pacing or known to respond to antitachycardia pacing?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have an indication for standard transvenous pacing?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient a candidate for biventricular pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient relatively young with anticipated prolonged ICD therapy or multiple ICD systems in the course of one&rsquo;s lifetime?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have other indwelling venous catheters or leads?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient at high risk for systemic infection?</p><p/><p>While there are no strict guidelines on the utilization of the S-ICD in place of a TV-ICD, the answers to the above questions can provide guidance to the clinician when discussing the situation with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H963847734\"><span class=\"h1\">S-ICD EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonrandomized studies have evaluated the feasibility of an entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) system, which was approved for use in the United States by the FDA in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21-25</a>]. Successful detection of ventricular arrhythmias ranges from 98 to 100 percent, and conversion of induced arrhythmias during defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing ranges from 95 to 100 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97342\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97342 \">table 1</a>), with a mean time to therapy as low as 14 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/9,10,21-24,26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,21-24,26-32</a>].

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced at the time of implantation was successfully converted in 98 percent of patients with a permanent S-ICD. Adverse events included two pocket infections and four lead revisions.

Both primary endpoints were achieved, with a primary safety endpoint (180-day device and procedure-related complication free rate) of 92 percent and a primary efficacy endpoint (conversion of induced VF at the time of implantation) of 100 percent among patients who completed the DFT testing protocol. Even when a sensitivity analysis was performed that assumed that all 17 of the 321 patients who did not complete DFT testing at the time of implantation would have failed defibrillation testing, the predetermined primary efficacy endpoint was still met.

Additionally, the solid core design of the S-ICD lead and its lack of exposure to the repeated mechanical stresses of myocardial contraction may serve to improve lead durability when compared with transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the S-ICD system does have its own potential complications, including inappropriate shocks, pocket infection, and lead dislodgement or migration.</p><p>In the international S-ICD registry (EFFORTLESS S-ICD Registry), the rate of complications requiring reintervention within 360 days is implantation was approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].<strong> </strong>Among various publications on the S-ICD, the complication rate requiring reintervention has ranged from 1.3 to 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/9,10,21-24,26-29,31,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,21-24,26-29,31,34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate shocks &ndash; Inappropriate shocks remain as one of the most common and concerning complications seen with S-ICDs, with most studies reporting an incidence ranging from 4 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10,22-24,26-31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22-24,26-31,36</a>]. In a 2017 systematic review of 5380 patients from 16 studies, the pooled rate of inappropriate shocks was 4.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Overall, the most common cause for inappropriate shocks from S-ICDs is oversensing of T-waves, which differs from TV-ICD systems, in which most of the inappropriate shocks are due to supraventricular arrhythmias or lead malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/27,31,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,37,38</a>]. Inappropriate sensing of myopotentials from chest muscle activity may also be a source of inappropriate shocks. Inappropriate shocks are more likely to occur in younger, physically active patients, who are also those commonly selected for placement of an S-ICD system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The programming of an arrhythmia discrimination zone can reduce the frequency of inappropriate S-ICD shocks due to supraventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/26,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,39</a>].

In another study which compared 226 patients with dual-zone programming and 88 patients with single-zone programming, the two-year rates of freedom from inappropriate shock were 89.7 and 73.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pocket infections &ndash; While generally less concerning than infection involving TV-ICD systems, in which the indwelling venous leads pose a higher risk of systemic infection, pocket infections remain a concern with the S-ICD.

Unlike the recommended course of therapy for an infected TV-ICD, S-ICD infections can be treated conservatively with a course of antibiotics and without removal of the S-ICD. Because the S-ICD device does not contain any endovascular leads, the risk of infection causing <span class=\"nowrap\">bacteremia/endocarditis</span> is reduced, and in the event an S-ICD does require extraction, this procedure has less associated risk than transvenous lead extraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead movement &ndash; Lead dislodgement or migration had been noted to occur in 3 to 11 percent of patients in various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/abstract/10,22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22,29</a>].

The subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) has been developed in an attempt to minimize some of the limitations of TV-ICD systems by avoiding endovascular access entirely. (See <a href=\"#H963847716\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The S-ICD is comprised of a pulse generator and single shocking coil running along the left parasternal margin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97569\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97569 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104722 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97372 \">image 1</a>). These are both implanted subcutaneously without endovascular access. Implantation may be performed using anatomic landmarks, without the use of fluoroscopy. (See <a href=\"#H963847722\" class=\"local\">'S-ICD components and capabilities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate patient selection for the S-ICD is continuing to evolve. However, S-ICDs may be considered in certain subsets of patients (see <a href=\"#H2350889595\" class=\"local\">'Indications, contraindications, and an approach to selecting the S-ICD'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Younger patients due to the expected longevity of the implanted leads and a desire to avoid chronic transvenous leads</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients at high risk for bacteremia, such as patients on hemodialysis or with chronic indwelling endovascular catheters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with challenging vascular access or prior TV-ICD complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S-ICDs do not have the capability of providing continuous pacing; therefore, S-ICDs should not be utilized for patients requiring pacing, antitachycardia pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2350889608\" class=\"local\">'When to avoid the S-ICD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S-ICDs have proven to be very efficacious, with proper arrhythmia detection rates in &gt;99 percent of patients and successful spontaneous arrhythmia conversion rates of 88 percent on first shock (100 percent with a maximum of five shocks), both of which are comparable to rates seen with traditional TV-ICDs. (See <a href=\"#H963847734\" class=\"local\">'S-ICD efficacy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The S-ICD system does have its own potential complications, including inappropriate shocks, pocket infection, and lead dislodgement or migration. Inappropriate shocks appear to be the most common and concerning complication, but their frequency may be minimized by appropriate patient screening prior to implantation and appropriate device programming following implantation. (See <a href=\"#H2350889608\" class=\"local\">'When to avoid the S-ICD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H963847740\" class=\"local\">'Potential complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there are no defined guidelines for the selection of a S-ICD over a TV-ICD system, our approach in deciding between the S-ICD and TV-ICD is based on several clinical variables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97368\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97368 \">algorithm 1</a>).
