Children with known or suspected FBA may require rigid or flexible bronchoscopy, or rarely thoracotomy, for removal of foreign bodies.</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management of bronchoscopy for FBA in children. Epidemiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of FBA in children are discussed separately, as well as anesthesia for bronchoscopy in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-bronchoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult bronchoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1860925230\"><span class=\"h1\">PREANESTHESIA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual preanesthesia evaluation should be performed whenever possible, including a history and anesthesia-directed physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H689032269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Inhaled foreign bodies may cause pneumonia, atelectasis, hyperinflation distal to the obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchospasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68288 \">algorithm 1</a>), which may affect anesthetic management. Most children will come to the operating room after evaluation that has determined the location of the foreign body, timing of aspiration, and type of foreign body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105656\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105656 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>These issues, as well as the plan for rigid or flexible bronchoscopy, the mode of ventilation during maintenance of anesthesia, and the need for neuromuscular blockade, should be discussed with the surgeon in order to plan the anesthetic. For any surgery, and particularly for procedures in which the airway is used by both the surgical and anesthesia teams, excellent, closed-loop communication and in-depth pre-planning for both anesthesia and surgery are warranted to maximize patient safety.</p><p>Children in respiratory distress, or with suspected laryngeal or tracheal foreign body aspiration (FBA) should be taken urgently to the operating room for bronchoscopy. For other children, the timing of the bronchoscopy should be discussed with the surgeon. For children who are stable and at low risk of progression of airway obstruction, the procedure may be scheduled during optimal operating room staffing conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and after routine preoperative fasting (ie, six hours for solid foods, two hours for clear liquids) to minimize the risk of aspiration on induction of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H1428987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Pediatric patients'</a>.)</p><p>Full stomach concerns should not delay procedures for children thought to be at risk of progression of airway obstruction. Aspiration of stomach contents has not been reported in large series of children with FBA, whereas there are multiple reports of progression from partial to complete airway obstruction, from movement or swelling of the foreign body, or swelling of the tracheobronchial mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. For patients with full stomachs, a large bore gastric tube can be placed and suctioned after induction of anesthesia to reduce the volume of stomach contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2064061358\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATING ROOM TEAM PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the usual preparation for anesthesia, the bronchoscopist should be present in the operating room, with the equipment necessary for emergency airway rescue, prior to induction of anesthesia. All operating room nursing and technician staff should be part of the pre-procedure planning process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3936992516\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA FOR RIGID BRONCHOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia is required for children who undergo rigid bronchoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80653612\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication for children with foreign body aspiration (FBA) should be administered as it would be for other children who undergo anesthesia. We routinely premedicate pediatric patients with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> to facilitate parental separation and transfer into the operating room suite for the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H1944494325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Patient and parent preparation for anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3039380523\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic physiologic monitoring modalities used for adults during anesthesia are used for children as well, with appropriately sized equipment.

The use of positive pressure ventilation may theoretically move a foreign body in the tracheobronchial tree and convert a partial obstruction to a complete obstruction. Avoidance of positive pressure ventilation is less important if the foreign body is located distally in the bronchus. </p><p>We routinely perform an inhalation induction with 100 percent oxygen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> and maintain spontaneous ventilation during induction. After induction, the bronchoscopist sprays the vocal cords and trachea with 1 or 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a>, often only 2 to 3 mL total volume, limited by weight-based maximum doses (ie, 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> without epinephrine, 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> with epinephrine). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1879665833\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients require deep general anesthesia to tolerate rigid bronchoscopy. The decisions to employ an intravenous versus an inhaled technique, to administer neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), and to use intermittent positive pressure ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, or jet ventilation should be discussed with the bronchoscopist. The optimal choice of anesthetic agents and mode of ventilation are debated among pediatric anesthesiologists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3043000663\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of anesthetic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation anesthesia, intravenous anesthesia, or a combination of the two can be used for bronchoscopy for foreign body retrieval. The author routinely uses a combination of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> (either as a continuous infusion or administered as boluses as needed) for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. We avoid NMBAs unless required urgently. </p><p>Considerations when choosing anesthetic agents for rigid bronchoscopy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining an adequate depth of anesthesia may be difficult with inhaled anesthetics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, or halothane) because of intermittent interruption of ventilation and leak around the bronchoscope. Inhalation anesthesia during rigid bronchoscopy also pollutes the operating room with anesthetic gases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) allows for a continuous level of anesthesia regardless of the ventilation, but can also more easily abolish spontaneous ventilation. TIVA is usually administered with NMBAs and controlled ventilation. In one study, TIVA administered with spontaneous ventilation (without NMBAs) was associated with increased movement, breath holding, and laryngospasm, compared with inhalation anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H3535751065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of inhalation anesthesia with intravenous agents helps achieve a more stable, adequate depth of anesthesia than inhalation agents alone, while allowing spontaneous ventilation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90670307\"><span class=\"h3\">Mode of ventilation during rigid bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous ventilation during the maintenance of anesthesia minimizes the chance that an unstable foreign body will be moved more distally. In addition, the ability to ventilate with positive pressure around an airway obstruction is not guaranteed. However, positive pressure ventilation via the ventilating port of the bronchoscope is often required during rigid bronchoscopy, either because of hypoventilation at the required depth of anesthesia or because NMBAs are administered. In one small study of children who underwent rigid bronchoscopy for FBA, all 17 children who were randomly assigned to spontaneous ventilation with halothane during maintenance of anesthesia required conversion to assisted ventilation because of oxygen desaturation or inadequate depth of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Negative pressure ventilation can theoretically allow for better oxygenation and ventilation for some obstructive lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, the plan for ventilation should be discussed preoperatively with the bronchoscopist, recognizing that the plan may have to change during the procedure. In practice, the choice between spontaneous and controlled ventilation is often one of personal preference, and does not usually affect the outcome of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3971377407\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergence from anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the foreign body and the bronchoscope are removed, airway secretions should be suctioned while the child is still deeply anesthetized to minimize the chance of laryngospasm. The technique for emergence is driven largely by the state of pulmonary gas exchange and the amount of airway edema. For uncomplicated procedures without airway edema, we prefer to allow the child to emerge without an airway device in place, with oxygen administered by face mask. Patients with airway edema, persistent oxygen desaturation, or residual neuromuscular blockade may require endotracheal intubation and delayed emergence or recovery in the intensive care unit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1537534669\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who undergo uncomplicated removal soon after aspiration of a foreign body are discharged from the hospital within four hours of bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients who require lengthy bronchoscopy or develop complications, including airway trauma, pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, or who require postoperative oxygen supplementation may require admission to the hospital <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intensive care unit for further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-an-inhaled-foreign-body/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699124688\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children in respiratory distress or with suspected laryngeal or tracheal foreign body aspiration (FBA) should be taken urgently to the operating room for bronchoscopy.
