It has a molecular weight of about 62 kilodaltons (kD) and consists of two chains connected by a disulfide bridge.</p><p>Protein C circulates as a zymogen and exerts its anticoagulant function after activation to activated protein C (aPC), a serine protease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This process occurs when thrombin is bound to thrombomodulin, a specific receptor on vascular endothelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110320 \">figure 1</a>). Synthesis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) in protein C requires vitamin K. The Gla domain binds calcium, leading to a structural change that facilitates phospholipid binding, which is important for protein C function. The combined effects of protein C deficiency and vitamin K antagonism may explain the occurrence of warfarin-induced skin necrosis in some individuals with protein C deficiency who are treated with a vitamin K antagonist. (See <a href=\"#H470565701\" class=\"local\">'Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (management and prevention)'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary role of aPC is to inactivate coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, which are necessary for efficient thrombin generation and factor X activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The inhibitory effect of aPC is enhanced by protein S, another vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein. Inherited deficiency of protein C can lead to familial thrombophilia (increased tendency toward thrombosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Control mechanisms and termination of clotting'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to its anticoagulant function in the coagulation pathway, aPC has another set of roles in counteracting inflammation. In reactions mediated by the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), aPC acts directly on cells to exert multiple cytoprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory activities and protection of endothelial barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Levels of protein C take some time to reach the normal adult level after birth. Preterm infants may have protein C levels of approximately 7 to 18 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Full term newborns have protein C levels of approximately 20 to 40 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Neonates with significant thrombosis can have extremely low levels (low enough to suggest homozygous deficiency) that normalize upon recovery from the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Protein C levels increase during normal aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of inherited protein C deficiency is autosomal dominant; most patients with inherited protein C deficiency are heterozygous for a genetic defect. Over 160 different mutations and other genetic abnormalities have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The gene for protein C is located on chromosome 2 (2q13-14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Inherited protein C deficiency can be subdivided according to whether the deficient activity is due to reduced protein levels (type I) or to reduced protein function (type II). Type I deficiency is more common than type II deficiency; there do not appear to be clinical differences between type I and type II protein C deficiencies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type I</strong> &ndash; Type I deficiency (reduced protein C levels) is most commonly caused by a missense or nonsense mutation (encoding an alternate amino acid or a premature stop codon, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/11,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15</a>]. Other types of mutations have also been described, including promoter mutations, splice site abnormalities, in-frame deletions, frameshift deletions, in-frame insertions, and frameshift insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These defects can reduce the production of protein C or accelerate its destruction. The plasma protein C level is approximately 50 percent of normal, as measured in immunologic and functional assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Despite the similar protein C activity level in most patients with type I deficiency, there is marked phenotypic variability among patients. Similar mutations have been found among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, implying that the nature of the protein C gene defect alone does not explain the phenotypic variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type II</strong> &ndash; Type II deficiency (reduced protein C function with normal protein levels) is caused by mutations that affect the amino acid sequence of protein C and in turn inhibit the ability of protein C to carry out its anticoagulant function. A variety of different point mutations affecting protein function have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>].</p><p/><p>Although less common than the heterozygous state, some individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for a mutation or other genetic defect affecting protein C, typically due to inheritance of an abnormal allele from both parents. Severe deficiency can lead to neonatal purpura fulminans at birth. This was demonstrated in a 2017 series of 22 individuals who were homozygous or compound heterozygous for a protein C mutation, in which 16 (73 percent) presented with neonatal purpura fulminans, intracranial thromboembolism, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Six others with a higher plasma protein C level (approximately 30 percent) developed thrombosis after age 15. Other individuals can have mutations leading to protein C levels under 20 percent of normal; they are at risk for more severe phenotypes than heterozygotes. These mutants are collated in a <a href=\"http://www.itb.cnr.it/procmd/&amp;token=aShgHRmb7v4jAElgry0Tu2l0kHOzmIoZvampjQyFZbm5Md8LL+nLTUYwlY/uqy/R&amp;TOPIC_ID=1354\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">protein C mutation database</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>The coinheritance of protein C deficiency and another thrombophilic defect such as the factor V Leiden mutation is also occasionally seen and increases thromboembolic risk, although high quality evidence is lacking regarding the magnitude of the combined effect. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Venous thromboembolism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2448339446\"><span class=\"h2\">Control of protein C levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein C circulates in human plasma at an average concentration of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. The distribution of protein C levels in healthy adults is normally distributed, with 95 percent of the values ranging from 70 to 140 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is no significant gender dependence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1011500281\"><span class=\"h3\">Causes of reduced protein C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the role of protein C gene mutations, circulating levels of protein C may be reduced in a number of conditions that affect protein C synthesis (typically, acute insults to the liver such as right heart failure with hepatic congestion, severe liver disease, or disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>]. Protein C levels are also generally lower than normal in the setting of acute inflammation, which may explain reduced levels in certain infections or other inflammatory states such as acute infections, <span class=\"nowrap\">trauma/surgery,</span> or acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is little evidence that acute thrombosis by itself lowers protein C levels. As noted above, neonates have lower-than-normal levels of protein C, and protein C levels increase modestly during normal aging. (See <a href=\"#H1436028973\" class=\"local\">'Biology of protein C'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DIC</strong> &ndash; Patients with DIC have ongoing consumption of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with severe liver disease have reduced circulating levels of all of the natural anticoagulants produced in the liver, including protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, these changes are counterbalanced by corresponding changes in procoagulant factors, leading to a state of &quot;rebalanced&quot; hemostasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Protein C levels are not generally affected by infection. However, a particularly severe form of acquired protein C deficiency has been described in certain patients with acute viral, bacterial, and other infections (eg, malaria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Meningococcemia is probably the best characterized of these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In these cases administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protein C concentrate</a> may be helpful, similar to the management of neonatal purpura fulminans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uremia</strong> &ndash; Most uremic patients have low levels of protein C anticoagulant activity despite normal levels of protein C amidolytic activity and protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This is thought to be attributable to a dialyzable substance in uremic plasma that interferes with most clotting assays for protein C activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cancer or cancer therapy</strong> &ndash; A syndrome of venous limb ischemia with gangrene has been described in 10 patients with cancer who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The affected individuals had evidence of reduced coagulation factor VII and protein C activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some cancer chemotherapeutics such as asparaginase cause reductions in protein C levels. Hormonal agents have also been reported to alter protein C levels, although studies are less consistent in the effects observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced thrombosis in patients with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin K antagonists</strong> &ndash; Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) interfere with protein C production and maturation, as well as protein S. This has implications for diagnostic testing and patient management:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Diagnostic testing</strong> &ndash; Testing for protein C deficiency generally should not be performed if the patient is receiving a VKA anticoagulant, regardless of the type of assay. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Timing/effects of anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; The reduction of protein C levels by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> produces a transient procoagulant state, since protein C has a shorter half-life than the other vitamin K-dependent factors (except for factor VII) and thus is depleted more rapidly. This is of little to no clinical consequence in the vast majority of patients. However, it is responsible for the finding of warfarin skin necrosis in individuals with baseline low protein C levels in the setting of hereditary protein C deficiency, and it provides the rationale for administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protein C concentrate</a> to these individuals if they are treated with a vitamin K antagonist. (See <a href=\"#H3108290065\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to reduced protein C antigen levels with vitamin K antagonists, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct factor Xa inhibitors, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> do not affect circulating protein C levels. However, as noted below, these anticoagulations may interfere with clotting-based assays for protein C activity. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Timing/effects of anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin K deficiency</strong> &ndash; Patients with vitamin K deficiency have a defect that resembles the use of a VKA anticoagulant. Common causes of deficiency include severe malnutrition and antibiotic use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoantibodies</strong> &ndash; A case of an acquired inhibitor of protein C has been reported in an Australian patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This individual had a bleeding diathesis for several years and developed purpura fulminans before his death. Autopsy revealed arterial and venous thrombi in many organs. The IgG fraction of the patient's plasma completely inhibited the functional anticoagulant activity of activated protein C.</p><p/><p>Although these conditions can transiently reduce protein C levels, the reduction is typically modest, and these patients generally should not be considered to have protein C deficiency for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes (ie, we do not consider them to be in the same category as individuals with inherited protein C deficiency, and the reductions in protein C caused by an acute event generally do not require therapy with protein C replacement). An exception is a patient with severe clinical manifestations such as purpura fulminans and DIC in acute meningococcemia; in such cases administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protein C concentrate</a> may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the reduced levels of protein C seen in acute inflammatory states, administration of <strong>activated</strong> protein C was shown to be ineffective for the treatment of sepsis, as discussed separately.

In most cases levels are approximately 50 percent of normal (or less). However, the absolute threshold for deficiency is not clear. In a series of 28 individuals identified as members of a protein C-deficient family for whom pedigree analysis established that they personally inherited the familial defect, the range of protein C values was wide (median activity level 53 percent, range 19 to 82 percent; median antigen level 54 percent, range 22 to 89 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Most laboratories set the threshold for deficiency below approximately 65 percent of normal values obtained using a given test and laboratory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>It is also important to note that protein C levels can be transiently reduced in certain settings, as listed above (see <a href=\"#H1011500281\" class=\"local\">'Causes of reduced protein C'</a> above).

However, there is little evidence that acute thrombosis itself is associated with low protein C levels. Individuals with a protein C level below 55 percent of normal are very likely to have a genetic abnormality, while levels from 55 to 65 percent are consistent with either a deficiency state or the lower end of the normal distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-c-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Measures to improve the usefulness and accuracy of laboratory testing include the following:</p><p>As noted above, activity levels may fluctuate somewhat over time in the same individual. Those with severe deficiency will continue to show severe deficiency over time, but those with borderline values in the high 50 to low 60 percent range may occasionally cross the threshold into the normal range.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Inherited thrombophilia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired VTE risk factors</strong> &ndash; A number of acquired risk factors for VTE have been described, including immobility, surgery, trauma, cancer or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), certain drugs, the antiphospholipid syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hormonal changes including hormonal contraceptives, pregnancy, and the postpartum period. Like protein C deficiency, these patients may have VTE in typical or atypical locations. Unlike protein C deficiency, these acquired risk factors are often obvious from other features of the patient history and physical examination, and the family history typically does not reveal thrombophilia in these acquired disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Acquired risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of skin necrosis</strong> &ndash; Skin necrosis (or a similar-appearing finding) can occur in the setting of a number of vascular lesions including cryoglobulinemia, vasculitis, septic or cholesterol emboli, levamisole-contaminated cocaine, and calciphylaxis; or with other anticoagulants such as heparin. Like protein C deficiency, these other disorders may occur in a hospitalized patient who may be receiving an anticoagulant and may be associated with dramatic and life-threatening infarction in the skin and internal organs. Unlike patients with protein C deficiency, individuals with other forms of skin necrosis often have other findings of vasculitis or other clinical or skin biopsy findings of inflammation, organ damage, or infection. Unlike patients with protein C deficiency, individuals with HIT can have thrombocytopenia and usually have a clear temporal relationship with heparin exposure, and individuals with calciphylaxis typically have end-stage renal disease and bilateral skin findings in the upper extremities.

Management is similar to other individuals with a thromboembolism, with the possible exception of measures to reduce the risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

We are more likely to use a DOAC for individuals with typical venous thromboembolism (VTE) presentations, and we are more likely to use warfarin for individuals with concerns about adherence or those who would benefit from maintaining an international normalized ratio (INR) in the high end of the therapeutic range (eg, submassive or massive pulmonary embolism [PE] with severe clinical presentations such as <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxemia/shock,</span> or deep vein thrombosis [DVT] with proximal clot burden).</p><p>The duration of anticoagulation is individualized according to the age of the patient, site and clinical significance of the thromboembolism, and whether the thromboembolism was provoked or unprovoked. Indefinite anticoagulation is recommended for many patients with an unprovoked thromboembolic event, regardless of whether an inherited thrombophilia is identified; the documentation of protein C deficiency may strengthen the case for indefinite anticoagulation particularly if there is a strong family history of VTE.

Most patients with inherited protein C deficiency are heterozygous for a genetic defect that reduces protein C levels, activity, or both (ie, transmission is autosomal dominant). A number of acquired conditions also can reduce protein C levels, including acute thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants, meningococcal infection, and others.
