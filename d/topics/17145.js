(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=friedreich-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Friedreich ataxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One system proposed by Anita Harding divided these disorders into autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia types I, II, and III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I syndromes are ataxias with ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy, dementia and extrapyramidal features (ie, SCA1-SCA4, SCA8, SCA10, SCA12-SCA23, SCA25, SCA27, SCA28, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy or DRPLA)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II ataxias are associated with pigmented maculopathy with or without ophthalmoplegia or extrapyramidal features (ie, SCA7)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III syndromes are pure ataxic syndromes (ie, SCA5, SCA6, SCA11, SCA26, SCA29, SCA30, and SCA31)</p><p/><p>In the past, attempts were made to link the Harding classification system with the genetic forms of the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), but this is becoming unnecessary. We now favor a purely genetic classification based upon the genetic loci of the SCA. These loci have been numbered according to their order of identification: SCA1 through SCA40 (and the number continues to grow). Except for its historical interest, we tend to avoid the Harding classification since it is not particularly helpful in terms of narrowing the diagnosis.</p><p>In addition to the SCAs, there are a few other genetic disorders that are inherited in a dominant manner and often present as ataxia. These are discussed in this review to complete the differential diagnosis of these chronic, progressive ataxic syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Disorders that resemble SCA'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of other hereditary ataxias have been identified and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hereditary ataxias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF SCA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 30 types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) have been identified. Cerebellar ataxia is a feature of each type; other distinguishing features may suggest a particular type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, only 60 to 75 percent of patients with SCA have mutations in the known loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, among patients with apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia (ie, no family history), an SCA mutation (types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, or 12), most often SCA6, or Friedreich ataxia, can be identified in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Online resources such as the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9Nxrhgw4Exmojjr8Ey/I7GU&amp;TOPIC_ID=6230\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man</a> database can be used to keep up with advances in this area.</p><p>Several types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17) are associated with expansion of CAG repeats in the region that encodes for polyglutamine tracts in the protein products, similar to that seen in Huntington disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Wild-type chromosomes with a stable CAG repeat have 6 to 34 repeat units; more than 36 repeats results in an unstable, expanded, disease-causing allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Expansion of CAG repeats is thought to produce a toxic &quot;gain of function&quot; (ie, disease develops because the mutant form of the protein gains a new function, not because the protein loses its normal function). The disorders associated with expansion of CAG repeats share several clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They typically present in middle age, with progressive ataxia, neuronal dysfunction and eventual neuronal loss during the ensuing 10 to 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greater the number of CAG repeats on expanded alleles, the earlier the age of onset and more severe the disease. Thus, juvenile onset disease typically is associated with very large expansions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As examples of the variability in onset, a prospective study reported the mean age of onset for several common types of SCAs as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SCA1, 37 years (range 5 to 65)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SCA2, 35 years (range 7 to 66)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SCA3, 37 years (range 5 to 66)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SCA6, 55 years (range 31 to 77)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The repeats show both somatic and germline instability. As a result, successive generations of affected families experience anticipation, a phenomenon characterized by earlier onset and a progressively worse phenotype in subsequent generations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only a certain subset of neurons is vulnerable to dysfunction, even though the relevant protein is expressed widely throughout the brain and other tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar atrophy is the most common reported finding. Brainstem atrophy is variable, being more characteristic of SCA types 1, 2, and 7. Neurodegeneration of the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons has been reported for patients with SCA types 1, 2, and 3; this nucleus plays a role in the performance of horizontal smooth pursuit eye movements and in the accuracy of horizontal saccades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605308128\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the age of onset and rate of disability progression for the more common SCAs vary according to individual differences in the length of the causative CAG trinucleotide repeat. Most of the available data concern the most four most common types of SCAs, which are SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6. The following observations have been made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients require a wheelchair by 10 to 15 years after symptom onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier report of disease progression and survival for SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 found that SCA1 had a more rapid progression and shortest life expectancy, with death occurring at a median age of 56 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A later prospective study also found that progression was fastest in SCA1, followed by SCA2 and SCA3, in which progression was similar; progression was slowest for SCA6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Disability and mortality data for the other types of SCAs are limited. However, in most there is disability progression over one to two decades on average, and lifespan is shortened, though some are compatible with a normal lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No effective treatment is available for the SCAs, but small studies have investigated a variety of agents to treat ataxia. As examples, one report described transient improvement in cerebellar symptoms with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> 10 mg in four out of five family members with SCA type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and an eight-week placebo-controlled trial of 20 patients with SCA3 found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> led to improvement in some, but not all, measures of cerebellar dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These findings require confirmation in larger studies.</p><p>Animal studies suggest that polyglutamine neurotoxicity can be suppressed by overexpression of heat shock proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The technique of gene silencing with RNA interference has also shown promise in a mouse model of SCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The potential applicability of these findings to human disease remains speculative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF SCA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of SCA'</a> above), over 35 types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) have been identified. Cerebellar ataxia is a feature of each type; other distinguishing features may suggest a particular type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">SCA1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCA1 typically presents in the third to fourth decade of life, but tremendous variability in onset and clinical severity exists. It is characterized clinically by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and bulbar dysfunction. Other findings include hyperreflexia, increased tone, extensor plantar responses, and, in some patients, masking of these upper motor neuron findings by peripheral nervous system disease that results in wasting of the extremities and generalized fasciculations. In different populations, SCA1 accounts for 3 to 16 percent of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>Pathologically, SCA1 is characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, brainstem cranial nerve and inferior olivary nuclei, and the spinocerebellar tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>SCA1 is caused by a CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 6p22.3 in the coding region of the ATXN1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Expanded ATXN1 genes contain from 36 to 81 uninterrupted CAG repeats (normal alleles have 6 to 44 repeats; alleles with 36 to 44 CAG repeats are considered normal if they are interrupted by a few CAT units). Mutant ATXN1 aggregates into single nuclear inclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This aggregation reflects, at least in part, resistance of the mutant protein to degradation. The pathogenetic role of the nuclear inclusions themselves is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of SCA1 involves primarily a gain-of-function mechanism and, to a lesser degree, a partial loss-of-function mechanism for ATXN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition to the expanded polyglutamine tract, which is located towards the N-terminus of ATXN1, other important mediators include the AXH domain (amino acids 570 to 689), the nuclear localization sequence or NLS (amino acids 771-776), and the C-terminal amino acid of the NLS, Ser776. The AXH domain forms an oligonucleotide-binding fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and also interacts with a number of transcription factors and proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], including the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The NLS directs mutant ATXN1 to the nucleus, which is necessary for disease to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Phosphorylation of Ser776 is also necessary for toxicity of mutant ATXN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and is important for the interaction of ATXN1 with a protein called RBM17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>One model of ATXN1 toxicity postulates that wild-type ATXN1 exists in an equilibrium of two main protein complexes, one involving ATXN1 (not phosphorylated at Ser776) associated with CIC, and the other involving ATXN1 (phosphorylated at Ser776) associated with RBM17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, the expanded polyglutamine tract of mutant ATXN1 shifts the balance towards the <span class=\"nowrap\">ATXN1/RBM17</span> complex (toxic gain-of-function) and away from the <span class=\"nowrap\">ATXN1/CIC</span> complex (loss-of-function).</p><p>Interventions that lower ATXN1 levels could be useful for identifying therapeutic targets in SCA1. One approach is illustrated by a study that screened for kinase genes involved in the regulation of ATXN1 protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The investigators found that multiple components of the RAS&ndash;MAPK&ndash;MSK1 signalling cascade play a role in modulating ATXN1 protein levels in Drosophila and human cell lines. In addition, pharmacologic inhibitors of the pathway reduced ATXN1 levels. Further studies are needed to identify additional pathways that may be involved in ATXN1 regulation, and to determine whether manipulating these pathways is beneficial in SCA1. The same type of approach may be useful to look for therapeutic targets in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the toxic accumulation of mutant proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">SCA2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In different populations, SCA2 accounts for 6 to 18 percent of SCA kindreds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/16-19,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19,33</a>]. SCA2 is distinguished clinically from SCA1 by the presence of slow saccadic eye movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It results from expanded polyglutamine tracts in the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2) on chromosome 12q24, which encodes a protein called ataxin 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Ataxin 2 contains structural elements that appear to be important in RNA splicing. In contrast to the nuclear inclusions in SCA1, mutant ataxin 2 is associated with cytoplasmic microaggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Disease-causing alleles usually contain 35 to 64 CAG repeats (normal 14 to 31 repeats). An inverse relationship exists between disease onset and severity and the number of CAG repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When ATXN2 alleles contain more than 200 repeats, the disease can present as early as infancy with hypotonia, developmental delay, infantile spasms, autonomic dysfunction, dysphagia, and retinitis pigmentosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, disease onset in late adulthood, manifested as ataxia, slow saccades, and hyporeflexia, has been described in two patients with 33 CAG repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>An inverse relationship also exists between saccadic eye movement velocity and the number of CAG repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In one ethnic Chinese family, SCA2 has been associated with a predominant phenotype resembling dopa-responsive Parkinson disease or an ataxia-parkinsonism phenotype similar to progressive supranuclear palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, occasional patients with polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 have a phenotype of motor neuron disease similar to or indistinguishable from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic susceptibility in sporadic ALS'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic background influences the phenotype in geographically distinct families. For example, mental deterioration has been described in an Italian family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], and chorea and dystonia have been described in families from Tunis and Martinique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">SCA3 (Machado-Joseph disease)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is the most common of the autosomal dominant SCAs. It is present in 21 to 23 percent of kindreds in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/17,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,20</a>], 12 percent in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and as many as 48 percent in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">SCA3/MJD</span> gene is on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]; it encodes a protein called ataxin 3 or MJD1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The mutant gene has an increased number of CAG repeats (40 to more than 200 versus 12 to 41 (interrupted) in the wild-type allele). The wild-type protein predominantly is cytoplasmic, whereas mutant ataxin 3 is localized within the nucleus of neuronal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The mutant protein forms nuclear inclusions and is associated with cell degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">SCA3/MJD</span> can be associated with a variety of symptoms other than ataxia.

Oddly, it is this particular range of repeats that is pathogenic, as opposed to any expansion; some unaffected individuals bear hundreds of repeats.

The age of onset varies widely. The mean age of onset in Japan is 47 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>], while the typical age of onset as reported in Western literature is between 20 and 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Myoclonic epilepsy is common in juvenile (age &lt;20 years) onset. The prevalence of seizures decreases with increasing age beyond 20 years. With adult onset, cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis, and dementia are the predominant manifestations, making DRPLA difficult to differentiate from Huntington disease and other hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DRPLA is caused by CAG tract expansion of 49 to 88 repeats in the ATN1 gene on chromosome 12p.

In fragile X syndrome, methylation of DNA sequences in the promoter where the expanded CGG resides causes silencing of the FMR1 gene and complete loss of FMR1 protein. In FXTAS, fragile X RNA is produced but it is poorly translated into protein. This translational deficit is thought to cause a compensatory increase in the levels of FMR1 transcripts. Unfortunately, the RNA bearing the expansion now causes a toxic gain-of-function effect triggering downstream protein accumulation and neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant clinical features of FXTAS are a late-onset ataxia associated with postural tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-spinocerebellar-ataxias/abstract/174,184,185\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,184,185</a>].

Other distinguishing features may suggest a particular type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 \">table 1</a>). However, only 60 to 75 percent of patients with SCA have mutations in the known loci. Furthermore, among patients with apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia (ie, no family history), an SCA mutation (types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, or 12), most often SCA6, or Friedreich ataxia, can be identified in approximately 20 percent. Several types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17) are associated with expansion of CAG repeats in the region that encodes for polyglutamine tracts in the protein products. They typically present in middle age, with progressive ataxia, neuronal dysfunction and eventual neuronal loss during the ensuing 10 to 20 years.
