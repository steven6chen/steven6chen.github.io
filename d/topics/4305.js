A typical colonic diverticulum is a &quot;false&quot; or pulsion diverticulum, in which mucosa and submucosa herniate through the muscle layer, covered only by serosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69797\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69797 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Abnormal colonic motility is an important predisposing factor in the development diverticula. Patients with diverticulosis have exaggerated segmentation contractions in which segmental muscular contractions separate the lumen into chambers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91201\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91201 \">image 3</a>). It is hypothesized that the increase in intraluminal pressure predisposes to herniation of mucosa and submucosa. The neural basis for the abnormal motility observed in patients with diverticulosis remains unclear, although one report found that a central event appeared to be upregulation of smooth muscle M3 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>The development of diverticula specifically in the sigmoid colon can be explained by Laplace&rsquo;s law according to which pressure (P) is proportional to wall tension (T) and inversely proportional to bowel radius (R), where k is a conversion factor (P = kT &divide; R). Since the sigmoid colon is the segment of the colon with the smallest diameter, it is the site of the highest pressure during segmentation of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Additional structural changes may also decrease resistance of the wall to intraluminal pressure. As an example, most patients with sigmoid diverticula exhibit thickening of the circular muscle layer, shortening of the taeniae, and luminal narrowing. There is no hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the bowel wall, but increased elastin deposition is found in the taeniae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Structural changes in the wall may also be responsible for the appearance of diverticula at an early age in connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan's syndromes and in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Over time, the vasa recta is exposed to injury along its luminal aspect, leading to eccentric intimal thickening and thinning of the media.

It was previously believed that obstruction of diverticula (eg, by fecaliths) increased diverticular pressure and caused perforation. However, such obstruction is now thought to be rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80763\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80763 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69797\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69797 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The primary process is thought to be erosion of the diverticular wall by increased intraluminal pressure or inspissated food particles. Inflammation and focal necrosis ensue, resulting in perforation.

In one study, patients with SUDD displayed an increase in duration of rhythmic, low-frequency contractile activity particularly in segments of the colon with diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In another study, patients with diverticulosis were demonstrated to have a significantly reduced density of interstitial cells of Cajal as compared with controls, suggesting that abnormal colonic motility may be the underlying basis of symptoms in patients with SUDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>It has also been hypothesized that visceral hypersensitivity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SUDD. A study compared colonic visceral pain perception in response to luminal distention in patients with SUDD, asymptomatic diverticulosis, and healthy controls. In this study, patients with SUDD but not asymptomatic diverticulosis and healthy controls demonstrated a heightened pain perception both in the sigmoid colon with diverticula and in the unaffected rectum. The mechanism of hypersensitivity in patients with SUDD may relate to increased neuropeptides and alterations in enteric innervation following an episode of diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colonic-diverticulosis-and-diverticular-disease-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H637842045\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Diverticulosis merely describes the presence of diverticula. These may not be symptomatic or complicated. Diverticular disease is defined as clinically significant and symptomatic diverticulosis. Diverticular symptoms may be due to diverticular bleeding, symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease, diverticulitis, or segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis. (See <a href=\"#H360100637\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of diverticulosis increases with age from less than 20 percent at age 40 to 60 percent by age 60. In the Western hemisphere, diverticulosis is predominantly left-sided, with prevalence rates of 5 to 45 percent. In contrast, in Asia, the prevalence of diverticulosis is lower and diverticulosis is predominantly right-sided. Among patients with diverticulosis, bleeding occurs in approximately 5 to 15 percent, with the right colon being the source of colonic diverticular bleeding in 50 to 90 percent of patients. Approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients with diverticulosis develop diverticulitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary fiber is associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. A diet high in total fat and red meat is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic diverticular disease. There is no association between nut, corn, and popcorn consumption and the risk of diverticulosis and diverticular bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vigorous physical activity appears to reduce the risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. Obesity and several medications (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroids, and opiates) are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. Statins may be associated with a decreased risk of diverticular perforation. (See <a href=\"#H360101143\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diverticula occur at points of weakness in the bowel wall where blood vessels penetrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62942 \">figure 1</a>). The development of diverticula is probably multifactorial, involving both increases in intraluminal pressure caused by abnormalities in motility and histologic abnormalities in the bowel wall, which decrease tensile strength. (See <a href=\"#H360102335\" class=\"local\">'Diverticulosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental weakness of the artery in the diverticular wall predisposes to rupture into the lumen, resulting in a diverticular bleed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52254 \">picture 2</a>). In contrast, the underlying cause of diverticulitis is micro- or macroscopic perforation of the diverticulum itself. The inflammation is frequently mild, and a small perforation is walled off by pericolic fat and mesentery. This may lead to a localized abscess or, if adjacent organs are involved, a fistula or obstruction. Poor containment of the inflamed diverticulum or abscess results in free perforation and peritonitis. (See <a href=\"#H432685150\" class=\"local\">'Diverticular bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H360102341\" class=\"local\">'Diverticulitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in the gut microbiome, chronic inflammation, and visceral hypersensitivity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of segmental colitis associated with diverticula and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.
