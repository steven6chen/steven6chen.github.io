It is termed &quot;adult-onset Still's disease&quot; when it begins in patients over the age of 16 years. sJIA accounts for approximately 10 to 20 percent of all cases of JIA. It typically affects both sexes equally and may present in children as young as one year of age or younger. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Epidemiology and immunopathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sJIA are reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56224 \">table 1</a>). The management, complications, and prognosis of sJIA, as well as oligoarticular, polyarticular, enthesitis-related, and psoriatic JIA, and general topics on JIA are discussed separately.

Children with this illness comprise between 10 and 20 percent of all cases of JIA. However, data suggest that this illness is a unique condition closer to the autoinflammatory family of diseases, with distinct manifestations and treatment responses that distinguish it from the other diseases categorized as JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Most such children are initially thought to have an infection or malignancy, and the correct diagnosis is only suspected after there has been no response to antibiotic therapy and malignancy has been excluded.</p><p/><p>Some children who present with fever, rash, and diffuse joint pain do in fact have infections, leukemia, or other serious conditions that are not sJIA. Thus, it is essential that clinicians thoroughly exclude other conditions before making this diagnosis since there is no diagnostic test for sJIA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sJIA may present with a variety of articular and extra-articular signs and symptoms. In one large case series from a tertiary center, 136 patients were diagnosed with sJIA from 1990 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The following manifestations at disease onset and relative frequency were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 98 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis &ndash; 88 percent (8 percent with monoarthritis, 45 percent with oligoarthritis, and 47 percent with polyarthritis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash &ndash; 81 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphadenopathy &ndash; 31 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Articular manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthralgias are common early in the course of sJIA, but arthritis is not always prominent. Any number of joints may be involved when arthritis becomes apparent. Disease in the wrists, knees, and ankles is most typical, but the hands, hips, cervical spine, and temporomandibular joints are also sometimes affected. Unlike the oligoarticular and polyarticular subtypes of JIA, the arthritis of sJIA may begin in the hips and may progress very rapidly, causing severe damage and dysfunction and need for early joint replacement surgery, as well as loss of growth potential in younger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H401617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Growth retardation'</a>.)</p><p>Micrognathia and cervical spine fusion are commonly present in children with longstanding sJIA, but do not appear until after the disease has been present for months to years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70981\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70981 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the past, these abnormalities affected as many as 50 percent of children with disease onset in the first decade of life. Earlier and more targeted treatment has led to a decrease in these complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Extra-articular manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common extra-articular manifestations are quotidian fever and a macular, salmon-pink rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with sJIA usually come to medical attention urgently because they typically present with high fevers. The key finding that suggests the diagnosis is the daily but intermittent nature of the fever. The diagnosis is strongly in doubt if the patient's temperature does not spontaneously return to normal on a daily basis. This pattern of one high spike of fever a day with normal or subnormal temperatures during the rest of the 24-hour period is called &quot;quotidian fever.&quot; Some children have more than one spike of fever a day, but their temperature returns to normal in between the fever spikes. Affected children are characteristically ill appearing when febrile but seem to improve dramatically when their temperature is normal. If rash is present (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rash'</a> below), it also tends to appear or worsen when the fever is present. These features, in addition to the lack of response to antibiotics, help to distinguish patients with sJIA from those with an infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Some children do not have this typical fever pattern initially and have continuous fevers, fever that does not occur daily, or no fever at all. If untreated, however, most patients will eventually develop this highly specific fever pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A macular, salmon-pink rash is frequently present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62959\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62959 \">picture 1</a>). It usually consists of multiple round to oval macules that are slightly raised and are of differing sizes. The smaller ones have a slight pallor surrounding them, and the larger ones commonly exhibit central pallor. The rash is often difficult to detect or may not be noticed at all in dark-skinned individuals. The rash is brought out by heat and touch and is often found in the axillae and around the waist but may be present anywhere on the body. It is most prominent when the child is febrile. Unlike viral exanthems, which persist, the rash often fades as the temperature returns to normal, only to reappear with the next fever spike. The rash also may appear following stroking of the skin or other minor trauma (Koebner phenomenon) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96207 \">picture 2</a>). The rash can be intensely pruritic in some patients. It can become somewhat confluent and become urticarial in appearance, especially in those patients who scratch themselves because of the pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition, the following clinical features can be observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are commonly found. This combination frequently raises suspicion of a malignancy, but lymph node biopsy shows benign reactive hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis and other forms of serositis are a feature of sJIA. A small pericardial effusion that is not usually clinically significant is often noted on echocardiogram. Large pericardial effusions are rare. Pericarditis may result in tamponade, in some cases with a fatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary manifestations include pleural effusion, which most often present during the acute phase of the illness in patients with serositis. Interstitial lung disease, alveolar proteinosis, and pulmonary hypertension are rare but are being reported with increased frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some children may initially present with features suggestive of Kawasaki disease (KD) or atypical KD, including coronary artery dilation on echocardiogram in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. These patients are only diagnosed with sJIA when they fail to respond to treatment for KD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease#H2509270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation of typical versus incomplete KD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100154015\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic patterns of laboratory abnormalities frequently are present and suggestive of the disease, although there are no laboratory findings that are specific for the diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cell (WBC) counts in the 20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> range are not uncommon, and, at times, they may exceed 60,000 to 80,000. Granulocytes predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is usually a marked reactive thrombocytosis, and the platelet count may exceed <span class=\"nowrap\">1,000,000/mm<sup>3</span> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, thrombocytopenia or even low normal platelet counts (eg, less than <span class=\"nowrap\">200,000/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> should prompt careful evaluation for an alternative diagnosis (eg, bone marrow aspiration to exclude leukemia). A sudden, rapid drop in the platelet count may herald the development of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H40787333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia is commonly present and often profound. It is primarily due to decreased synthesis and poor absorption of oral iron rather than increased destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The anemia can be exacerbated by chronic gastrointestinal blood loss induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Thus, children with sJIA commonly become iron deficient over time, but oral iron supplementation is often ineffective until the underlying inflammatory process has been corrected. Intravenous or intramuscular iron may be required in cases of severe iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Oral iron supplementation is often necessary once systemic disease begins to come under control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is typically elevated in children with active sJIA and may exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span>. A normal ESR is rare when the disease is active. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP), another acute-phase reactant, is usually elevated as well. The combination of a sudden fall in the ESR and in the platelet count to &quot;normal&quot; levels may herald the onset of MAS in an unwell child rather than clinical improvement. Careful evaluation of children with this combination of findings is essential. A dramatic rise in the serum ferritin level or in fibrin split products (D-dimers) also strongly suggests the onset of MAS. A <span class=\"nowrap\">ferritin/ESR</span> ratio of &gt;80 has been proposed as a biomarker of MAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H40787333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme hyperferritinemia (often greater than 1000 or even 50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> is also common in children with active sJIA, even if overt MAS is not present. It can be useful in raising suspicion for the diagnosis of sJIA since very few other illnesses are associated with such extreme elevations in ferritin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>].

However, markedly elevated hepatic enzyme abnormalities, prolonged clotting times, or an increase in D-dimers should prompt immediate consideration of diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) or MAS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H40787333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urinalysis is typically normal in children with sJIA. Some children manifest low-grade proteinuria when febrile, but significant proteinuria or hematuria are almost never seen in patients with sJIA. Secondary amyloidosis resulting in proteinuria that can reach the nephrotic range has been reported in the European literature but is exceedingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, the presence of hematuria or significant proteinuria in combination with fever, arthritis, and rash should prompt consideration of another diagnosis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or a systemic vasculitis rather than JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-management-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Management overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) rarely are seen in sJIA. Their presence should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. A positive RF, for example, may be associated with RF-positive polyarticular JIA, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, or the early onset of adult-type rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in teenagers. Both RF and ANA may be present in children with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). However, these conditions rarely mimic sJIA.

The fever must be present for at least <strong>two weeks</strong> and the arthritis for at least <strong>six weeks </strong>in order to make a definitive diagnosis according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria since many viral and other postinfectious forms of arthritis are associated with fever, as are malignancies. However, these diseases often lack the characteristic intermittent spiking fever pattern of sJIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There may be a prolonged delay between the onset of fever and the development of arthritis, but a definitive diagnosis of sJIA cannot be made until arthritis is present and is shown to be persistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the presence of a characteristic fever pattern, rash, and arthritis, a tentative diagnosis of sJIA can be made and appropriate therapy begun before two weeks have elapsed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

A similar and probably identical illness has been described in adults and is called adult-onset Still's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recurrent disease after the age of 16 years is not adult-onset Still's disease, but simply a continuation of sJIA.

The white blood cell (WBC) and acute-phase reactants are also often highly elevated. There is almost always localization to one joint or limb in these disorders, although this can occur in sJIA as well. Children with bone or joint infections appear acutely unwell. In contrast to the joint involvement in JIA, in addition, these children often have severe pain in the joint, which is usually hot and red, with little mobility whatsoever in the case of septic arthritis, and exquisite bone point tenderness in the case of osteomyelitis, similar to that seen in malignancies (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> below).

Parvovirus B19 is one of the most commonly confused viral infections that cause arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The mistaken diagnosis of these self-limited conditions as sJIA is in large part responsible for the incorrect notion that the latter disorder often resolves completely without aggressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-viral-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of viral arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reactive arthritis may also follow a variety of bacterial infections. Those typically associated with fever, rash, and arthritis include neisserial and streptococcal infections. Subacute bacterial endocarditis may present with these symptoms and may be associated with a positive test for rheumatoid factor (RF). These entities can usually be differentiated by their clinical picture, appropriate culture results, and response to antibiotics. Reactive arthritis following enteric infection may be also mistakenly diagnosed as sJIA. The key differential features pointing away from a diagnosis of sJIA include gastrointestinal complaints, ocular findings, and lack of the classic, salmon-pink rash. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Other autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthritis with fever and rash may be the presenting manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, and other autoinflammatory diseases. These illnesses can be excluded by the clinical picture and appropriate laboratory evaluations. As an example, abdominal pain is common in polyarteritis nodosa and should prompt consideration of this illness once other causes have been excluded. Chronic abdominal pain in a child with suspected sJIA should not be ascribed to benign conditions, such as &quot;mesenteric adenitis,&quot; without a thorough investigation to exclude other possible diagnoses, especially vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Clinician awareness is the key to proper diagnosis. sJIA is not associated with thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, neutropenia, or bone pain. Children with sJIA are uncomfortable and may have swollen and painful joints, but they rarely cry out from pain even when their joints are manipulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By comparison, children with leukemia or other malignancies may be exquisitely uncomfortable, have trouble simply bearing weight because of pain, and often have severe pain when the shaft of a long bone, in locations away from the joints (eg, mid-humerus or mid-femur), is carefully palpated and compressed. These findings are rare in JIA. The pain and joint swelling associated with leukemia can also change and be fleeting, as opposed to the pain of chronic arthritis, which may involve several joints, but usually does not move from place to place. Refusal to weight bear is an important sign (red flag) of bone pain that may be indicative of a malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria may have a diurnal fever pattern identical to that of sJIA and is also associated with chills, joint pains, and evidence of systemic illness. Malaria is extremely rare in nonendemic countries, but appropriate thick blood smears to exclude this diagnosis should be performed if the patient gives a history of residence in or travel to such areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marrow infiltrative diseases, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and inherited conditions, such as Gaucher disease and Hunter and Hurler syndromes, also may present with fever, joint pain, and rash. However, none of these illnesses manifest the typical laboratory findings, the fever pattern, or the salmon-pink rash of sJIA.

However, sJIA is probably an autoinflammatory disorder rather than an autoimmune disorder like other categories of JIA. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H100153589\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>sJIA can be difficult to diagnose because there are no specific diagnostic tests, and arthritis, which is necessary for definite diagnosis, is often not evident early in the course of the disease. In addition, infection and malignancies must be considered prior to the diagnosis of sJIA in these cases because patients can initially appear quite ill with high, spiking fever; rash; and often have hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy and elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts prior to the presentation of arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H100153589\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H100154015\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made clinically and is based upon the presence of intermittent, daily, high, spiking fevers (in a quotidian fever pattern) for at least two weeks and arthritis. A salmon-pink rash is also suggestive of the diagnosis, particularly when other clinical features are present. There are no laboratory findings that are specific for the diagnosis of sJIA, but granulocyte predominant leukocytosis, elevated acute-phase reactants including thrombocytosis, and hyperferritinemia should raise suspicion for this disorder in association with the other typical clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H100154015\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes arthritis associated with infections, other autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, malignancy, and malaria.
