Then he is not able to father a child. (If only 1 testicle is removed, a man might still be able to father a child.) Also, surgery near the testicles and penis sometimes damages nearby nerves. Nerve damage can make it hard for men to ejaculate. If ejaculation doesn't happen, sperm can't exit the penis. But in some cases, doctors can remove sperm from the testicles to help a couple get pregnant.</p><p/><p>Both chemotherapy and radiation can damage the testicles. As a result, the testicles make no sperm, too little sperm, or unhealthy sperm. This is a problem because a man needs to have a normal number of healthy sperm to get a woman pregnant.</p><p>Not everyone who gets chemotherapy or radiation will have fertility problems. With chemotherapy, it depends on the medicine and dose a person gets. With radiation, it depends on the dose and part of the body treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197558113\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I want to father a child someday?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should let your doctor know <strong>before</strong> you start your cancer treatment. In some cases, treatment that has a lower chance of affecting future fertility might be available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197558128\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other ways to preserve fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The main things that can be done to help men preserve their fertility are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sperm banking &ndash; This involves collecting and freezing your sperm <strong>before</strong> you start cancer treatment. To collect your sperm, you will need to ejaculate. If you can't ejaculate, or if there is no sperm in your semen, your doctor can do a procedure to remove sperm from your testicle. After the sperm is collected, it is frozen and stored until needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shielding your testicles during radiation treatment &ndash; This involves wearing a special shield on the outside of your body during radiation treatment. The shield covers and protects your testicles, so they aren't damaged by the radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197558143\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which option is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to preserve your fertility depends on your cancer, treatment, age, and individual situation. Talk with your doctor about your choices. To make your decision, you might want to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits and downsides of the choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your doctor thinks they will work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much they cost &ndash; For example, it costs money to collect, freeze, and store sperm. Health insurance sometimes pays for these things.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197558160\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I still can't father a child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you still can't father a child after cancer treatment, you have other options. You and your partner can try to have a baby using another man's sperm from a sperm bank. In addition, adoption might be an option.</p><p>Couples can have a tough time making these decisions. You might find it helpful to talk to a counselor or go to a support group for people who are facing the same issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197558175\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Testicular cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Testicular cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
