The structures in the neck include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bones &ndash; The neck has 7 bones that are stacked on top of each other. These bones make up the top part of the spine and are called the &quot;cervical vertebrae.&quot; Neck pain can happen when the bones get worn down or develop abnormal growths (called &quot;spurs&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligaments &ndash; Ligaments are strong tissues that connect bones to other bones. Ligament damage can happen when the neck moves back and forth suddenly (called &quot;whiplash&quot;), such as in a car accident.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; Discs are cushions that sit between the bones. When the discs change shape or move out of position, people can have symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles &ndash; Muscles hold the head up and make the neck move. Neck pain can be caused by muscle strain or tension, such as from poor posture or stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerves &ndash; A large bundle of nerves (called &quot;the spinal cord&quot;) travels down the middle of the spine. Nerves branch off from the spinal cord to all parts of the body. People can have symptoms if their nerves are irritated or pushed on by nearby bones or discs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397290\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms can people with neck pain have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have different symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, stiffness, or tightness in the neck, shoulders, upper back, or arms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to move or turn the neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when turning or tilting the head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or strange feelings (such as pins and needles) in the shoulders or arms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or moving the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no control over the bladder or bowels</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397297\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see a doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A severe injury to your head or neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or weakness in your arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No control over your bladder or bowels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that doesn't get better after you treat it at home for 1 week</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397304\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to have tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need any tests. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam. He or she will feel your muscles and check how your head and neck move.</p><p>But some people might need tests. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle or nerve tests to see if the muscles and nerves work normally</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397311\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage the muscles that are tight or tense</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put ice on the area to reduce pain &ndash; You can rub ice on the area for 5 to 7 minutes. Or you can put a frozen bag of peas or a cold gel pack on the area for 20 minutes at a time, a few times a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat on the area to reduce pain and stiffness &ndash; Take a hot shower or hot bath, or put a hot towel on the area. Don't use heat for more than 20 minutes at a time. Don't use anything too hot that could burn your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do neck exercises &ndash; Different exercises can stretch the neck, shoulder, and back muscles and help make them stronger. Ask your doctor or nurse if you should do exercises and which ones can help your symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce stress &ndash; Stress can make pain worse and prevent symptoms from getting better. Try to reduce your stress. You can ask your doctor or nurse about exercises that can help you relax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch your posture &ndash; Try to keep your neck straight in line with your body and avoid activities that involve a lot of neck movement. When you sleep, keep your head and neck in line with your body. Try to avoid sleeping on your stomach with your head turned to one side.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397318\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatments might I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can use other treatments if your neck pain doesn't improve after you treat it at home. For example, he or she might suggest that you see an exercise expert, called a physical therapist. Or your doctor might suggest an injection of a numbing medicine into your neck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397325\"><span class=\"h1\">Can neck pain be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help prevent neck pain, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use good posture &ndash; Hold your head up and keep your shoulders down.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sitting in the same position for too long</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing work above your head for too long</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid putting weight or pressure on your upper back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your neck in line with the rest of your body when you sleep</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13397332\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whiplash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whiplash (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck fracture (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
