The overall survival rate after diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer exceeds 96 percent at 10 years. Following treatment for testicular cancer, oncologic follow-up is guided in part by the probability of relapse over time. Although most relapses occur within the first five years, late recurrences can occur. </p><p>During the period of oncologic follow-up, after active therapy or any time thereafter, patients with a history of testicular cancer may develop symptoms that affect quality of life or have abnormal findings on clinical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both primary care clinicians and oncologists may be challenged with questions related to whether or not these symptoms or findings are due to prior treatment. </p><p>Because of the young age at which men with testicular cancer are diagnosed and success in treatment of testicular cancer, issues of cancer survivorship evolve as men mature. This topic will cover late treatment-related complications in testicular cancer survivors. The discussion is intended for the management of patients who have completed the active phase of cancer therapy and have transitioned to receiving almost all of their care from their primary care clinician. Acute treatment-related toxicity and post-treatment follow-up of men treated for testicular cancer are discussed in more detail separately.

The vast majority of testicular cancers are germ cell tumors, which are classified as either seminomas or non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs). Approximately 90 percent are detected with low-stage disease (stage I to IIB) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110732 \">table 2</a>), and most (60 to 80 percent) will have clinical stage I disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876749810\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary treatment for testicular cancer is an inguinal orchiectomy. The information from pathology is used to determine pathologic tumor stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110731 \">table 1</a>). Following diagnosis, treatment is based on the likelihood of recurrence in order to tailor treatment and minimize the long-term side effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536925901\"><span class=\"h2\">Fertility preservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When testicular cancer is suspected in men of reproductive age, counseling regarding sperm banking as a means of fertility preservation is routinely performed prior to initiation of any form of treatment. However, less than 30 percent of men actually choose to bank sperm and an even smaller proportion (10 percent) actually use banked sperm to father a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

If administered to men with stage I seminoma, RT is directed to the paraaortic nodes to a dose of 20 Gy. For men with non-bulky stage II seminoma, 30 to 35 Gy RT to the paraaortic and ipsilateral iliac nodes may be used as an alternative to chemotherapy.

One-half of men with residual masses will have resolution of these findings during surveillance at a median of one year. However, the routine resection of larger residual masses (&ge;3 cm) is controversial. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be useful in detecting residual disease in this setting. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-stage-ii-seminoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of stage II seminoma&quot;, section on 'Posttherapy residual masses'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For men with residual retroperitoneal adenopathy that demonstrates fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on PET at the end of treatment, postchemotherapy RPLND is sometimes performed, although this surgery should be restricted to specialized centers where a large number of testicular cancer patients are seen. Following resection of residual masses that contain viable tumor, at least two further courses of chemotherapy are generally advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H632905713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to surgery following chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Role of adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>NSGCT </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Residual masses are commonly seen on postchemotherapy imaging studies in men with NSGCTs, and standard of care is to resect these lesions. Approximately 60 percent of patients with postchemotherapy residual masses will either have viable cancer or teratoma. As long as tumor markers have normalized, surgical resection is preferred over further chemotherapy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H900676917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance following orchiectomy for stage I testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Active surveillance protocols'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-follow-up-for-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment follow-up for men with testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Guidelines for follow-up'</a>.)</p><p>Factors that influence the nature and intensity of follow-up after completion of initial definitive therapy include the histology (seminoma versus nonseminomatous germ cell tumor [NSGCT]), original risk stratification group (for men presenting with advanced disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110732 \">table 2</a>)), and treatment (particularly the use of surgery or radiation therapy [RT] to treat the retroperitoneal lymph nodes).</p><p>The intensity of follow-up is guided in part by the probability of relapse over time. For men with seminoma, the median time to relapse is 13 to 16 months (range, 2 to 108 months), but up to one-third of relapses occur more than three years after completion of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. By contrast, over 95 percent of relapses of NSGCTs occur within the first two years following orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Although most relapses occur within the first five years for both seminoma and NSGCT, late recurrences can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Based upon this type of observation, follow-up is most intensive during the first year or two after treatment and then gradually decreases. There are no guidelines to inform the frequency of routine imaging or blood work for the long-term survivor of testicular cancer, particularly after the first five years have passed. However, most groups now recommend that follow-up continue for at least ten years following successful therapy because of the risk of late relapse. Therefore, cancer surveillance should be coordinated between the primary care provider and the oncology team.

The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for myocardial infarction and angina pectoris was 1.17 (95% CI 1.04-1.31).

(See <a href=\"#H7365582\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular cancer survivors are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, particularly among men who received chemotherapy or were treated with mediastinal radiation therapy (RT). (See <a href=\"#H773414440\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular cancer survivors are at an increased risk of long-term pulmonary toxicity, especially in those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and continue to use tobacco. (See <a href=\"#H773414634\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypogonadism can be seen as a long-term complication from treatment of testicular cancer, particularly among men treated with extended-field RT or cisplatin-based chemotherapy. It can result in infertility and issues related to sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H30007340\" class=\"local\">'Hypogonadism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy are at increased risk for both renal dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Renal function (with creatinine and magnesium levels) should be assessed annually in men who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H7365631\" class=\"local\">'Renal impairment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7365638\" class=\"local\">'Neurotoxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men treated for testicular cancer have at least a twofold increased risk of developing a second malignancy in their lifetime, especially if prior treatment consisted of both chemotherapy and RT. (See <a href=\"#H1538072322\" class=\"local\">'Secondary malignancies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular cancer survivors should undergo a complete physical examination annually, with weight and blood pressure recorded. Particular attention should be paid to cardiovascular or neurologic complaints. (See <a href=\"#H773415445\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up for long-term survivors of testicular cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oncologic follow-up within the first five years following diagnosis should be coordinated between the primary oncology team and the primary care provider to ensure that services are not duplicated. (See <a href=\"#H536926018\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up post-treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-follow-up-for-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment follow-up for men with testicular germ cell tumors&quot;, section on 'Guidelines for follow-up'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For long-term cancer survivors (ie, &gt;5 to 10 years post-diagnosis), a decision to discontinue cancer surveillance should be based upon patient preference and following a discussion between the primary care and oncology teams. (See <a href=\"#H773415445\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up for long-term survivors of testicular cancer'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-care-of-long-term-testicular-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gilligan T.
