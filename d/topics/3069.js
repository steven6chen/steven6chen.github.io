The vas deferens then transports sperm from the epididymis to the urethra, where they are diluted by secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate. Abnormalities at any of these sites, particularly the epididymis and vas deferens, can cause infertility. Finally, for successful natural conception, sperm must be ejaculated into the female partner's vagina. Disorders of sperm transport include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormalities of the epididymis</strong> &ndash; Absence, dysfunction, or obstruction of the epididymis leads to infertility even though testicular sperm production is normal. Intrauterine exposure to estrogens may cause epididymal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Little is known about functional abnormalities of the epididymis, but some drugs used in other countries (eg, triptolide) and chemical toxins (chlorhydrin) affect the function of metabolism of spermatozoa within the epididymis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. While poorly documented, it is presumed that some men with isolated asthenospermia (impaired motility) have defects of epididymal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormalities of the vas deferens</strong> &ndash; Male infertility can result from acquired or congenital abnormalities of the vas deferens. Bilateral obstruction, ligation, or altered peristalsis of the vas deferens results in infertility. Obstruction may result from infection (gonorrhea, chlamydia, tuberculosis), while ligation of the vas deferens (vasectomy) is an intentional, medically induced cause of infertility. It may be reversible by surgical re-anastomosis, but some men have an immune response to sperm granulomas that form on the proximal side of the ligation and remain infertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One to 2 percent of infertile men have bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens. Most have mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Many infertile men with mutations of <em>CFTR</em> present with infertility in the absence of many of the other findings (eg, respiratory and pancreatic disease).

The clinical presentations include recurrent sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, situs inversus, and male infertility (with asthenozoospermia or oligozoospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">143,144</a>]). Genetic mutations of dynein proteins or thioredoxin-nucleoside diphosphate kinase have been implicated to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/145,146\" class=\"abstract_t\">145,146</a>]. A similar genetic defect that may lead to abnormal transport of sperm is Young syndrome, in which inspissated secretions within the vas and epididymis interfere with transport of sperm, leading to obstructive azoospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ejaculatory duct disorders </strong>&ndash; Patients with ejaculatory duct obstruction present with a low ejaculate volume and seminal fructose with no sperm count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very low sperm motility. Ejaculatory duct obstruction is uncommon but can be treated surgically with minimally invasive techniques. Spinal cord disease or trauma, sympathectomy, or autonomic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus) can cause decreased or retrograde ejaculation and lead to decreased fertility. Some men with severe retrograde ejaculation (eg, due to neuropathy or medications) may also be infertile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seminal vesicles and prostate</strong> &ndash; It is not known if abnormal function of the seminal vesicles and prostate contributes to infertility, but chronic infection of the accessary glands might contribute to infertility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual dysfunction</strong> &ndash; Erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, and infrequency of vaginal intercourse (less than twice per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]) also may be contributing factors to male infertility.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h1\">IDIOPATHIC MALE INFERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic male infertility refers to men with repeatedly normal semen analyses who cannot achieve pregnancy with an apparently normal female partner, despite careful assessment of all possible causal mechanisms.

As an example, in one observational study of 3847 men with oligozoospermia (using previously published rather than current World Health Organization [WHO] criteria for normal semen parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>], defined as sperm concentration less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">million/mL</span> with concomitant defects in total motility [less than 50 percent]), 10 cases of testicular cancer were seen (8 of 10 with no history of cryptorchidism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. When compared with a control population, this represented approximately an 18-fold greater incidence of testicular cancer (standardized incidence ratio 18.3, 95% CI 18.0-18.8).</p><p>In a study in United States fertility centers, 34 cases of germ cell tumors were found in 22,562 male partners of the couples seeking infertility treatment, giving a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.8) compared with men without male infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-male-infertility/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. However, these studies are limited by the small number of cases. Based upon available data, we do not suggest routine screening for testicular cancer in men with infertility. However, we do suggest careful palpation of the testes on all routine exams.

These conditions can be subdivided into congenital, acquired, or systemic disorders.

Although multiple specific testicular disorders have been identified, the pathogenic basis for testicular dysfunction is often unknown.
