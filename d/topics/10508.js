In addition, myocardial ischemia or stunning may impair LV (or right ventricular [RV]) function.

Causes include incomplete myocardial preservation during CPB, particulate or air emboli in a coronary graft or a native coronary artery, coronary spasm, coronary thrombosis, technical surgical problems such as kinking of a graft or compromised graft anastomosis, or incomplete revascularization secondary to distal disease or inoperable vessels. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is employed to assess global LV function as well as regional wall motion abnormalities that may be associated with specific graft or vessel compromise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative complications among patients undergoing cardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Mechanical complications'</a>.)</p><p>After reversible surgical factors are investigated and addressed, interventions by the anesthesiologist should focus on optimizing HR, pacing mode, and vasoactive drug therapy. Usually, LV dysfunction will improve with inotropic drug therapy or combination therapy with positive inotropic and vasodilator agents to optimize cardiac index (CI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Initially, small boluses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> (5 to 10 mg) or diluted epinephrine (5 to 10 mcg) may be administered to treat ventricular dysfunction and hypotension; if necessary, a vasoactive infusion is initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>).

Selection of a first-line inotropic agent depends on the individual patient's hemodynamic abnormalities during the weaning process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93595 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>), as well as institutional preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/2,3,6,8-10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,8-10,12</a>]. Alternate inotropic agent(s) may be selected as conditions change during the postbypass period.

The velocity of LV fiber shortening is increased, resulting in increased CI. However, administration of milrinone may result in significantly reduced SVR, necessitating concomitant use of an arterial vasoconstrictor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine).</p><p>Levosimendan is an inodilator that increases myocardial sensitivity to calcium, which increases cardiac contractility and also opens adenosine triphosphate channels in vascular smooth muscle, which causes vasodilation.

While a prior meta-analysis of small trials suggested a benefit of levosimendan on survival and adverse events after cardiac surgery, data were limited by heterogeneity and risk of bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a subsequent randomized trial in 849 cardiac surgical patients, prophylactic levosimendan administration (with infusion initiated shortly before surgery and continued for 23 hours) did not result in a lower rate of death, perioperative myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy (RRT), or use of a ventricular assist device (VAD) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, a randomized trial in 335 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery showed no differences in a composite endpoint that included need for prolonged catecholamine infusion, use of a VAD, or RRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and another randomized trial in 506 patients was stopped early for futility, failing to show a benefit for levosimendan administered for up to 48 hours after cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4249362767\"><span class=\"h3\">Controversies regarding use of inotropic drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest not routinely administering inotropic drugs.

Some data suggest that perioperative use of inotropes is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/6,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20-22</a>]. As an example, in one observational study using propensity score matching, perioperative use of inotropes was independently associated with more than threefold increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.7, 95% CI 2.1-6.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Diastolic dysfunction may be caused by LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, infiltrative disease, myocardial edema, or pericardial constriction. Ischemia, hypoxia, or cellular calcium overload may also cause functional cellular abnormalities of myocyte relaxation that result in diastolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-mechanisms-of-diastolic-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Weaning from CPB may be challenging in patients with preexisting diastolic dysfunction, and the following considerations are applicable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Euvolemia should be maintained. Appropriate interpretation of ventricular filling pressures (eg, central venous pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP]) is important since patients with diastolic dysfunction may have abnormally increased filling pressures for any given LV or RV filling volume. As a result, transient and abrupt elevation in filling pressures should not be overtreated with excessive diuresis or preload reduction that may result in precipitous hypotension. However, excessive volume administration may precipitate pulmonary edema due to impaired LV compliance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative complications among patients undergoing cardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Inadequate preload'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal HR should be maintained with atrial or AV sequential pacing at 80 to 90 beats per minute. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV synchrony should be maintained, since the atrial contribution to ventricular filling may exceed 30 percent. Atrial pacing or AV sequential pacing may be needed to achieve this goal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047556847\"><span class=\"h2\">Right ventricular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RV dysfunction may complicate weaning from CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. RV dysfunction manifests as increased central venous pressure with systemic hypotension due to reduced functional LV preload. Direct visualization of the surgical field reveals a distended RV with poor contraction. TEE examination reveals severe RV hypokinesis often accompanied by significant tricuspid regurgitation. The interventricular septum may be shifted towards the left, thereby impairing filling of the LV and resulting in increased left-sided filling pressures (ie, PAWP) despite inadequate LV filling volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;</a>.)</p><p>RV dysfunction may be preexisting, or caused or exacerbated by pulmonary hypertension, RV ischemia or infarct, intracoronary or pulmonary air embolism, or tricuspid regurgitation. Intracardiac air, always present to some degree following open left-sided cardiac procedures, preferentially enters the right coronary artery due to its more anterior (non-dependent) position when a patient is supine.</p><p>Management includes ensuring that BP and coronary perfusion pressure are adequate, as well as preventing increased pulmonary vascular resistance, which can be caused by hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, hypothermia, or pain. Other therapies for RV dysfunction include providing inotropic support with agents that produce pulmonary arterial vasodilation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>). Excessive administration of fluid may worsen RV dysfunction. Severe RV dysfunction will result in systemic hypotension that may also compromise LV perfusion.</p><p>In refractory RV failure, continuous inhalation of an aerosolized vasodilator to treat pulmonary hypertension and reduce RV afterload is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The resultant systolic mitral leaflet-septal contact causes mechanical obstruction to LV ejection, as well as mitral regurgitation due to inadequate coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F102345\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef102345 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93358\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef93358 \">movie 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Such LVOT obstruction may be preexisting or may occur after mitral valve repair or aortic valve replacement.</p><p>LVOT obstruction is dynamic. Because a hypertrophied LV has reduced compliance and is extremely sensitive to changes in preload and afterload, hypovolemia or reduced SVR will worsen obstruction.

For example, systemic hypotension with low CO and mitral regurgitation is often treated with inotropic agents, but such treatment only worsens LVOT obstruction and further decreases BP. Also, TEE assessment of the mechanism causing LVOT obstruction may lead to a surgical decision to reinstitute CPB to revise a mitral valve repair or perform ventricular septal myectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093503226\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiogenic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock occurs in 0.2 to 6.0 percent of patients after cardiac surgery with CPB, with inability to maintain oxygenation, adequate CO, or end-organ perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

The balloon pump, positioned in the proximal descending aorta, augments myocardial perfusion by increasing coronary blood flow and diastolic BP during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. This is accomplished by inflation of the balloon during diastole, which displaces blood toward the aortic root and into the coronary arteries. During the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, rapid deflation of the balloon prior to aortic valve opening reduces LV afterload, myocardial oxygen consumption, and myocardial work. Timing for inflation and deflation of the IABP balloon is shown in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83420\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef83420 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83948 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Mechanical support with IABP counterpulsation is a mainstay for treatment of failure to wean from CPB, with between 14 and 28 percent of all IABP use occurring after CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42</a>]. Reduction in LV afterload and myocardial work during systole may provide the primary benefit of IABP therapy in this setting. In addition, the increase in diastolic pressure and reduction in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) improve coronary perfusion. Although IABP counterpulsation does not generate actual systemic blood flow, CO is typically improved by approximately 20 percent.

Before initiation of counterpulsation, TEE is employed to confirm proper positioning of the tip of the balloon in the descending aorta a few centimeters distal to the origin of the subclavian artery. If TEE is contraindicated or unavailable, positioning of an IABP may confirmed with a chest radiograph in the immediate postoperative period (the IABP tip should lie between the anterior portion of the second intercostal space and the first lumbar vertebra) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93400\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93400 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>After initiation of balloon assistance, expected changes in hemodynamic variables include increased CO and mean BP, with decreased systolic BP, increased (augmented) diastolic BP, reduced HR, and decreased mean PAWP.</p><p>Several studies have been performed assessing the effectiveness of an IABP during weaning from CPB, with in-hospital mortality ranging from 20 to 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/36,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39-42</a>].

Components of an ECMO circuit include the gas exchange unit <span class=\"nowrap\">(oxygenator/heater),</span> driving force (pump), and tubing. Similar to CPB, ECMO can support oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, heating, and cooling, but unlike CPB, ECMO lacks the ability to administer fluids directly via the circuit. Typically, ECMO is easier to establish than mechanical ventricular support with an Impella VAD (see <a href=\"#H3863611788\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular assist devices'</a> above), and allows higher flow rate (up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span>.

VA ECMO effectively removes carbon dioxide and supplies oxygen and supports both the right and left ventricles. Blood flow through the lungs is minimized with effective VA ECMO. Thus, VA ECMO may be utilized to treat left or right heart failure, and also supports oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal if respiratory failure is present. </p><p>Venovenous (VV) ECMO involves drainage of blood from the venous system to an oxygenator-ventilator (artificial lung), with return of the oxygenated blood to the right side of the heart where it passes through the lungs, left side of the heart, and eventually into the systemic circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56622 \">figure 6</a>). VV ECMO effectively removes carbon dioxide and provides oxygen, but relies on effective function of both the right and left sides of the heart. Thus, VV ECMO is used as a therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure (eg, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with protamine reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome), but adequate cardiac function. </p><p>Cannulation for ECMO may be either peripheral or central [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Central cannulation is often utilized for postcardiotomy shock since the heart and vessels are already surgically exposed, and existing cannulae may be transitioned from the bypass circuit to ECMO circuit very efficiently. Cannulae for venous drainage from the patient may be placed in the right atrium or in both the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava. Central return of blood to the patient may be via a graft or cannula in the aorta (VA ECMO) or the pulmonary artery (VV ECMO). Ideally, intraoperative TEE guidance is provided by the cardiac anesthesiologist during central cannulation for ECMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-problems-after-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In order to provide unobstructed flow, the ideal position of the venous drainage cannula is in the mid- to upper-right atrium away from the interatrial septum; correct placement is easily visualized on TEE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116234\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116234 \">image 3</a>). Although the position of the arterial return cannula in the ascending aorta often cannot be visualized with TEE, it is helpful to visualize the guidewire used to introduce the cannula in the descending aorta before final positioning. Central cannulation is often easier, allows larger cannula, eliminates risk of femoral venous or arterial complications including peripheral ischemia associated with a large cannula in the femoral artery. The major disadvantage is that central cannula are less secure and dislodgement may cause life-threatening hemorrhage.</p><p>Cannulae for peripheral venous drainage<strong> </strong>from the patient are generally placed in the femoral vein, with the tip of the catheter positioned at the superior cavoatrial junction using TEE guidance. Adequate venous drainage must be ensured to achieve adequate oxygenation. For VV ECMO, peripheral venous return of oxygenated and decarboxylated blood into the patient is also accomplished via a femoral vein, with the tip of the catheter located at the inferior cavoatrial junction. For VA ECMO, peripheral arterial return to the patient may be accomplished via a cannula in a femoral artery or via a graft placed on an axillary artery. The primary advantages to peripheral cannulation include ease of chest closure and removal of cannulae, as well as the fact that peripheral cannulae are generally more secure (less likely to dislodge) than central cannulae.</p><p>Initial settings for target a flow rate of 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/minute,</span> and eventually, flows of up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> can be delivered.

(See <a href=\"#H3061741351\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not routinely administering inotropic and vasopressor drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, vasoactive drugs may be necessary to treat low cardiac output syndrome or vasoplegia in the postbypass period. (See <a href=\"#H856462958\" class=\"local\">'Vasoactive drug therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4249362767\" class=\"local\">'Controversies regarding use of inotropic drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In selected patients with postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, temporary mechanical circulatory support (eg, intraaortic balloon pump [IABP] counterpulsation, percutaneous or implantable ventricular assist device (VAD), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) may be necessary. Device selection depends on individual patient hemodynamic factors, surgical preferences, and institutional resources. (See <a href=\"#H3093503226\" class=\"local\">'Cardiogenic shock'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary problems immediately after CPB include airway obstruction, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H549889546\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is common after CPB. Although we attempt to minimize or avoid transfusion, we typically administer red blood cells (RBCs) for hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Considerations in transfusion decisions include patient-related factors (eg, age, severity of illness, cardiac function, or risk for critical end-organ ischemia), the clinical setting (massive or active blood loss), laboratory parameters (eg, hematocrit, mixed venous oxygen saturation [SVO<sub>2</sub>]), or electrocardiographic (ECG) or transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) evidence of myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H1649013441\" class=\"local\">'Anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is appropriate for patients with bleeding due to factor-mediated coagulopathy (eg, severe dilution or consumption of coagulation factors). The efficacy of unactivated prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) versus plasma for factor-mediated coagulopathy and bleeding after CPB is under investigation. Cryoprecipitate is reserved for treating fibrinogen deficiency (&lt;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Transfusion of platelets is reserved for patients with platelet levels <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/mm<sup>3</span> </sup>and ongoing clinically significant microvascular bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H3351200773\" class=\"local\">'Coagulopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1623493594\" class=\"local\">'Thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic disturbances after CPB are common (eg, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia); these may cause hemodynamic compromise. (See <a href=\"#H3010010467\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest maintaining the blood glucose level at &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during CPB and the postbypass period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment is with intermittent doses of insulin if effective, or a continuous insulin drip if glucose levels are persistently elevated. We also recommend avoiding a more stringent target (eg, 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1196504902\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We employ measures to prevent and treat postbypass hypothermia including adequate rewarming prior to separation from CPB, increasing the room temperature, warming cold blood products and intravenous (IV) fluids, and use of patient warming devices that employ forced air or circulating fluid. (See <a href=\"#H1654633370\" class=\"local\">'Hypothermia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, attempted chest closure causes severe hypotension. Causes include compression of the right atrium and RV that impairs ventricular filling or compromise of the surgical repair (eg, kinking of a graft or trapping of a graft in the sternal wall). In such patients, delayed sternal closure can be performed on a subsequent postoperative day. (See <a href=\"#H116644631\" class=\"local\">'Inability to close the sternum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During transport to the intensive care unit (ICU), the ECG, pulse oximetry (SaO<sub>2</sub>), and intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) are continuously monitored.
