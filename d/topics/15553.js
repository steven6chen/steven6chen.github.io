This assessment, includes an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113973 \">table 3</a>) and helps to identify patients at higher than normal risk for sedation.

These patients are at increased risk for sedation-related adverse events and should be cared for by individuals who are specifically trained and experienced with high-risk pediatric procedural sedation. Ideally, they should be cared for by providers working in an organized sedation service that has ancillary personnel with sedation expertise and an ongoing quality improvement program.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Competency of the sedation provider</strong> &ndash; Health care providers who perform procedural sedation in children should have strong resuscitation and advanced pediatric life support skills, including advanced training in the assessment and management of the pediatric airway as well as specific training in pediatric procedural sedation.

In settings where pediatric procedural sedation is routine (eg, children's hospitals), a pediatric sedation service can provide efficient and effective sedation and is a systematic support for the safe performance of sedation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2253050\"><span class=\"h1\">SEDATION FOR IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging can often be performed <strong>without</strong> sedation in older cooperative children and young infants (up to six months of age) who are bundled and recently fed. Furthermore, as newer technologies decrease the image capture time for computed tomography (CT), many uncooperative patients can be imaged <strong>without</strong> sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, a significant number of older infants, toddlers, and older children with intellectual disability cannot cooperate even for brief imaging tests (eg, helical CT) and warrant sedation to ensure accurate imaging without excessive radiation exposure. Thus, imaging tests that are negatively impacted by motion (eg, noninterventional CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) constitute the most common nonpainful procedures for which children undergo sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ideally, the chosen agent or agents should have a quick onset of action that permits successful and safe completion of the imaging study, maintains airway reflexes, and has limited impact on breathing and hemodynamic stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The regimen should also permit rapid recovery with few side effects, such as nausea or agitation. Because imaging studies are not painful, analgesia is <strong>not</strong> necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2253057\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3100661883\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful imaging with helical CT is less sensitive to patient movement than MRI and, given the rapid speed of imaging, can frequently be done without sedation or requires only brief sedation (approximately 5 to 10 minutes). As an example, in one case series of 104 patients undergoing helical CT, only 9 percent received sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>When sedation is required, the clinician has a choice of several different agents as discussed below.</p><p>The intravenous (IV) route is preferred where maximal efficiency and throughput is desirable, such as patients undergoing urgent imaging for diagnostic purposes, because the onset of action is shorter and more predictable, titration is easier, and (depending upon the agent), recovery is quicker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83512 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, if inadequate sedation or serious adverse events occur, lack of IV access may impede further management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although lower efficacy was described for IV etomidate (76 percent of 17 patients) in one small trial, more than 99 percent of 446 children receiving etomidate for imaging successfully completed the procedure in a subsequent observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/8,9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,13</a>]. Based upon a review of prospectively collected registry data from over 22,000 children, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> is also frequently used for imaging; radiologic procedures accounted for almost 25 percent of reported use in the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although not specifically reported for radiologic procedures, 99.8 percent of all procedures were successfully completed which suggests that IV ketamine has similar efficacy for CT when compared with propofol, etomidate, or dexmedetomidine. However, when used as a single agent, ketamine may be associated with random movement in some patients.</p><p>IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">etomidate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> have a more rapid onset of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexmedetomidine</a> (1 to 2 minutes versus 8 to 16 minutes, respectively) and etomidate has a shorter duration of action than dexmedetomidine (approximately 15 minutes compared with 30 minutes, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Duration of action with ketamine and propofol varies by dose and mode of administration (bolus or continuous infusion) and compares favorably with etomidate.</p><p>Evidence is lacking to suggest that <strong>major</strong> adverse events (eg, laryngospasm, aspiration, apnea requiring airway intervention, or need for resuscitation) varies by the medication used to sedate for CT.
