The median duration of disease prior to the diagnosis of CRC was comparable for CD and UC (15 and 18 years, respectively). The median age at diagnosis of CRC was 55 years in CD and 43 years in UC.

Patients with extensive colitis, defined as disease extending proximal to the splenic flexure, have the greatest risk of CRC. (See <a href=\"#H1450742638\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For surveillance, we suggest chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies because this technique has shown the highest yield for dysplasia detection. Chromoendoscopy involves the topical application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> to enhance mucosal irregularities and facilitate targeted biopsies.

We obtain four biopsies every 10 cm from the cecum to the rectum. Additional biopsies should be taken in the sigmoid colon and rectum. Alternatively, six biopsies from the right colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid, proximal, and distal rectum can be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, areas of mucosal irregularity should be biopsied. (See <a href=\"#H1351380589\" class=\"local\">'High-definition white light colonoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with left-sided or extensive UC, or Crohn colitis involving more than one-third of the colon, we suggest examinations every one to three years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who have undergone a subtotal colectomy with an ileostomy and have a rectum left in place (ie, a Hartmann's pouch), we suggest surveillance of the remaining rectum every one to three years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with an ileal pouch anal anastomosis, we suggest pouchoscopy every three to five years in the absence of inflammation and atrophy.

If the follow-up examination reveals that polyp resection was incomplete and dysplasia or cancer is histologically confirmed, surgical consultation is obtained for further management.
