Thus, hormonal interventions that reduce androgen activity can be effective treatments. Postmenarchal women with moderate to severe acne are the primary candidates for hormonal therapy. Oral contraceptives and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> are commonly prescribed hormonal therapies.</p><p>Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris is discussed here. Nonhormonal acne therapy is reviewed separately.

Therefore, understanding the role of these hormones is important for grasping the rationale for hormonal therapy. In general, androgens have stimulatory effects on acne, whereas estrogens have inhibitory effects on acne.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1914685646\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens contribute to acne through the promotion of sebum production by sebaceous glands in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The increase in sebum production contributes to the accumulation of sebum and keratinous material in pilosebaceous follicles. This leads to partial obstruction of the follicle, resulting in the formation of comedones, the primary lesions of acne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80536%7EDERM%2F62816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80536 graphicRef62816 \">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Sebum also provides a growth medium for <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em>, a bacterium that resides in pilosebaceous follicles and contributes to the inflammatory response in acne vulgaris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70809 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The correlation between the normal rise in serum androgen levels and sebum production in the prepubertal period and the typical age of onset of acne (also the prepubertal period) supports an important role for androgens in acne. This importance of androgens is also supported by the occurrence of acne as a clinical feature of hyperandrogenism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-hyperandrogenism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal hyperandrogenism&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyperandrogenism'</a>.)</p><p>The major sources of circulating androgens are the adrenal glands and gonads; however, androgens are also produced in the sebaceous glands within the skin. Androgen production in the sebaceous glands occurs as a result of a series of enzymatic processes that convert dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an adrenal precursor hormone, to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68437 \">table 1</a>). DHT is a more potent androgen than testosterone, having 5 to 10 times more affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The type 1 5-alpha reductase isoenzyme converts testosterone to DHT in sebaceous glands.</p><p>Testosterone and DHT exert their effects by binding to androgen receptors on cell surfaces, which results in translocation of these hormones into cell nuclei, where they initiate transcription of androgen-responsive genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the skin, androgen receptors are found in the basal layer of sebaceous glands and on the keratinocytes in the outer root sheath of hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition to effects via action on sebaceous glands, androgens may also contribute to acne through the promotion of follicular hyperkeratinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The specific genes that contribute to the development of acne as a result of androgen receptor binding are unclear.</p><p>Although endogenous or exogenous factors that cause hyperandrogenism can induce or exacerbate acne, most patients with acne have serum androgen levels that are within normal limits. Increased sensitivity of sebaceous glands to androgens is a proposed mechanism for the development of acne in these patients. The presence of normal serum androgen levels in most women is supported by a small study of 18 women without endocrine disease that found that both women with acne and women without acne had serum androgen levels within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the authors also noted that women with acne had significantly higher serum androgen levels than women without acne despite having serum androgen levels within in the normal range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postadolescent-acne-in-women#H328490228\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postadolescent acne in women&quot;, section on 'Androgens'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postadolescent-acne-in-women#H328490221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postadolescent acne in women&quot;, section on 'Menstrual cycle'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with excessive levels of serum androgens secondary to disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal tumors, or androgen-secreting ovarian tumors are more likely to develop acne. In a study of 52 women (ages 18 to 35 years) with mild acne and their age-matched controls, polycystic ovary syndrome was significantly more common in the patients with acne than in the control group (27 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In general, women who present with acne and concomitant hirsutism or menstrual irregularity should have a gynecologic and hormonal evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80117 \">picture 3</a>).

However, the mechanism through which this occurs in not completely understood. Proposed mechanisms include estrogen-mediated opposition of androgens within the sebaceous gland, inhibition of gonadal androgen production through a negative feedback loop on gonadotrophin release, increases in sex-hormone binding globulin (which reduces the bioavailability of androgens), and effects on regulation of genes involved in sebaceous gland growth or lipid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The estrogen component in oral contraceptives is known to inhibit ovarian androgen production and increase production of sex hormone binding globulin (resulting in reduced serum-free androgen levels), and is hypothesized to have additional inhibitory effects on androgen action within the sebaceous gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most progestins in oral contraceptives have androgenic properties, although this is counteracted by the antiandrogenic effects of the estrogen component. Some progestins (eg, drospirenone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, chlormadinone acetate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dienogest-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dienogest</a>) have antiandrogenic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-therapy-for-women-with-acne-vulgaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In addition, as mentioned above, clinical experience suggests that women with normal serum androgen levels who present with acne involving the lower face and premenstrual acne flares may be more likely to respond to hormonal agents.

A reasonable alternative to spironolactone would be to proceed to therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Spironolactone'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-isotretinoin-therapy-for-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Spironolactone</a> can cause fetal harm and menstrual irregularity, and is usually given with an oral contraceptive.
