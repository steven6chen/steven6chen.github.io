Anemia is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of hospitalization and hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Screening for and treating anemia is a routine part of the care of hemodialysis patients. This topic provides an approach to screening and treating anemia among such patients. The treatment of iron deficiency among hemodialysis patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The screening and treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and in peritoneal dialysis patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3989564287\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nephrologists use the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to define anemia. Anemia is defined by WHO as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for adult males and postmenopausal women and an Hb &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Normal ranges for hemoglobin/HCT'</a>.)</p><p>However, the WHO definition of anemia does not define goals of treatment among hemodialysis patients. Even when typically treated, hemodialysis patients will still have anemia as defined above. This is because, among hemodialysis patients, the treatment of anemia typically involves erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to avoid severe anemia and reduce the need for blood transfusions but not to normalize Hb levels. Multiple studies have shown that, among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (including those on hemodialysis), using ESAs to correct Hb to normal increases the risk of adverse outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3994049381\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In discussions below, we use specific Hb targets to define indications for and goals of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1536076889\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H743843624\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be screened for anemia upon initiation of maintenance dialysis with a complete blood count (CBC), particularly if they have not been closely followed prior to initiation and do not have a recent CBC at the time dialysis is initiated.</p><p>Patients who are found to be anemic (hemoglobin [Hb] &lt;12 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> as defined above) should be evaluated for its cause. The initial evaluation of anemia is generally the same for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients as in the general population. The evaluation should include red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and testing for occult blood in stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99491 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Among hemodialysis patients, untreated anemia is usually severe (typically with hemoglobin [Hb] 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and, if left untreated, associated with increased mortality and disabling symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-the-older-adult#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Functional outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-the-older-adult#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Increased mortality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms of anemia'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of anemia includes erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous (IV) iron. The goal of treatment is to mitigate any symptoms due to anemia and to reduce the likelihood of needing a blood transfusion. The selection of the individual therapy depends on the severity of anemia and on the presence of iron deficiency. The indications for treatment are based upon US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-issued guidelines for ESA administration, although these are occasionally modified in selected individuals. Our approach is consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Threshold transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin levels for initiating treatment with iron are different in patients who either are anemic (Hb &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> OR are on an ESA versus those who have an Hb &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F111204\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111204 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2457672604\"><span class=\"h2\">Low hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than or equal to 30 percent and ferritin less than or equal to 500 ng/mL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Such patients should be treated with IV iron. Although they are unlikely to be iron deficient as defined by bone marrow biopsy, the administration of iron may still increase the Hb.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Such patients may also require an ESA, but a loading dose of iron should be given first with repeat assessment of Hb prior to starting the ESA.

ESAs are effective in treating anemia. Among hemodialysis patients with severe anemia, ESAs reduce the need for transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and improve quality-of-life symptoms, exercise tolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy, which has been associated with mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].</p><p>An important exception is patients with malignancy, particularly those in whom cure is anticipated or who have had a stroke, since such patients may be at higher risk for adverse effects from ESAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The treatment of such patients should be individualized after careful consideration and discussion of the possible risks and benefits of ESA therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3046622893\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal target Hb for ESA dosing is not known. Recommendations for target levels are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2992892097\" class=\"local\">'Target levels'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1895687524\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, we initiate treatment with erythropoietin approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> three times per week. This is a relatively low starting dose, which decreases the risk of an overly rapid increase in Hb, which may be associated with more adverse effects. Among patients with severe or symptomatic anemia, however, we may use a higher starting dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> three times per week. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended starting dose is 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> three times per week for both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous administration. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) anemia guidelines do not indicate a specifically recommended starting dose but state that the dose should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>].</p><p>Other ESAs used for treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients include darbepoetin, with US FDA-recommended starting doses of 0.45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> every week or 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> every two weeks, and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin, with US FDA-recommended starting doses of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> every two weeks.</p><p>We titrate the dose upwards as necessary to achieve the target Hb level (see <a href=\"#H2992892097\" class=\"local\">'Target levels'</a> below). The dose of ESA required to reach target Hb varies widely among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Generally, the dose is adjusted monthly in response to the Hb. The Hb increase should generally be less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> per month since more rapid increases of Hb may be associated with adverse effects. The dose of ESA should be reduced in patients whose Hb rises above this threshold increase. Among those with an Hb increase greater than 2.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> per month, the ESA dose should be held or reduced by at least 50 percent. While some clinicians reduce the ESA dose (as is recommended in the KDIGO anemia guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]), holding the ESA completely may reduce the number of times that the Hb exceeds target and decrease the ESA used per dialysis session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3790520714\" class=\"local\">'Continued monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1501780353\"><span class=\"h3\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either IV or subcutaneous ESA administration may be used. Several studies have shown that the subcutaneous dose of ESA required to achieve a target Hb is approximately 30 percent less than that required with IV administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. This was best shown in one of the largest prospective studies, in which 208 hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either subcutaneous or IV erythropoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At 26 weeks, the average subcutaneous erythropoietin to achieve target Hb levels was lower than the IV dose (95 versus 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per week). This is an important consideration since higher ESA doses (independent of Hb) may be associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. A retrospective study of over 62,000 hemodialysis patients confirmed that equivalent Hb levels were obtained with 25 percent less erythropoietin administered subcutaneously compared with IV administration but also found that the composite adverse event outcomes of death <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization for cardiovascular complications (heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke) were more common in IV erythropoietin-treated patients, perhaps due to the higher erythropoietin dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>However, IV administration is often favored for hemodialysis patients because subcutaneous administration is associated with significantly greater discomfort and IV access is available for the dialysis treatment. In the United States, over 90 percent of hemodialysis patients received ESAs intravenously in a report published in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Subcutaneous administration used to be more commonly used outside the United States. However, a reduction in use of subcutaneous ESAs followed an outbreak of pure red cell aplasia attributed to subcutaneous use of a particular ESA formulation that was not available in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. In the report cited above, IV administration was the major route in 11 of 12 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. More recent information about administration practices in different countries is not available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2992892097\"><span class=\"h3\">Target levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ESAs have been shown to provide benefit compared with no ESAs, the optimal target Hb level for hemodialysis patients is not well defined. In most dialysis patients who are treated with ESAs, we maintain levels between 10 and 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. We individualize therapy in some patients who may have improvements in quality of life at Hb &ge;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and will be prepared to accept the risks associated with higher Hb targets. We do not target an Hb concentration &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3046622893\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents'</a> below.)</p><p>The lowest ESA dose necessary to achieve a desired Hb level should be used, and excessively high doses in patients with ESA hyporesponsiveness should be avoided. Limited evidence suggests that an increased mortality may be due to high ESA doses. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In clinical practice, it is difficult to maintain individual patient Hb values within any narrow range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. While we try to maintain Hb levels between 10 to 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in most patients, Hb levels &gt;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> will occur transiently in many patients due to a variety of factors and should prompt appropriate gradual dose reductions in the ESA being used. Such transient elevations of Hb &gt;11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are not likely to be associated with important clinical consequences, although some (but not all) studies have reported an association between greater degrees of Hb variability and adverse clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Our recommendations for target Hb reflect both regulatory and fiscal policies, as well as results of clinical studies. The US FDA boxed warning on ESAs states that, for patients on dialysis, one should initiate ESA treatment when the Hb level is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and reduce or interrupt the ESA dose if the Hb level approaches or exceeds 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the KDIGO 2012 guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Among all chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (ie, dialysis and nondialysis), multiple studies have shown that Hb targets &gt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are associated with adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8,34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34-40</a>]. The best data among hemodialysis patients are from the Normal Hematocrit Trial (NHT), in which 1233 hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease, defined as heart failure or ischemic heart disease, and baseline Hb values of 9 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> on an ESA were randomly assigned to achieve and maintain an Hb of either 14 or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The study was terminated after 29 months after concerns about safety were raised by an independent data monitoring committee. The group targeted to Hb 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (ie, normal Hb) had a higher risk of the combined endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI; relative risk [RR] 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.9). After 29 months, there were 183 deaths and 19 nonfatal MIs in the 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group versus 150 and 14, respectively, in the 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group. The one- and two-year mortality rates were 7 percent higher in the 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group than in the 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group. In addition, the risk of thrombosis of grafts and fistulae in the 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group was higher than in the 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> group. No differences were initially reported between the groups for all-cause hospitalization or other endpoints such as nonfatal MI or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, according to the trial report submitted to the US FDA, the higher hematocrit group had a higher rate of hospitalization, although the difference was of marginal statistical significance (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In addition to these data, which were limited to hemodialysis patients, a number of meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been performed, mostly including nondialysis CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/34,35,37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,37,39,40</a>]. Although limited by heterogeneity, most suggest that targeting higher Hb levels with ESAs does not lower mortality and increases cardiovascular risk and the risk of malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ESAs may also not improve health-related quality of life among dialysis patients when comparing Hb levels of approximately 9 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to higher levels. Perhaps the best data are from a meta-analysis including 17 randomized trials that specifically reported on changes in health-related quality of life using validated instruments including the Short Form (SF)-36 (13 studies) and the Kidney Disease Questionnaire (KDQ; four studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The SF-36 reports on eight domains including physical function, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, emotional role, social function, and mental health. The KDQ reports on fatigue, depression, relationships with others, frustration, and physical symptoms.</p><p>The achieved Hb was 7.4 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> in the placebo-treated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower Hb target group and 10.2 to 13.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> in the higher Hb target group.</p><p>While in some of the individual published studies there were statistically significant improvements in one or more of the SF-36 physical function scores, in the meta-analysis, there were no significant differences between groups in any SF-36 or KDQ domains when comparing Hb levels of 9 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> compared with Hb levels &gt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Some quality-of-life measures do improve in some patients as Hb levels are raised from lower levels up to approximately 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Among studies that reported SF-36 results, there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward improvement in physical function in the nondialysis CKD subgroup but not in the dialysis subgroup.</p><p>However, confidence in the meta-analysis is somewhat limited by the high risk of bias in most of the studies and by the considerable heterogeneity in study population, design, and achieved Hb concentrations.</p><p>It is possible that selected individuals, particularly younger, active patients who have severe anemia but few other comorbidities, may benefit from maintaining the Hb above the 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with respect to quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3046622893\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some adverse effects have only been described when ESAs are used to attain a normal Hb. As noted above, these include increased mortality, cardiovascular events, and malignancy (see <a href=\"#H2992892097\" class=\"local\">'Target levels'</a> above). There is also an increased risk of hemodialysis access thrombosis when ESAs are used to maintain normal or near-normal Hb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,43,44</a>].

A 2004 meta-analysis showed no increase in the incidence of seizures among patients treated with an ESA compared with those not treated with an ESA; however, included studies were of both predialysis and dialysis CKD patients, which may have resulted in an underestimate of incidence among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There is little evidence of increased incidence of seizures in normotensive patients treated with an ESA.
