This causes the muscles to weaken. The muscles slowly stop working, leaving the person unable to move (called &quot;paralysis&quot;). Over time, the disease gets worse and leads to death. ALS is also known as &quot;Lou Gehrig's disease,&quot; after the famous baseball player who died of the disease.</p><p>Most people who get ALS live only a few years after their symptoms begin. There is no cure for ALS, but doctors can treat the symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831178174\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ALS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak arm or leg muscles, usually starting in one arm or leg and later spreading to other parts of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking or swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow, stiff, or awkward movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle twitches and spasms</p><p/><p>If a person gets weak muscles in the hands or arms, he or she might have problems with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using buttons or zippers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Handling coins or other small things</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Writing</p><p/><p>If a person gets weak muscles in the legs or feet, he or she might have problems with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking and turning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Climbing stairs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standing up from a chair or the floor</p><p/><p>If these symptoms happen, the person might have other problems, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like the legs are &quot;heavy&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dragging the front of the foot on the ground when walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tripping or falling</p><p/><p>If a person gets weak muscles in the head, neck, or chest, he or she might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a stiff jaw and a hard time opening the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble moving the mouth and tongue to speak clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drool</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not be able to fully close the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble holding up the head due to weak neck muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Some people with ALS have mood changes. They also might laugh, cry, or yawn at times when it doesn't make sense to do those things. In a few people, ALS affects the mind and causes problems with thinking clearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831178189\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for ALS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor might be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But your doctor will probably do tests, such as electromyography (also called &quot;EMG&quot;), to check how well your nerves and muscles are working. You might also need other tests to check that a different problem isn't causing your symptoms. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; This is an imaging test that takes pictures of your brain and spinal cord.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831178204\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ALS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for ALS include a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=riluzole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">riluzole</a> (brand name: Rilutek). This medicine works by slowing down the progress of the disease a little bit. It can help people live a few months longer. Another medicine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edaravone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">edaravone</a> (brand name: Radicava), might also help slow the progress of ALS in some people.</p><p>Other treatments help people cope with the symptoms of ALS. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing support &ndash; For this treatment, you wear a tight-fitting mask on your face or nose. Air and oxygen flow through the mask to help you breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding tube &ndash; This is a small, flexible tube that goes through the skin over your belly into your stomach. You can then get special liquid food and fluids through the tube directly into your stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices to help with walking and talking, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A cane, crutches, or motorized wheelchair.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A special computer that &quot;talks&quot; for you. You can control the computer with hand or eye movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat muscle spasms and weakness, drooling, sleep problems, pain, and depression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8721469\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysarthria-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysarthria (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
