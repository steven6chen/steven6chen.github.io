Although GBS colonization usually remains asymptomatic in these women, maternal colonization is the critical determinant of infection in neonates and young infants (less than 90 days of age), in whom GBS is the most common cause of bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Vertical (mother-to-child) transmission primarily occurs when GBS ascends from the vagina to the amniotic fluid after onset of labor or rupture of membranes, but can occur with intact membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In the mid-1980s, randomized and controlled clinical trials demonstrated that intrapartum administration of intravenous penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> to GBS carriers protected their newborns from developing early-onset disease (ie, GBS infection at 0 to 6 days of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Based upon this evidence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published updated guidelines for prevention of neonatal GBS disease in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The key intervention of these guidelines is intrapartum parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis of women whose infants are at risk of developing early-onset GBS infection because a maternal GBS culture was positive in the weeks before delivery or because of maternal characteristics that increase the risk of early-onset GBS disease in their offspring.</p><p>The 2010 CDC guidelines for prevention of early-onset GBS disease will be reviewed here. These guidelines have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Colonized women can be identified directly by culture or indirectly by the presence of specific maternal characteristics.</p><p>Women who are identified antepartum as high risk for GBS colonization should be informed of this status and the need to call their obstetric provider as soon as labor begins (preterm or term) or membranes rupture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2760920\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing culture versus risk factor-based screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first CDC guidelines published in 1996 for use of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS infant disease allowed either culture-based or risk-based strategies. The culture-based approach involved performing routine antepartum GBS vaginal and rectal cultures on all pregnant women, with a few exceptions for women at very high risk of having an infected infant; all colonized women received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The risk factor-based approach administered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to women with intrapartum risk factors for infant infection (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factor-based approach'</a> below). Although randomized trials directly comparing these two strategies had not been performed at the time these guidelines were written, the bulk of evidence supported culture-based screening followed by intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of women with positive results since the majority of cases of early-onset disease occur in infants of women who have no identifiable risk factors or in whom risk factors are not identified in time to provide effective chemoprophylaxis.</p><p>The value of routine cultures, rather than assessment of risk factors, was best demonstrated in a retrospective cohort study of deliveries in the United States from 1998 to 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Performing lower vaginal and rectal screening cultures at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation and administering antibiotic prophylaxis to GBS carriers was associated with fewer cases of early-onset GBS disease in neonates than prophylaxis based upon the presence of one or more maternal risk factors (adjusted RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60). In fact, almost one in five culture-positive women did not have maternal risk factors for early-onset neonatal infection and would not have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Based primarily on this study, but also on results from other controlled studies, major organizations in the United States, including the CDC, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and American Academy of Pediatrics, have recommended screening cultures over risk-based screening for GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4902919\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture-based approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CDC recommends GBS rectovaginal screening cultures for <strong>all pregnant women at</strong>&nbsp;<strong>35 to 37 weeks of gestation</strong>, with the following two exceptions: (1) women with GBS bacteriuria (&ge;10<sup>4 </sup>colonies in pure culture or mixed with a second microorganism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) during the current pregnancy and (2) women who previously gave birth to an infant with invasive GBS disease (see <a href=\"#H4903354\" class=\"local\">'Exceptions'</a> below). Cultures are performed near term because many women have transient or intermittent colonization, thus GBS colonization status in early pregnancy may not be predictive of status late in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. Cultures are performed at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation because the results will be available before most women go into labor and are reasonably predictive of GBS status for about five weeks. The negative predictive value of GBS cultures performed &le;5 weeks before delivery is 95 to 98 percent, but declines after five weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4903354\"><span class=\"h3\">Exceptions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>GBS bacteriuria in current pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Women with GBS bacteriuria (any colony count) anytime in the current pregnancy should routinely receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, even if bacteriuria is treated and a repeat urine culture is negative; therefore, they can be excluded from culture-based screening. The rationale for this recommendation is that GBS bacteriuria is a marker of heavy anovaginal colonization (the source of GBS bacteriuria in these women), treatment of bacteriuria during pregnancy does not achieve long-term eradication of anogenital colonization, and the neonates of women with GBS bacteriuria are at higher risk for early-onset GBS disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is expert consensus that symptomatic or asymptomatic women with GBS bacteriuria &ge;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> during pregnancy should be treated according to current standards for treating bacteriuria during pregnancy. The utility of treating GBS bacteriuria at colony counts &lt;10<sup>4 </sup><span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> is uncertain; some favor treatment to prevent urinary tract and other sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], while others do not treat patients with low levels of bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One randomized trial showed a decrease in preterm birth when asymptomatic women with GBS bacteriuria at ANY colony count at 27 to 31 weeks were treated with penicillin 1 million IU three times per day for six days compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These issues are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delivery of an infant with early-onset GBS disease in a previous pregnancy</strong> &ndash; There is also good evidence that previous delivery of an infant with early-onset GBS disease is associated with a higher risk of early-onset disease in subsequent deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/11,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-23</a>]. For this reason, women with this history should routinely receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and therefore can be excluded from culture-based screening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women with a history of a positive GBS culture in one or more previous pregnancies but no infant with early-onset GBS disease should be cultured in every pregnancy. Although a history of GBS colonization in a prior pregnancy is a risk factor for colonization in subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], 50 to 60 percent of these women are not colonized in the subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] and should not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless colonization persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4902926\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure for obtaining GBS cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swabs for culture should be obtained, ideally before digital examination or use of lubricants, from both the lower vagina (vaginal introitus) and rectum (insert swab through the anal sphincter) to achieve maximum sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Either two swabs (one for each site) or a single swab can be used; one swab is more cost saving. The swabs may be obtained by either the healthcare provider or by the patient herself after appropriate instruction as studies have shown equivalent sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Some women prefer self-sampling and some physicians find it increases office efficiency.</p><p>A speculum should not be used to obtain the vaginal swab specimen. Sites other than the vagina and rectum (ie, cervical, periurethral, perianal, perirectal or perineal) should not be sampled as they are less sensitive for detection of GBS, and add to the cost.</p><p>Both swabs, or a single swab of each site, should be placed promptly into non-nutrient transport media (eg, Amies or Stuart's without charcoal) and transported at room temperature (in temperate climates) or refrigerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The swab or swabs are then transferred to a selective enrichment broth at a laboratory experienced in the isolation of GBS, incubated overnight at 37&ordm;C, and subcultured onto blood agar plates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57194\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57194 \">algorithm 1</a>). Use of selective enrichment media substantially improves detection of GBS by enhancing GBS growth and preventing overgrowth of other organisms that may mask growth of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The CDC guidelines include detailed steps for isolation and proper identification of the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cultures require 24 to 48 hours to show positive results. It takes 48 hours to definitively exclude GBS.</p><p>Susceptibility testing is not necessary in most cases because GBS isolates with confirmed resistance to penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> have not been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In patients with positive GBS cultures who have a serious allergy to penicillin (history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticaria), testing for sensitivity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> should be performed if one of these antibiotics is used for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Patients with penicillin allergy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4902953\"><span class=\"h4\">Incidental findings noted on culture report</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some laboratories report non-GBS streptococcal organisms identified during GBS screening cultures.&nbsp;In the only available study, group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (GAS) was present in 0.03 percent of rectovaginal cultures from pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The maternal-fetal-neonatal attack rate of GAS in this setting is unknown (described in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]). It is probably relatively low because the annual incidence of invasive GAS infection in postpartum women has been estimated to be 6 per 100,000 live births in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>We and others believe there is no clear role for preemptive treatment of asymptomatic GAS colonization identified in the course of routine prenatal care (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection#H99537817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy-related group A streptococcal infection&quot;, section on 'GAS screening in pregnancy'</a>). Opinions about management of these pregnancies vary among infectious disease experts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection#H99537817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy-related group A streptococcal infection&quot;, section on 'GAS screening in pregnancy'</a>). As an example, a 2012 guideline for prevention and control of GAS infection in acute health care and maternity settings in the United Kingdom stated &quot;pregnant women who are found to be infected with or carrying GAS prior to hospital admission should be treated at the time and have this clearly documented in the maternity notes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; this was an ungraded &quot;good practice point&quot; based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.</p><p>Consultation with an infectious disease expert may be helpful, such as in a pregnant or postpartum woman with the incidental finding of GAS on routine GBS screening culture plus risk factors for pregnancy-related GAS infection or patients with suspected GAS infection.

These risk factors can be used instead of cultures to identify women who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis in labor to reduce the risk of having an affected infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrapartum fever &ge;100.4&deg;F [&ge;38&deg;C]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery before 37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> weeks of gestation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture of membranes &ge;18 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous delivery of an infant affected by GBS disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GBS bacteriuria (&ge;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL)</span> in the current pregnancy</p><p/><p>Mathematical modeling suggests that these risk factors classify 25 to 30 percent of intrapartum women as at risk of GBS colonization, a prevalence similar to that predicted by a culture-based approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. However, a study that compared the risk-based approach to a culture-based approach for identifying women for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis found that nearly 50 percent of women who delivered infants with early-onset GBS disease had none of these listed risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The presence of prolonged rupture of membranes does not override a negative GBS culture within the previous five weeks; GBS prophylaxis is not indicted in this setting.

NAATs for GBS are commercially available and provide results in less than two hours from the time the specimen is received by the laboratory. These tests have not been universally adopted because of factors such as cost, inability to run susceptibility testing, and lower sensitivity than standard culture using selective enriched broth media. Compared to standard culture with selective broth media, the sensitivity of NAATs performed on non-enriched samples ranges from 62.5 to 98.5 percent, and 92.5 to 100 percent when performed on enriched samples (but use of enriched samples takes more time, reducing the major advantage of NAAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>We agree with the CDC that the benefits and limitations of currently available NAATs do not support their use to replace antenatal culture or risk-based assessment of intrapartum women with unknown GBS status. Therefore, women in labor with risk factors for GBS colonization and no antenatal GBS culture results should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (risk factors include gestational age &lt;37 weeks, GBS bacteriuria in current pregnancy, previous infant with GBS disease, temperature &ge;100.4&ordm;F [&ge;38.0&ordm;C], or rupture of amniotic membranes &ge;18 hours).</p><p>For women in labor at term with no risk factors for GBS colonization and no antenatal GBS culture, NAAT is an option, where available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Using a risk factor based approach alone, these women would not receive antibiotic prophylaxis; however, if NAAT results are positive, we would administer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, similar to women with positive antenatal GBS cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].

A review of early-onset neonatal sepsis from 2005 to 2014 indicated that GBS remained the most common cause, but while incidence was generally stable, it fell from 0.27 per 1000 live births in 2005 to 0.22 per 1000 live births in 2014 (p = &#160;02), with a higher incidence if birth weight was &lt;1500 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3207583329\"><span class=\"h3\">Late-onset GBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the incidence of late-onset GBS infection (7 to 89 days after birth) has remained stable at an average 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/1000</span> live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].
