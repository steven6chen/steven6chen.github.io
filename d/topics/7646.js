For most children, gender assignment correlates with gender identity, which is the innate sense of maleness or femaleness. However, some children have a gender identity that does not correlate with assigned gender. These children are called gender-nonconforming or sometimes transgender. (See <a href=\"#H182326064\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> below.)</p><p>The trajectory of gender nonconformity in childhood is unpredictable; some children with gender nonconformity will grow up and be transgender adults, and some will grow up and be cisgender adults (ie, adults in whom gender identity matches genital anatomy). (See <a href=\"#H584043130\" class=\"local\">'Trajectory'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of gender development and the clinical presentation of gender nonconformity in children and adolescents. An overview of the management of gender nonconformity in children and adolescents and issues related to gender in children with disorders of sexual development are presented separately.

Many Western societies view gender as binary: male or female. This ideology sets an expectation that gender expression must conform to one or the other and may contribute to the pathologization of gender nonconformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When the gender expression of a child or adolescent does not fit neatly into the societal construct of male or female in congruence with their assigned sex, the child and family may be ostracized or stigmatized.</p><p>An alternate perspective views gender as a continuum from male to female, permitting a spectrum of gender identities with varying proportions of maleness and femaleness, but also includes neither or something else entirely. Societies that view gender according to this more fluid or developmental perspective may be more accepting of gender variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

As an example, many in the transgender community now use the terms &quot;affirmed female&quot; or &quot;transwoman&quot; and &quot;affirmed male&quot; or &quot;transman&quot; to describe genotypic males with a female gender identity and genotypic females with a male gender identity, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Gender discordant individuals may choose different terms than those listed above to describe themselves (eg, &quot;bigender,&quot; &quot;gender queer,&quot; &quot;gender fluid,&quot; &quot;gender creative,&quot; &quot;gender independent&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The terms that are used by professionals are less important than being sensitive to the individual patient's psychosexual profile and desired paradigm.</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) identifies a diagnostic entity &quot;gender dysphoria,&quot; which lists a series of experiences commonly endorsed by individuals with gender incongruence, followed by the association of distress caused by the incongruence. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the fourth edition, this was called &quot;gender identity disorder&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Core components of the DSM-5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria include long-standing discomfort with assigned gender and interference with social, school, or other areas of function.</p><p>Although the DSM-5 criteria for gender dysphoria may provide some insight into the experience of some gender-nonconforming persons, there are many gender-nonconforming persons for whom a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is neither accurate nor appropriate. The ongoing debate about whether or not gender nonconformity should be considered a &quot;disorder&quot; is beyond the scope of this topic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Viewing gender nonconformity from the developmental or fluid perspective of a gender continuum, rather than the pathologic perspective of a disorder, promotes understanding that all children may experience gender-nonconforming play and experimentation and may help to reassure families and professionals that exploring gender is a normal component of sexual development for many youth.

At approximately two-and-one-half years of age, they have the ability to label faces as male or female. Children between two and four years of age begin to understand gender differences, use gendered pronouns such as &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her,&quot; and can identify their own gender. By this age, most children also play with toys and games that correlate with their anatomic sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initially, children may view gender as subject to variation and change; by five to six years of age, their view of gender becomes more constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>Young children assume gender stereotypes for themselves and others; preschoolers begin sex segregation, playing more with same-sex peers, and furthering generalizable social constructs and gender-conforming roles and rules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20,21</a>]. In the school-age years, children may relax gender rules and regard gendered activities with more flexibility and choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, peer groups generally continue to be same sex; following rules, fitting in, and peer group acceptance is important in school-aged children.</p><p>Exploring gender and sexual behaviors is a normal part of child development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. At some point in childhood, many children experiment with gender expression and roles (eg, interest in cross-gender toys and games, cross-dressing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. However, for unknown and probably multifactorial biologic and psychosocial reasons, in some children, cross-gender behavior and expression is more consistent, persistent, and insistent than it is among their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

They may develop gender dysphoria as they begin to understand the constancy of assigned gender. However, gender dysphoria is unlikely to be recognized if the child is unable or unwilling to express it through activity or verbalization. Children who do not have the language or sophistication to express gender concerns may present in other ways (eg, mood or behavior problems).</p><p>The majority of prepubertal children with gender nonconformity do not continue to have a transgender identity during adolescence. Although it is impossible to predict the trajectory of gender nonconformity for an individual child, one characteristic that may distinguish long-term gender variance from a passing phase is the desire for genitals that correspond with gender identity. Gender-nonconforming genotypic males sometimes try to hide, or even cut off, their penises. Gender-nonconforming genotypic females may ask for a penis from their parents or pray that they wake up with one. Some children tell their parents that a mistake was made and they are in the wrong body.

Others, who suppressed feelings and expression of gender nonconformity during childhood, may experience feelings of gender dysphoria with increased intensity during pubertal development.

Self-harm (eg, cutting and burning), suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts are common among gender-nonconforming youth.

In retrospect, many youth acknowledge that early in childhood they felt as if something was &quot;different&quot; about them compared with their peers, but they did not have the words or concepts to describe the discordance between their body and their identity. Many youth begin to recognize this discordance and transgender identity as they listen to and observe other transgender persons in the media or social networking sites. In addition, delayed acknowledgment may be related to a fear of stigmatization, victimization, or rejection by family, friends, and employers. Some youth may internalize negative and rejecting social messages and are themselves transphobic (ie, fearful of gender nonconformity), creating further psychologic dissonance. Other barriers to disclosure include concerns about confidentiality or decreased access to care.</p><p>Specific concerns related to disclosure depend upon the timing of disclosure and social milieu. For a young person who is coming out and disclosing for the first time as a teenager, there are very real and concerning dangers. Planning for both safety and social support are critical to disclosure and transitioning. (See <a href=\"#H492231856\" class=\"local\">'Associated concerns'</a> above.)</p><p>Mental health therapists and medical providers can assist youth in developing a safety plan around disclosure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87390 \">table 2</a>). Youth may want to work in conjunction with advocacy organizations (eg, <a href=\"http://www.imatyfa.org/&amp;token=McmUHzbivMBbVmUkgiAMB5ZAvBlXpyjSzAL/4EIrTuE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83665\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TransYouth Family Allies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.transyouthequality.org/&amp;token=h1KzgOhLuVlx/jjaQGu7d+IMJtZis1Zqauxy+hgaYk31x8hAkVVz9PqYEH/A6GnU&amp;TOPIC_ID=83665\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Trans Youth Equality Foundation</a>) to facilitate disclosure to family members, friends, schools, and other organizations with whom the youth and family have contact. It is important for youth and providers to avoid making assumptions about who will or will not be supportive in the disclosure process. Many gender-nonconforming youth are surprised by family members and friends who become truly supportive and allies; many are devastated by the variety of responses that invalidate or deny their true identity. It is also important to explore networks and allies for parents as they proceed through their own cognitive, emotional, and social processing of their child's &quot;new&quot; identity. Social, religious, and emotional support may help parents and families who are struggling with these changes. (See <a href=\"#H462800773\" class=\"local\">'Role of the medical provider'</a> below and <a href=\"#H462800780\" class=\"local\">'Role of the mental health provider'</a> below.)</p><p>Many young people disclose to their parents in a letter. Some parents find out about their child's true gender identity from social networking sites. The choice of how to disclose to one's parents largely depends upon the existing relationship between parent(s) and the child. Writing a letter allows a young person to fully plan out what words to use and also does not require the young person to witness the parent's reaction. Because reactions from parents vary widely from overwhelming sadness, to disappointment, to anger and outrage, letter writing has become a popular strategy for disclosure.</p><p>The internet has provided some young people with a virtual environment in which to &quot;practice&quot; disclosure and live as one's true self with less risk of harm. This is probably why many young people initially disclose on a social media site (eg, Facebook). The disadvantage of disclosing first to one's cyberfriends is that parents may discover the information inadvertently and feel angry or hurt that their child has not shared the information with them. In many instances, parents or caregivers are most concerned about how they will be perceived as parents by family members, friends, and even strangers. While ultimately most parents care about the happiness of their child, this initial hurdle often causes great distress for the family. Disclosure decision-making strategies may benefit from the involvement of an experienced mental health therapist.

Prepubertal children with gender nonconformity may prefer clothing, hairstyles, toys, activities, and playmates that usually are reserved for the opposite sex; they may desire genitals that correspond with their gender identity. Pubertal children and adolescents may present with increased distress related to the physical changes of puberty. Children and adolescents who are unable to express their gender concerns may present with emotional or behavioral problems.

Disclosure of nonconformity during adolescence is associated with real and concerning dangers. (See <a href=\"#H492231856\" class=\"local\">'Associated concerns'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9259173\" class=\"local\">'Disclosure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is impossible to predict with certainty whether gender nonconformity in an individual child will persist into adolescence or adulthood.
