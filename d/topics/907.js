Although the incidence of pregnancy among women with congenital heart disease is increasing, the main causes of cardiac death in pregnancy are acquired heart disease: myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Anesthetic management of the pregnant woman with high-risk cardiovascular disease requires an understanding of the individual patient's cardiac anatomy and pathophysiology; how the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy, labor, and delivery have affected the patient; and the hemodynamic alterations that may be induced by the choices of analgesic or anesthetic techniques. Ideally, an individualized management plan is developed in the antepartum period by a team of providers (cardiologist, obstetrician, and anesthesiologist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Interdisciplinary communication and preparation are critically important since peripartum obstetric and cardiac complications may require rapid intervention.</p><p>This topic will discuss general considerations in the anesthetic management of the obstetric patient with high-risk acquired or congenital cardiovascular disease, emphasizing methods to minimize peripartum risk while providing optimal anesthetic care. All other aspects of management of heart disease during pregnancy, including specific cardiac pathology, are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired heart disease and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles&quot;</a>).

Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases, heart rate (HR) increases by 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> and preload increases due to an increase in blood volume. These changes result in a 30 to 50 percent increase in cardiac output (CO) above baseline. A physiologic dilutional anemia also develops. Cardiovascular and hemodynamic adaptations to normal pregnancy are summarized in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54685%7EOBGYN%2F61948%7EOBGYN%2F55985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54685 graphicRef61948 graphicRef55985 \">figure 1A-C</a>) and discussed in detail separately.

Also, the contracted uterus lifts off the vena cava, resulting in greater venous blood return to the heart, which increases SV. In fact, within the first 10 minutes following a term vaginal delivery, CO and SV increase by 59 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, unusual or ongoing blood loss during and immediately after delivery can counteract these effects.</p><p>After vaginal delivery, increases in CO and SV persist for at least one hour, while HR decreases and blood pressure (BP) remains unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These factors, in combination, typically result in unchanged mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the early postpartum period. However, patients with heart failure are at increased risk of developing pulmonary edema.</p><p>After cesarean delivery, MAP remains stable, but CO increases by approximately 30 to 50 percent, compared with predelivery values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Thus, anesthetic management should include contingency plans for obstetric complications such as the need for emergency cesarean delivery or postpartum hemorrhage, as well as plans for cardiopulmonary complications.</p><p>When the antepartum maternal condition is tenuous or potentially terminal, it is important to document the patient's resuscitative wishes in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRIC ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499650377\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women at high risk of maternal morbidity or mortality during labor or delivery, scheduling induction rather than waiting for spontaneous labor to begin may ensure that appropriate specialists are readily available (eg, cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, obstetric anesthesiologist, and neonatologist). High-risk patients are identified on a case-by-case basis using risk stratification guidelines (see <a href=\"#H2127955940\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above), and the clinical decision to schedule induction of labor versus allowing spontaneous onset of labor is multidisciplinary.</p><p>Induction of labor, if required, is generally safe and usually performed in a conventional manner (eg, cervical ripening with Foley catheter or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, amniotomy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a>). Placement of appropriate maternal monitoring devices (discussed below), intravascular access, and other preparations for analgesia and anesthesia should take place before contractions begin. If an epidural catheter is in place, pain control can be implemented promptly when needed, thus mitigating hemodynamic instability related to the pain and stress of labor.</p><p>Women with significant cardiovascular disease should be placed in a semirecumbent position with a lateral tilt during the intrapartum period. Vital signs should be assessed frequently between uterine contractions. Cardiac decompensation may mandate initiation of intensive medical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499650398\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal delivery is generally preferred unless there is an obstetric indication for cesarean delivery. In high-risk cardiac patients, obstetric management of labor and delivery may be modified to accommodate the limitations imposed by cardiac dysfunction. Neuraxial analgesia is generally required; if neuraxial analgesia is not an option, then the advisability of vaginal delivery may need to be reconsidered.</p><p>Cesarean delivery is rarely performed solely for a maternal cardiac indication. Exceptions may include aortopathy (eg, aortic dissection, dilated aorta &gt;4.5 cm for patients with Marfan syndrome or another genetically triggered aortic disorder, or progressive aortic enlargement during gestation), in which repetitive increases in cardiac output (CO) related to contractions and pushing may increase the risk of aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79834%7EOBGYN%2F69056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79834 graphicRef69056 \">figure 2A-B</a>). Other cardiovascular disorders that may be managed with cesarean delivery are severe pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome, as these patients may develop right ventricular failure with cardiogenic shock. The appropriate route for delivery, determined on a case-by-case basis, is discussed in topics addressing each specific cardiovascular lesion.</p><p>Maternal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation with a therapeutic international normalized ratio before delivery is a possible indication for cesarean delivery because the fetus is also anticoagulated, increasing the risk of fetal intracranial hemorrhage, particularly during vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734053676\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal &quot;cardiac delivery&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a maternal &quot;cardiac delivery&quot; with epidural analgesia, fetal descent during the majority of the second stage is accomplished exclusively by uterine contractions without the aid of maternal expulsive efforts. When the fetal head reaches the pelvic floor, a low or outlet operative vaginal delivery (either forceps or vacuum extraction) is performed. This avoids the physiologic changes associated with maternal pushing (eg, Valsalva maneuver or increased intrathoracic pressure resulting in decreased venous return, decreased preload, and decreased CO). Although the appropriateness of &quot;cardiac delivery&quot; is controversial, the maternal and fetal risks of operative vaginal delivery relative to the maternal cardiac risk associated with Valsalva maneuvers are individually determined for each patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The anesthesiologist may evaluate maternal hemodynamic tolerance of pushing including pulse oximetry waveform and saturation. This is especially helpful in patients with intracardiac shunts because of the concern for right-to-left shunt with increased intrathoracic pressure. The resultant decrease in oxygen saturation may stress the fetus. For optimal monitoring, it may be necessary to position the pulse oximetry probe on an earlobe or other area since many women use a handgrip during pushing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173028183\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocarditis prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Vaginal or cesarean delivery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1571125837\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of drugs commonly used in the labor unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following medications are often or routinely used during labor or postpartum.

The safety of these drugs depends on the patient's underlying cardiovascular physiology. For example, the reflex tachycardia that may occur with hydralazine administration may be undesirable in patients with mitral stenosis. Also, nifedipine should be avoided in women with aortic stenosis or HCM because decreasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases coronary perfusion to the thickened myocardium in aortic stenosis and can worsen outflow obstruction in HCM.

Certainly, proceeding with caution with initial dosing of the epidural in cardiac patients is of paramount importance. In fact, it is reasonable to consider each subsequent dose of epidural local anesthetic solution to be a &quot;test dose.&quot; Thus, we administer epidural doses in 3 to 5 mL increments every five minutes, while asking the patient for signs and symptoms of an intravascular or intrathecal injection.
