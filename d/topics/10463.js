Other nonpharmacologic measures that may be considered include knee braces and walking aids as well as psychological interventions. Additional medications may be required, including regular oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intraarticular steroids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>. Surgery is generally reserved for refractory symptoms.</p><p>There are also general principles of management that apply to all patients with OA, including education, self-management, and goal-setting, which are discussed separately in detail.

A meta-analysis of four trials including 240 participants showed that exercise has beneficial effects on pain, even for patients with severe disease awaiting total knee replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Aquatic exercise has been associated with reduced rates of adverse events compared with land-based exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and is a good option for patients with moderate to severe pain due to the lower load to the knees. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H849299743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2337950959\"><span class=\"h3\">Knee braces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valgus (or unloader) knee bracing has been used to shift the load from the medial compartment with intent to relieve pain and improve function in patients with medial tibiofemoral (TF) joint OA. Our approach is to use a brace, as an adjunct to the other core treatments, for patients who are amenable to this intervention and likely to comply with the treatment. Patients with medial TF OA who are more physically active and usually younger may experience greater improvements with unloader knee bracing.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of six randomized trials, use of a brace compared with standard care (no orthosis use) was associated with a moderate improvement in both pain and function, while overall small improvements in pain were found when valgus bracing was compared with an orthosis control group (neutral knee brace, neoprene knee sleeve, or insoles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There was great heterogeneity in the comparator and in the prescription of braces across the six studies included in the meta-analysis. In a randomized trial including 80 patients with medial knee OA comparing valgus bracing with a neutral brace, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in pain in the brace group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In general, up to 25 percent of patients experience minor complications of bracing such as slipping and poor fit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, relatively low compliance rates (45 to 58 percent in parallel-group studies) may also hamper optimal results in clinical practice.</p><p>Patellofemoral (PF) taping and bracing, on the other hand, aim at reducing joint stress in patients with symptoms arising from the PF joint and presence of patellar malalignment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patellofemoral-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patellofemoral pain&quot;</a>). There is evidence that patellar taping markedly improves pain in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], while PF bracing seems a more appealing option for long-term use such as in patients with PF OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a crossover trial did not find differences in pain reduction when PF OA participants wore a specific type of off-the-shelf brace with or without the realigning strap applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On the other hand, another study found small improvement in pain in the group that wore the brace for a mean of 7.4 hours daily for six weeks compared with a no-brace control group. In addition, the brace group had greater reduction in PF bone marrow lesion volume, suggesting a potential structure-modifying effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1467167468\"><span class=\"h3\">Walking aids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a walking stick (cane) in the contralateral hand (unaffected side) for patients with significant mobility impairment due to OA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moderate to severe pain resistant to other treatment options. A randomized trial found that use of a cane daily for two months led to small improvements in pain in patients with knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178769028\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychological interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We refer patients for psychological interventions for pain-coping skills training if appropriate and if the service is available. Chronic knee pain and its impact on functionality often lead to various levels of psychological distress which, in turn, has a negative impact on symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is evidence showing that psychological interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), result in significant improvements in pain and physical and psychological disability in patients with chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It aims at teaching patients abilities to best cope with chronic pain through the modification of pain-related thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. In addition, coupling cognitive behavioral strategies to the exercise training <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight loss interventions has resulted in improved adherence and optimized outcomes in clinical trials with knee OA patients and in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These interventions are conditionally recommended by the American College of Rheumatology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] but are not specifically addressed in other OA guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-factors-and-rheumatic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial factors and rheumatic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Internet-based methods for providing psychosocial support with pain-coping skills training may also be effective. In a trial including 148 patients aged 50 years or older with knee pain and disability for at least three months, patients were randomized to either an intervention or a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Both groups had access to Internet-based educational material, but the intervention group also received interactive online training in pain-coping skills as well as videoconferencing sessions with a physiotherapist for home exercise. At three months, the intervention group reported significantly more improvement in pain and function compared with the control group, which was sustained for at least six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123818918\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic measures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3385575727\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend oral NSAIDs, preferably on an as-needed basis, in patients with moderate pain who have insufficient relief with topical NSAIDs or have symptomatic OA in multiple joints such as the hip and spine. In patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity (eg, advanced age, hypertension, concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use), we use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> or a nonselective NSAIDs with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). We use a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAID (coxib) in combination with a PPI in patients with higher risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as past history of gastric ulcer, or with presence of multiple risk factors, although we strongly recommend avoiding using NSAIDs in these circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3305189617\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice and use of oral NSAID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of NSAID is based upon a variety of factors including adverse effect profile, patient comorbidities, cost to patient, and patient preference regarding frequency of administration. Some studies suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and etoricoxib 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are the most effective NSAID regimens in knee OA, with efficacy varying greatly across different NSAIDs and doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In patients suitable for nonselective NSAIDs, we usually initiate treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meloxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meloxicam</a>, diclofenac, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> based on the considerations above. In patients with inadequate pain relief, regular NSAID use with gradual increase in dose may be necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 1</a>). Switching to another NSAIDs may be advantageous for some patients, although there is limited evidence supporting this approach. We usually consider other treatment options for patients with refractory symptoms despite the use of NSAIDs on a regular basis.

In a 2015 meta-analysis of data from 137 randomized trials comparing the efficacy of NSAIDS with other therapies for knee OA, all of the NSAIDs examined were found to be more effective for pain reduction when compared with acetaminophen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> were as effective at reducing pain as intraarticular corticosteroids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>. However, this study had many limitations, including the short-term follow-up period of only three months. Another large network meta-analysis comparing NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or placebo for the treatment of pain for either hip or knee OA found that all of the NSAIDs included in the analysis improved estimates of pain when compared with placebo or acetaminophen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45503037\"><span class=\"h4\">Adverse effects of oral NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be informed of the potential cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other major risks of both nonselective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors. In order to minimize toxicity, intermittent short- to mid-term use as required, in the minimal dose necessary to control symptoms, should be preferred over long-term fixed doses.

Sensitization of the central nociceptive processing has been increasingly recognized as a potential contributor to pain in knee OA patients. The analgesic efficacy of duloxetine has been demonstrated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials and is presumably related to the modulation of endogenous pain inhibitory pathways through the selective inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a meta-analysis of three trials, the relative risk of experiencing a 30 and 50 percent improvement in pain intensity with duloxetine compared with placebo was 1.49 (95% CI 1.31&ndash;1.70) and 1.69 (95% CI 1.27&ndash;2.25), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Its efficacy was also demonstrated in patients already taking chronic oral NSAIDs with inadequate pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The effective dose studied, and that is also used in our clinical practice, was 60 to 120 mg once daily, with a lower starting dose (30 mg) and gradual increase to improve tolerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nausea occurred in 6 to 15 percent of patients; other side effects were fatigue, constipation, dry mouth, diarrhea, somnolence, and dizziness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1879045343\"><span class=\"h4\">Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We limit the use of intraarticular glucocorticoid injection to patients with moderate to severe pain and contraindications to or failure of other treatment options who are seeking short-term pain relief. This procedure, either as a single injection or multiple repetitive injections, is not routinely recommended in our clinical practice. Serial injections (every three months) are discouraged due to potential negative effects on the progression of cartilage damage in knee OA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In a Cochrane review, a single glucocorticoid injection into the knee has been shown to provide short-term pain reduction of small to moderate magnitude for up to six weeks post-injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. After this period, effects on knee pain and function are similar to that obtained with placebo injection. A randomized trial including 140 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and ultrasound features of synovitis found that injections of 40 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide every 12 weeks for two years were no different compared with placebo injections in terms of pain reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although the rate of adverse events associated with intraarticular injections in the short term are generally low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], longer term data suggest that there may be negative structural implications. In the aforementioned study, patients who received two years of intraarticular triamcinolone injections were found to have significantly greater cartilage volume loss measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients with greater pain, presence of effusion, and less structural severity may be more likely to benefit from intraarticular steroids, but data are contradictory across studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4068513063\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe joint damage, chronic pain sensitization, and presence of extraarticular factors, particularly psychosocial issues, can all negatively influence the treatment response and should be assessed and addressed accordingly.

(See <a href=\"#H1801952719\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients with moderate to severe knee OA, we suggest exercise for pain relief and joint protection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116142\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116142 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Aquatic exercise has been associated with reduced rates of adverse events compared with land-based exercises and is a good option for patients with moderate to severe pain due to the lower load to the knees. (See <a href=\"#H3005923126\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with moderate to severe medial tibiofemoral (TF) OA, we suggest use of a valgus (or unloader) knee brace as an adjunct to other core treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with medial TF OA who are more physically active and usually younger may experience greater improvements with unloader knee bracing. (See <a href=\"#H2337950959\" class=\"local\">'Knee braces'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with significant mobility impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moderate to severe pain resistant to other treatment options, we suggested a walking stick (cane) in the contralateral (unaffected side) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1467167468\" class=\"local\">'Walking aids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer patients for psychological interventions for pain-coping skills training if appropriate and if the service is available. (See <a href=\"#H2178769028\" class=\"local\">'Psychological interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with moderate to severe knee OA or who have symptomatic OA in multiple joints (eg, hip and spine), we suggest oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), preferably on an as-needed basis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The choice of NSAID is based upon a variety of factors including adverse effect profile, patient comorbidities, cost to patient, and patient preference regarding frequency of administration. (See <a href=\"#H3385575727\" class=\"local\">'Oral NSAIDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OA in multiple joints and concomitant comorbidities that may contraindicate oral NSAIDs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who have not responded satisfactorily to NSAIDs, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> 60 to 120 mg daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We start with a lower initial dose of 30 mg and gradually increase to improve tolerability. (See <a href=\"#H3625794345\" class=\"local\">'Duloxetine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We limit the use of intraarticular glucocorticoid injection to patients with moderate to severe pain and contraindications to or failure of other treatment options who are seeking short-term pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H1879045343\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer patients to surgery when significant joint-related symptoms persist despite the use of nonsurgical interventions. (See <a href=\"#H537551493\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several approaches that have been used to treat patients with knee OA that we generally do not recommend due to lack of data demonstrating efficacy. These include insoles and footwear, opioids, hyaluronans, platelet-rich plasma, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, glucosamine and chondroitin, other nutritional supplements, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and acupuncture.
