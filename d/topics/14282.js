Preventive health care is an important aspect of medical practice, leading to significant improvements in overall health in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Several complex issues are involved in providing effective preventive care. Clinicians need to prioritize and decide which of the many available preventive services to recommend and which to discourage to prevent harm from inappropriate tests or interventions. Clinicians also must find a way to deliver preventive services efficiently within the context of a busy clinical practice.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to prevention and how to prioritize preventive services and interventions. Basic epidemiologic principles of screening and recommendations for primary prevention of conditions that cause an important burden of suffering in adults are presented elsewhere.

Rather than performing a standardized comprehensive examination (&quot;full physical&quot;) on all patients, clinicians should individualize screening and prevention interventions to maximize value, which encompasses the tradeoffs between benefits, harms, and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505856475\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors to consider</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priority services may differ from patient to patient depending upon age, sex, and other risk factors. The effects of recommend preventive care interventions on longevity or quality of life vary over a 100-fold and the potential beneficial effect of any one intervention on an individual patient varies with his or her lifestyle habits, medical and family history, and other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

It is important to communicate risks and benefits to patients in a way that they can understand, which can be challenging because many patients have a limited understanding of probabilities. A 2014 systematic review found that patients are better able to understand absolute than relative risks, and that visual aids can be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms in the clinical considerations section of a USPSTF Recommendation Statement.</p><p/><p>Some services are not examined by the USPSTF but should be encouraged. For example, immunization recommendations are made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). Other services have not been examined by the USPSTF but should be discouraged. As an example, some screening tests have an unclear target condition (eg, some components of a multi-channel chemistry profile) and have uncertain benefit but probable harm if widely implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186697420\"><span class=\"h2\">Harms of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are harms associated with screening, including anxiety produced by false-positive screening tests, harms associated with diagnostic testing after a positive screening test, overdiagnosis of conditions that may be treated but would never have become clinically apparent, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Comorbid conditions may decrease the benefits and increase the harms associated with screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The benefits of screening may decrease as patients get older, particularly for cancer screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Cancer screening in older adults is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;, section on 'Cancer screening'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should make sure that patients are aware of potential harms prior to screening and take comorbidities into account when discussing screening. Patients may weigh potential benefits and harms of screening and in some cases, decide against screening. This is a reasonable decision that should be accepted by clinicians. The optimal screening rate is less than 100 percent when patients are adequately counseled regarding the potential benefits and harms (including costs) of screening.</p><p>Screening of patients who are unlikely to benefit from screening is common. An observational study of over 27,000 patients &ge;65 years found that 31 to 55 percent of patients with &ge;75 percent risk of nine-year mortality had received prostate, breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening within the previous two to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186697682\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO EFFICIENTLY DELIVER PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186697688\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic &quot;check-up&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no strict guidelines for the optimal frequency of periodic visits, and no evidence on which to base optimal frequency recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Annual examinations are not indicated for most younger patients, although people with chronic health issues (such as diabetes) warrant regular visits, with or without a periodic health maintenance visit, independent of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the absence of such indications, we suggest periodic health maintenance visits every three years for adult patients &le;49 years without chronic conditions, and annually for adults &ge;50 years. For people who have no chronic conditions and rarely see a clinician, a periodic health evaluation visit may be the only opportunity to discuss preventive care.</p><p>Preventive counseling and services are an important component of the periodic health check-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Preventive services are more likely to be discussed when patients have an established relationship with an identified clinician. Studies have shown that patients who were connected to a specific clinician have higher rates of preventive services received [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Patients with more visits to their primary care providers were more likely to undergo screening for colorectal and breast cancer, have lower incidence and mortality of colorectal and breast cancer, and lower overall mortality. Periodic visits may have other benefits, such as developing the patient-clinician relationship, relieving patient &quot;worry,&quot; and educating patients about how to access the health care system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>].</p><p>A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized trials found that general practice-based health checks were not associated with decreased mortality but were associated with small improvements in surrogate outcomes (blood pressure control, decreases in total cholesterol and body mass index), especially in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials (182,880 participants) of periodic health checks found no beneficial effect of general health checks on total mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.03), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, CI 0.91-1.17), or cancer mortality (RR 1.01, CI 0.92-1.12) despite increased detection of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and increased use of antihypertensives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, some studies were old so that treatment did not reflect current practice (such as use of statins), and there was heterogeneity among studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18348568\"><span class=\"h2\">Discussing stopping or reducing screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in recommendations that decrease the frequency or intensity of screening and stopping screening for patients with reduced likelihood of benefit are often particularly problematic in discussions with patients. Patients may be confused by these changes, especially if they view screening as something they can do to protect themselves from a feared condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. How best to explain the rationale for less-intensive or discontinuing screening is a clinical challenge. Although we know of no easy formula for conducting these discussions, some general suggestions may be useful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The idea that screening programs can lead to harm is often foreign to patients. Patients should be made aware that the primary issue underlying recommendations is the balance between the likelihood of benefit and the likelihood of harm. A discussion of hypothetical examples that illustrate how screening may lead to unnecessary, difficult, and possibly risky diagnostic procedures (such as lung biopsy) or treatment (such as chemotherapy for cancer that would not have become clinically apparent over the patient's lifetime) may be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One may acknowledge the patient's interest in preserving health and longevity and refocus the patient away from more intensive or longer screening toward other prevention activities that bring a higher likelihood of benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older patients with limited life expectancy, it may also be useful to start the discussion of stopping screening some years before actual stopping. Older patients, advised over years that screening is an important part of medical care, may view stopping screening as an indication that they are no longer &quot;worth&quot; the expense or effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Again, hypothetical stories may be used to illustrate the reality that the probability of benefit from screening decreases and the probability of harm from overdiagnosis increases in advanced age. In addition, harm occurs soon after screening while any benefit occurs only years after screening. For example, for colorectal cancer and breast cancer screening a patient must live 10 years to have a 1 in 1000 probability of having her life extended, and 16 years to have a 2 in 1000 probability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If a patient is overdiagnosed, however, he or she receives unnecessary treatment (often including surgery) soon after diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18348575\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive office systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creative approaches using office systems can assist in delivering needed preventive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As an example, practices have successfully used databases of eligible patients (eg, for flu shots, mammograms, diabetic eye exams, etc) and automatic reminders to outreach to patients and assist in delivering routine preventive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one study of interventions to promote screening for colorectal cancer, mailings to patients were somewhat more effective than electronic reminders to clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Finally, using decision aids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> training medical assistants to discuss important preventive services before a visit with a clinician can be more efficient and effective in helping patients make informed decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186697800\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate screening and prevention interventions need to be prioritized both for effectiveness in modifying target outcomes and for risk of the condition in the individual patient.
