Some authorities use the term &quot;necrotizing pneumonia&quot; or &quot;lung gangrene&quot; to distinguish pulmonary necrosis with multiple small abscesses from a larger cavitary lesion, but this actually represents a continuum of the same process. Lung abscesses are usually polymicrobial infections caused by strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria that colonize the oral cavity, but a range of pathogens can cause them.</p><p>The classification, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of lung abscess will be reviewed here. Aspiration pneumonia, which may precede the development of a lung abscess, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;lung abscess&quot; is often applied to reflect the clinical features that are useful in management decisions, such as duration of prior symptoms, presence of associated conditions, or microbial etiology.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung abscesses can be classified as acute or chronic based upon the duration of symptoms prior to presentation for medical care; symptoms present for one month or more are considered chronic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung abscess may be primary or secondary based upon the presence or absence of common associated conditions. Abscesses in patients prone to aspiration or patients who have been healthy previously are usually considered primary; the term &quot;secondary lung abscess&quot; typically indicates an associated bronchogenic neoplasm or systemic disease that compromises immune defenses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or organ transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung abscess can also be defined by the responsible microbial pathogen (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em> lung abscess, anaerobic bacterial lung abscess, or <em>Aspergillus</em> lung abscess).</p><p/><p>When no pathogen was recovered from expectorated sputum five decades ago, the lesion was referred to as a &quot;nonspecific lung abscess.&quot; It is now thought that these infections were caused by anaerobic bacteria. Putrid lung abscess refers to the offensive odor that is often found in patients with lung abscesses and is considered diagnostic of anaerobic bacterial infection. A review of more than 1000 reported cases of lung abscess during the antibiotic era indicates that approximately 80 percent were considered primary, 60 percent were putrid, 40 percent were &quot;nonspecific,&quot; and 40 percent were chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most lung abscesses arise as a complication of aspiration pneumonia and are caused by species of anaerobes that are normally present in the gingival crevices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The typical patient has a predisposition to aspiration due to a reduced level of consciousness (eg, alcoholism, drug abuse, general anesthesia, head trauma) or dysphagia. These patients also frequently have periodontal disease, especially gingivitis, with high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria in the gingival crevice as high as 10<sup>11</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL,</span> as many bacteria as can occupy a geometric space.</p><p>The first step in the development of a lung abscess is for the inoculum from the gingival crevice to reach the lower airways, which usually occurs while the patient is in the recumbent position. Infection is initiated either because the bacteria are not cleared due to suppressed consciousness or because the inoculum size is large due to a swallowing disorder. Pneumonitis arises first but, based upon the usual mixture of organisms, progresses to tissue necrosis after 7 to 14 days. This necrosis results in lung abscess <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an empyema; the latter can be due to a bronchopleural fistula or direct extension of infection into the pleural space.</p><p>One unique mechanism for the development of lung abscesses occurs in Lemierre's syndrome, or jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis. This infection begins in the pharynx (sometimes with an overt tonsillar or peritonsillar abscess) but spreads to involve spaces in the neck and the carotid sheath, which contains the internal jugular vein. Bacteremia due to <em>Fusobacterium necrophorum </em>and septic emboli to the lung, which subsequently cavitate, are all characteristic complications of this process once the vessels are involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tricuspid valve endocarditis, usually due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, also typically causes septic emboli that are widely distributed in both lungs. This is a common feature of endocarditis complicating injection drug use and an infrequent complication of septic venous thrombosis in other settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infective endocarditis in injection drug users&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suppurative-septic-thrombophlebitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung abscesses are usually polymicrobial infections. The discussion here focuses on bacterial causes, especially those caused by strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria that colonize the oral cavity, although <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and many other pathogens need to be included in the differential diagnosis.</p><p>The pathogens in lung abscess usually reflect the predominantly anaerobic flora of the gingival crevice and are often associated with gingival crevice disease such as gingivitis or periodontitis. The most common organisms are <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Bacteroides</em> (usually not <em>B. fragilis</em>), and <em>Fusobacterium</em> spp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62555 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].</p><p>Many other bacteria can also cause lung abscesses but do so substantially less commonly. Probably the most common non-anaerobes are <em>Streptococcus anginosus </em>and other facultatively anaerobic streptococci. These streptococci can cause monomicrobial lung abscess but most often are isolated in mixed infections with anaerobes.</p><p>Other bacteria that can cause monomicrobial lung abscess include <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], <em>K. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], other gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, <em>Legionella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], <em>Nocardia</em>, and <em>Actinomyces</em>. There have been occasional case reports of lung abscess caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, but the bacterial etiology is disputed due to the possibility of superinfection by anaerobic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-staphylococcus-aureus-infection-in-adults#H4440440\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Staphylococcus aureus infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection&quot;, section on 'Lung abscess'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Legionella infection&quot;, section on 'Legionnaires' disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nocardiosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of nocardiosis&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary'</a>.)</p><p>The bacteriology of lung abscess may be different in Taiwan as illustrated in a retrospective evaluation of 90 adults hospitalized with lung abscess from 1995 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unlike earlier studies in which anaerobic organisms predominated, gram-negative bacilli accounted for 36 percent of isolates. Other organisms included anaerobes (34 percent), gram-positive cocci (26 percent), and gram-positive bacilli (4 percent). Of the 118 pathogens identified, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> (25 percent) was the most commonly isolated pathogen, followed by <em>S. anginosus</em> group (16 percent).</p><p>An accompanying editorial noted that the study might have been biased since 25 percent of the patients had received antibiotics prior to culture, making recovery of anaerobes less likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the study may be limited due to selection bias in terms of which patients got transthoracic aspiration, since only 90 of 336 cases of lung abscess (27 percent) had evaluable microbiologic studies. However, the K1 strain of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> appears to be a more common pathogen in Taiwan than in other areas. Patients in Taiwan with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infection had a high rate of bacteremia in association with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Higher rates of abscess formation of other sites (eg, liver abscess) also appear to occur in patients in Taiwan with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infection compared with other regions.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;, section on 'Empyema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Studies for microbiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients show a typical presentation with indolent symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats for more than two weeks) combined with a typical underlying condition that leads to aspiration or a cavity in a dependent pulmonary segment, it is appropriate to suspect that anaerobic bacteria are involved.</p><p>Routine Gram stain and aerobic culture of expectorated sputum for aerobes should be performed, ideally before antibiotics have been started. Care must be exercised in interpretation since most yield deceptive contaminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As an example, <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>P. aeruginosa,</em> or other aerobic bacteria may be cultured from expectorated sputum in a patient with a putrid lung abscess, but treatment still needs to be directed at anaerobes. In addition, specimens may represent upper airway flora rather than lower airway pathogens or may be negative if antibiotics have already been started. Interpretation of sputum cultures in these cases must take into account the clinical features of the patient, concentrations of the different organisms found in the culture and Gram stain, and the antibiotics the patient has received. When <em>S. aureus</em> or a gram-negative bacillus is the cause of lung abscess and an adequate sputum specimen has been obtained, it is typically seen on Gram stain and has heavy growth in culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach should include evaluation of the expectorated secretions for evidence of putrid odor. If there is putrid sputum or empyema fluid, the diagnosis of anaerobic bacterial infection is confirmed. It is difficult to isolate anaerobic bacteria in these circumstances since most respiratory tract specimens (sputum or bronchoscopy aspirates) are contaminated by upper airway flora and are consequently inappropriate for anaerobic culture. However, empyema fluid is a good specimen type for Gram stain and anaerobic culture as well as aerobic culture. Note that this difficulty in obtaining specimens that are appropriate for anaerobic culture and the challenge of anaerobic cultures may contribute substantially to the substantial decrease in reported cases of anaerobic lung infections since the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Alternatively, there may simply be a decrease in incidence.</p><p>The only methods available for obtaining uncontaminated specimens are transtracheal aspirates (TTA), transthoracic needle aspirates (TTNA), culture of pleural fluid, or blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>]; TTA and TTNA are rarely performed currently. It is appropriate to obtain pleural fluid and blood cultures, but blood cultures are rarely positive for anaerobic bacteria in patients with lung abscess due to anaerobes. None of these specimens is likely to yield anaerobes after effective antibiotics are started. Thus, in the present era, the only anaerobic lung infections that are likely to have bacteriologic confirmation are those associated with an empyema. The same limitations apply to facultatively anaerobic streptococci.</p><p>A controversial alternative to TTA is bronchoscopic aspiration using a quantitative brush catheter or quantitation of organisms obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures seems to have documented benefit in determining pathogenic organisms in most pneumonia cases caused by aerobes, the experience with anaerobic lung infections is limited by the sparse number of cases that have been reported and by the number of laboratories that are capable of isolating anaerobes, which are oxygen sensitive. It should also be emphasized that none of these specimens is likely to yield anaerobes after antibiotics have been administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosing other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a less classic presentation or in whom the diagnosis of bacterial lung abscess is not clear, the differential diagnosis is broader and includes both infectious and noninfectious etiologies for the cavitary lesion. It is particularly important to exclude epidemiologically important organisms such as <em>M. tuberculosis</em>; placing the patient on airborne precautions is standard in such cases until tuberculosis has been excluded. A more invasive procedure, such as bronchoscopy, to obtain material for culture and cells to exclude a malignancy may be warranted under these circumstances.</p><p>Some patients with lung abscess have previously unrecognized underlying conditions such as an aspirated foreign body, a pulmonary neoplasm, or bronchial stenosis. At one time, it was recommended that all patients with lung abscess undergo bronchoscopy to detect underlying lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This recommendation is now reserved for patients who have atypical presentations and for those who fail standard therapy.

(See <a href=\"#H6599037\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p>Early diagnosis and specific therapy of opportunistic infections is the cornerstone of successful management in such patients. The general rule is to be aggressive in pursuing a specific microbiologic diagnosis in immunocompromised patients.

Approximately one-third of patients died, another one-third recovered, and the remainder developed debilitating illness with recurrent abscesses, chronic empyema, bronchiectasis, or other sequelae. Drainage via rigid bronchoscopy did not alter the mortality rate in this study, suggesting that lung abscess, in contrast with most other types of abscesses, does not require assisted drainage as long as the process spontaneously drains via the bronchus as indicated by the air-fluid level.</p><p>An early study of 1560 cases of lung abscess after the introduction of sulfonamides showed that these drugs had no important effect on the outcome of the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Resectional surgery and penicillin were commonly used for the treatment of lung abscess in the early 1950s, and the relative merits of surgery versus antibiotics were often debated. Antibiotics then became favored, using penicillin as the initial agent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> for those who did not respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/1,7,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,40-44</a>]. Patients who had persistent cavities at four to six weeks were defined as having &quot;delayed closure,&quot; and these patients were candidates for surgical resection. An important study from Philadelphia General Hospital in the 1960s showed that even patients with delayed closure eventually responded when antibiotics were simply continued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Since that time, surgery has been limited to only approximately 5 to 10 percent of cases in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2834250575\"><span class=\"h3\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antibiotic treatment of lung abscess is almost always empiric, reflecting the difficulty of obtaining specimens that are appropriate for anaerobic culture, the long time required to complete such cultures, and the fact that susceptibility testing of anaerobes is performed infrequently. Furthermore, the susceptibility pattern of anaerobes is usually predictable. There are few clinical trials regarding the treatment of anaerobic lung abscesses, due to the infrequency of their occurrence and the difficulty in establishing a microbial diagnosis.</p><p>Empiric regimens should penetrate the lung parenchyma and target both strict anaerobes and facultatively anaerobic streptococci. Drugs that are reasonable to use are any combination of a beta-lactam&ndash;beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> 3 g intravenously [IV] every six hours) or a carbapenem (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>); these choices are also supported by in vitro data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and modest experience with these agents is favorable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combination-beta-lactamase-inhibitors-carbapenems-and-monobactams\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combination beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, and monobactams&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Standard treatment for an anaerobic lung infection was formerly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (600 mg IV every eight hours, followed by 150 to 300 mg orally four times daily) based upon two trials that demonstrated superiority of this agent compared with parenteral penicillin in the response rates and speed of defervescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. However, we prefer the agents suggested above to avoid the risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection with clindamycin. Clindamycin remains an appropriate agent for those with beta-lactam allergy.</p><p>One of the reasons that an alternative to penicillin was originally tested was because more anaerobes began producing beta-lactamase and, thus, were resistant to penicillin. Examples of beta-lactamase&ndash;producing anaerobes involved in lung abscess include <em>Bacteroides ruminicola</em>, black-pigmenting strains of <em>Prevotella</em> (formally <em>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</em> group), <em>Bacteroides gracilis</em>, <em>Bacteroides ureolyticus</em>, Fusobacteria, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/8,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,48,49</a>]. Other data suggest that up to 40 percent of Fusobacteria and 60 percent of <em>Bacteroides</em> spp other than <em>B. fragilis</em> produce penicillinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> monotherapy for putrid lung abscess has been extremely disappointing, with an approximate 50 percent failure rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/45,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,49-53</a>]. This is best explained by the concurrent presence of facultatively anaerobic streptococci that presumably contribute to the pathogenesis of these infections in a substantial number of cases. Although metronidazole is probably the most active drug available against strictly anaerobic bacteria since it is uniformly active against oxygen-sensitive strains and has a time-kill profile that is unique compared with other drugs, it has no activity against streptococci. If metronidazole is used, it should be combined with penicillin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metronidazole: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4167876866\"><span class=\"h3\">Targeted therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When streptococci (ie, oral flora) are detected from a good quality sputum specimen from a patient with lung abscess, antibiotics should be selected that are active against both the pathogens that were detected and anaerobes. Most drugs used for strict anaerobes are also active against facultatively anaerobic streptococci, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>. The empiric regimens discussed above are appropriate choices for patients with a mixed anaerobic and streptococcal lung abscess. (See <a href=\"#H2834250575\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>When a single pathogen that is not a typical part of the oral flora is detected, it is often appropriate to tailor the regimen to target that pathogen. An exception is that if the sputum is putrid, then anaerobes are likely to be playing a role and the antimicrobial regimen should target not only the organism that was isolated but also anaerobes. The rationale for this is that anaerobes are difficult to culture and are likely to be present when the sputum is putrid. (See <a href=\"#H2834250575\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The appropriate antibiotic for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (eg, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>) should be selected based upon the results of in vitro susceptibility testing. A risk factor that makes a monomicrobial <em>S. aureus</em> lung abscess more likely is recent influenza infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'S. aureus'</a>.)</p><p>For methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em>, the agents of choice are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (2 g IV every eight hours), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> (2 g IV every four hours).

The main alternative to linezolid is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours, adjusted to a trough concentration of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and for renal function).

Ceftaroline is active in vitro against virtually all strains of MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], but it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MRSA pneumonia because the experience is too limited.

Some treat for three weeks as a standard and others treat based upon the response. Our practice is to continue antibiotic treatment until the chest radiograph shows a small, stable residual lesion or is clear. This generally requires several months of treatment, most of which can be accomplished with an oral regimen on an outpatient basis. Appropriate oral regimens will depend upon the infecting pathogen. For patients with a mixed anaerobic and streptococcal infection, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> is an appropriate regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], but the choice of regimen should be guided by susceptibility results when available.</p><p>There has also been interest in using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> because early studies showed good in vitro activity against anaerobes, and a small trial has shown benefit for aspiration pneumonia and primary lung abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, moxifloxacin has not been studied adequately to recommend it as a first-line agent for lung abscess, and the rate of resistance of anaerobes to this drug is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The rationale for extended treatment is the anecdotal experience with five patients who relapsed after therapy was discontinued despite receipt of antibiotics for more than eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is rarely required for patients with uncomplicated lung abscess. The usual indications are failure to respond to medical management (which is often merely a subjective impression), suspected neoplasm, or hemorrhage. However, several predictors of a slow response or no response are abscesses associated with an obstructed bronchus, an extremely large abscess (&gt;6 cm in diameter), and abscesses involving relatively resistant organisms, such as <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. The usual procedure in such cases is a lobectomy or pneumonectomy.</p><p>Alternative approaches for patients who are considered to be poor operative risks include percutaneous and endoscopic drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/60-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-68</a>]. Percutaneous procedures require special care to prevent contamination of the pleural space. Bronchoscopy may be done as a diagnostic procedure, especially to detect an underlying lesion, but this procedure is of relatively little use to facilitate drainage and can result in spillage of abscess contents into the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Endoscopic drainage, which requires an experienced operator, is performed by placing a pigtail catheter into the abscess cavity under bronchoscopic visualization, leaving the catheter in place until the cavity has drained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-abscess/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with putrid lung abscesses usually show clinical improvement with decreased fever within three to four days after beginning antibiotic treatment.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most lung abscesses arise as a complication of aspiration pneumonia and are caused by species of anaerobes that are normally present in the gingival crevices. The most common anaerobic organisms implicated in lung abscesses are <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Bacteroides</em> (usually not <em>B. fragilis</em>), and <em>Fusobacterium</em> spp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62555 \">table 1</a>). Many other bacteria can also cause lung abscesses but do so with substantially less frequency. Probably the most common pathogens other than strict anaerobes are <em>Streptococcus anginosus</em> and other oral streptococci; these often cause mixed infections with anaerobes. Other pathogens that cause lung abscess include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (especially methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [MRSA]) and various gram-negative bacilli (especially the K1 strain of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>). The most common agents in the immunocompromised host are <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other aerobic gram-negative bacilli, <em>Nocardia</em>, and fungi (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Cryptococcus</em> spp).

The characteristic features of anaerobic lung abscesses suggest pulmonary infection, including fever, cough, and sputum production. Evidence of chronic systemic disease is usually present, with night sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Patients may seek medical attention for these systemic symptoms, hemoptysis, or pleurisy. Nearly all patients have fever, but virtually none have shaking chills or true rigors. Most patients are aware of putrid or sour-tasting sputum.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Studies for microbiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine Gram stain and aerobic culture of expectorated sputum for aerobes should be performed, but care must be exercised in interpretation since most yield deceptive contaminants. In addition, specimens may represent upper airway flora rather than lower airway pathogens or may be negative if antibiotics have already been started. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Studies for microbiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is difficult to isolate anaerobic bacteria since most respiratory tract specimens (sputum or bronchoscopy aspirates) are contaminated by upper airway flora and are consequently inappropriate for anaerobic culture. The only methods available for obtaining uncontaminated specimens are transtracheal aspirates (TTA), transthoracic needle aspirates (TTNA), culture of pleural fluid, and blood cultures; TTA and TTNA are rarely performed currently. It is appropriate to obtain pleural fluid and blood cultures, but blood cultures are rarely positive for anaerobic bacteria. In the present era, the only anaerobic lung infections that are likely to have bacteriologic confirmation are those associated with an empyema. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Studies for microbiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric regimens should target both strict anaerobes and facultatively anaerobic species (ie, streptococci). For empiric treatment of a lung abscess, we suggest any combination of a beta-lactam&ndash;beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> 3 g intravenously every six hours) or a carbapenem (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2834250575\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a single pathogen that is not a typical part of the oral flora is detected, it is often appropriate to tailor the regimen to target that pathogen. An exception is that if the sputum is putrid, then anaerobes are likely to be playing a role and the antimicrobial regimen should target not only the organism that was isolated but also anaerobes (which are difficult to culture). (See <a href=\"#H4167876866\" class=\"local\">'Targeted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest continuing antibiotic treatment until the chest radiograph shows a small, stable residual lesion or is clear. This generally requires several months of treatment, most of which can be accomplished with an oral regimen on an outpatient basis. For patients with a mixed strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic infection, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> is an appropriate regimen, but the choice of regimen should be guided by susceptibility results when available. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Duration and switch to oral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Bartlett JG.
