Fortunately, treatment is available to effectively manage most stones. In addition, you can take steps to prevent kidney stones from recurring.</p><p>A detailed review of kidney stones in children is available separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information about kidney stones is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW KIDNEY STONES DEVELOP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A kidney stone can form when substances such as calcium, oxalate, cystine, or uric acid are at high levels in the urine. Stones can also form if these substances are at normal levels, especially if the amount of urine made each day is low. The substances form crystals, which become anchored in the kidney and gradually increase in size, forming a kidney stone.</p><p>Typically, the stone will move through the urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>) and is passed out of the body in the urine. A stone may cause pain if it becomes stuck and blocks the flow of urine. Large stones do not always pass on their own and sometimes require a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY STONE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain diseases, dietary habits, or medications can increase your risk of developing kidney stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64849 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY STONE SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common symptom when passing a kidney stone. Most commonly, pain only occurs with obstruction, in which the urine cannot pass freely from the kidney to the bladder. Pain can range from a mild and barely noticeable ache to discomfort that is so intense it requires treatment in the hospital. Typically, the pain gets worse and better but does not go away completely. Waves of severe pain, known as renal colic, usually last 20 to 60 minutes. Pain can occur in the flank (the side, between the ribs and the hip) or the lower abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>), and the pain can move toward the groin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood in the urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with kidney stones will have blood in the urine (hematuria). The urine may be pink or reddish, or the blood may be visible only with urine dipstick testing or microscopic examination of the urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gravel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You may pass &quot;gravel&quot; or &quot;sand,&quot; which are small stones in your urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other kidney stone symptoms include nausea or vomiting, pain with urination, and an urgent need to urinate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic kidney stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with stones that remain in the kidney and do not cause obstruction have no symptoms (asymptomatic means without symptoms). These kidney stones are usually found when an imaging study (such as an ultrasound, X-ray, or computed tomography [CT] scan) is performed for other purposes. Stones can remain in the kidneys for many years without ever causing symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The first kidney stone and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY STONE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney stones are usually diagnosed based upon your symptoms, a physical examination, and imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography (CT) scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A CT scan creates a three-dimensional image of structures within the body. A particular type of CT scan (called noncontrast helical CT) is often recommended if kidney stones are suspected because it is the best imaging test to see a kidney stone. Low-dose CT scans use significantly less radiation. Nonetheless, doctors still try to limit the number of CT scans a patient undergoes to minimize radiation exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ultrasound (or sonogram) can also be used to detect kidney stones, although small stones or stones in the ureters (tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder) may be missed. However, ultrasound is the procedure of choice for people who should avoid radiation, including pregnant women and children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY STONE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of a kidney stone that is causing obstruction depends upon the size and location of the stone, as well as your pain and ability to keep down fluids. If your stone is likely to pass, your pain is tolerable, and you are able to eat and drink, then you can be treated at home.</p><p>If you have severe pain or nausea, you will need to be treated with stronger pain medications and intravenous (IV) fluids, which are often given in the hospital. In addition, patients with stones and who also have a fever must be treated in the hospital as soon as possible to avoid a life-threatening infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Home treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can take non-prescription pain medication until the stone passes. This includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), but it is important to check with your doctor first.</p><p>Other medications, such as tamsulosin, may also be recommended to speed the passage of stones.</p><p>You will probably be asked to strain your urine to recover the stone; after you retrieve it, you should bring it to your doctor so it can then be analyzed in a laboratory to determine the composition of the stone (eg, calcium oxalate, uric acid, etc). Knowing what type of kidney stone you have is important in planning treatments to prevent future stones. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Kidney stone prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">If the stone does not pass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stones larger than 9 or 10 millimeters rarely pass on their own and generally require a procedure to break up or remove the stone. Some smaller stones also do not pass. Several procedures are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H229041378\"><span class=\"h3\">Ureteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteroscopy is a common endoscopic procedure that uses a thin scope, which is passed through the urethra and bladder, into the ureter and kidney. This endoscope allows the urologist to see the stone and remove it or to break up the stone into smaller pieces that can pass more easily. Ureteroscopy is often used to remove stones blocking the ureter and sometimes for small stones in the kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lithotripsy is a reasonable treatment option in many patients who need help passing a stone. Lithotripsy is particularly good for stones 1 cm or less in the kidney and upper ureter. Shock wave lithotripsy is not effective for treating large or hard stones. You may require medication to make you sleepy and reduce pain during lithotripsy treatment, although this depends upon the type of lithotripsy equipment used.</p><p>Lithotripsy is performed by directing high-energy shock waves toward the stone. These sound waves pass through the skin and bodily tissues and release energy at the stone surface. This energy causes the stone to break into fragments that can be more easily passed in the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extremely large or complex stones, or large stones resistant to shock wave lithotripsy, may require a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the stone. In this procedure, a small endoscopic instrument is passed through the skin (percutaneously) of the back into the kidney to remove the stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of asymptomatic stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a kidney stone that is causing no symptoms, you may or may not need to remove the stone. The decision is based upon the size and location of your stone, as well as your ability to be treated quickly if symptoms were to develop. If there is a chance that you would not be able to get treatment quickly (eg, if you travel frequently), you are more likely to be advised to have the stone removed.</p><p>Regardless of the decision to treat or not, you should be evaluated for underlying health conditions that can increase the risk of kidney stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64849 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY STONE PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you have a kidney stone attack, you should have blood and urine tests to determine whether you have certain health problems or dietary habits that increase the risk of kidney stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64849 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If you passed and saved the stone, it should be analyzed to determine the type of stone. In addition, your clinician may request that you perform a 24-hour urine collection (all the urine you make over a 24-hour period) to determine underlying risk factors for your kidney stone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon these test results, one or more of the following may be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You may be advised to drink more fluids to decrease the risk of another stone. The goal is to increase the amount of urine that flows through your kidneys and also to lower the concentrations of substances that promote stone formation. Experts recommend drinking enough fluid that you make more than 2 liters of urine per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You may be advised to make changes in your diet; the changes recommended will depend upon the type of kidney stone you have and the 24-hour urine results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You may be advised to take a medication to reduce the risk of future stones.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A kidney stone can form when there are normal or high levels of certain substances in the urine.
