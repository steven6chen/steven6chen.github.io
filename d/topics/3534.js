In the United States and other industrialized countries it is the major cause of cancer mortality, primarily because of exposure to cigarette smoke.</p><p>The epidemiology and risk factors associated with the development of lung cancer are reviewed in this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21308000\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of data examining the epidemiology of lung cancer comes from the developed world, where cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor. In the developing world additional risk factors, such as smoke and air pollution, may be particularly important.</p><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in men, and second most common in women. Worldwide, lung cancer occurred in approximately 1.8 million patients in 2012 and caused an estimated 1.6 million deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, lung cancer will occur in about 225,000 patients and cause over 160,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are substantial variations in lung cancer incidence between different countries and between men and women. These differences are a reflection in large part of differences in the prevalence of tobacco smoking. Changes in the incidence of lung cancer over time have been closely correlated with increases and decreases in the smoking of cigarettes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21308016\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking tobacco products (primarily cigarettes) is the most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is also a significant cause of lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21308038\"><span class=\"h2\">Cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking has been firmly established as the most important cause of lung cancer in industrialized North America and Europe. The possibility that inhalation of cigarette smoke might be a cause of lung cancer was first suggested in 1912 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since then, a large volume of epidemiologic evidence has confirmed the relationship between smoking and lung cancer and led to efforts to decrease smoking in the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>Differences in smoking habits between men and women have reflected the epidemiologic changes in the incidence of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. With the increase in smoking in women to levels very similar to those in men, there was an increase in lung cancer incidence. With the contemporary decrease in cigarette smoking, the incidence of lung cancer reached a plateau and then has decreased slightly in men. In women, the increase in rate was substantially delayed.</p><p>Estimates of the relative risk of lung cancer in the long-term smoker compared with the lifetime nonsmoker vary from 10- to 30-fold. The cumulative lung cancer risk among heavy smokers may be as high as 30 percent, compared with a lifetime risk of lung cancer of 1 percent or less in never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The risk of lung cancer increases with both the number of cigarettes smoked per day as well as the lifetime duration of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other factors that may influence the likelihood of developing lung cancer in smokers include the age at onset of smoking, the degree of inhalation, the tar and nicotine content of the cigarettes, and the use of unfiltered cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346211978\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cessation decreases the risk of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Estimates of risk reduction vary from 20 to 90 percent. The reduction in risk becomes evident within five years with a progressive decline associated with an increasing duration of abstinence. Case-control studies show that former smokers who had been abstinent for more than 15 years had an 80 to 90 percent reduction in risk of lung cancer compared with current smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. However, lung cancer risk remains higher than in the never-smoker, even after prolonged periods of complete abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. In fact, for the individual, the risk of lung cancer continues to rise with age, even after smoking cessation, but it rises at a much lower rate than it would have had smoking continued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The mortality benefit from smoking cessation was illustrated in a survey of smoking history in approximately 200,000 men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Adults who quit smoking gained 6 to 10 years of life expectancy, depending upon the age at which they quit smoking.</p><p>Smoking cessation may be beneficial even among patients who have been treated for lung cancer. In a systematic review with meta-analysis, ongoing smoking by patients with early- or limited-stage lung cancer was associated with increased likelihood of all-cause mortality, tumor recurrence, and development of a second primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21308353\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even if smokers are unable to quit, encouraging them to decrease smoking may result in harm reduction, including a decreased risk of lung cancer. An observational study that included 19,714 adults found that smokers who used &ge;15 cigarettes or an equivalent amount of tobacco in another form per day and who continued to smoke but cut back by at least 50 percent reduced their risk of lung cancer by 27 percent (95% CI 2 to 46 percent) after a mean follow-up of 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21313351\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondhand smoke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intensity of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ie, passive or &quot;secondhand&quot; exposure) is far less than that which occurs with active smoking. On the other hand, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can begin earlier in life than it does with active smoking, and the exposure to carcinogens occurs over a longer period of time. There is a dose-response relationship between intensity of exposure and relative risk of lung cancer.</p><p>The data supporting the relationship between secondhand smoke and lung cancer and the possible role of genetic factors are discussed separately.

Cigar smoking was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer (relative risk 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.1). There was a dose-response effect, with men who smoked five or more cigars per day having the greatest risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study, 137,243 men were followed for 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Men who smoked cigars only had an increased risk of death from lung cancer (relative risk 5.1, 95% CI 4.0-6.6) compared with nonsmokers. In a cohort study that followed 15,263 pipe-only smokers and 123,044 nonsmokers for 18 years, current pipe smoking was associated with an increased risk of death from lung cancer (relative risk 5.0, 95% CI 4.2-6.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

An association between lung cancer and smoking these agents has been difficult to prove because studies were limited by selection bias, small sample size, and failure to adjust for tobacco smoking. In addition, the duration from the onset of drug use to outcome (ie, lung cancer) may have been too short for lung cancer to develop because young participants were enrolled in most studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several reports have documented histologic and molecular changes in the bronchial epithelium of marijuana smokers that are similar to the metaplastic premalignant alterations that are seen among tobacco smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,30</a>]. Users of these drugs are probably at increased risk for lung cancer, although the magnitude of risk has not been well quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3265628397\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that heat liquid usually containing nicotine, producing a vapor that the user inhales. The effect of e-cigarettes on the incidence of lung cancer is not well established due to confounding effects of cigarette smoking among many patients who smoke e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are discussed in detail in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes#H28394420\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;, section on 'Smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21310564\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous occupational and environmental carcinogens increase the risk of lung cancer. The best known factors are asbestos and radon. Other exposures that have been associated with lung cancer include arsenic, bis-chloromethyl ether, chromium, formaldehyde, ionizing radiation, nickel, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hard metal dust, and vinyl chloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/33-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-42</a>]. Many of these factors act synergistically with tobacco smoke to produce lung cancer, and are also independent risk factors in nonsmokers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21310588\"><span class=\"h2\">Asbestos</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asbestos exposure is an established risk factor for lung cancer. Patients with asbestos exposure complicated by interstitial fibrosis (ie, asbestosis) are much more likely to develop lung cancer than patients with asbestos exposure alone.

The risk of lung cancer is dose-dependent but varies according to the type of asbestos fiber. For a given level of exposure, the risk appears to be considerably higher for workers exposed to amphibole fibers than for those exposed to chrysotile fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Tobacco smokers exposed to asbestos have a greatly increased risk of lung cancer, in addition to mesothelioma.

However, the potential risk is of great public health concern because of the large number of individuals who work or attend school in buildings that contain asbestos, and the cost and potential hazards of asbestos removal. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for low-level asbestos exposure are based upon linear extrapolation of data from occupational settings to nonoccupational airborne concentrations that are approximately 100,000-fold less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asbestos-related-pleuropulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One population study of women who resided in chrysotile mining towns in Quebec found that differences in estimated cumulative lifetime environmental asbestos exposure did not produce significant differences in the incidence of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The authors speculated that the EPA model may overestimate the dose-response relationship between low-level environmental asbestos exposure and lung cancer, although the study's negative findings might also relate to its potential overestimation of asbestos exposure, the fact that the mined asbestos was predominantly chrysotile, or because mined asbestos particles are larger and less respirable than refined asbestos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, an Italian study also failed to detect an increased risk of lung cancer among persons who resided near an asbestos cement factory in which refined asbestos was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21310964\"><span class=\"h2\">Radon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased concentrations of radon gas in the home are associated with a small, but statistically significant, increase in the risk of lung cancer.</p><p>Radon, a gaseous decay product of uranium-238 and radium-226, is capable of damaging respiratory epithelium via the emission of alpha particles.

This causal link is well established, and changes in smoking patterns (increased prevalence of smoking in women, decreased in men) have been correlated with changes in the epidemiology of lung cancer. Smoking cessation gradually reduces the risk of lung cancer, although not to baseline levels. Other forms of tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, are also associated with significant increases in the risk of lung cancer.
