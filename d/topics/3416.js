As discussed below, the degree of expected benefit is modest, and therapy should not be continued indefinitely in patients who do not appear to be benefiting or who have significant side effects. There is no convincing evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors are neuroprotective or have the ability to alter the underlying disease trajectory. (See <a href=\"#H3674201369\" class=\"local\">'Degree of benefit'</a> below and <a href=\"#H691890260\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Cholinesterase inhibitors are also suggested in most patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and may have comparatively greater symptomatic benefits than are observed in patients with AD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;, section on 'Cholinesterase inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>There is less consensus on the role of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with other forms of dementia, and regulatory approval is more variable for non-AD diagnoses. Most of the studies of cholinesterase inhibitors have been performed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD, and data are more limited and less consistent for other forms of dementia. Although AD is by far the most common cause of dementia in older adults, evidence of mixed pathology at the time of autopsy is common, especially the combination of Alzheimer and vascular pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

When assessed at 6 to 12 months, cholinesterase inhibitors led to modest improvements on the 70-point Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog; mean difference 2.7 points, 95% CI 2.3-3.0) and MMSE (mean difference 1.37 points, 95% CI 1.13-1.61) as well as global impression by caregivers and ADLs. One analysis estimated that these effects would be similar to preventing a two-months-per-year decline in a typical patient with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; another concluded that for every 12 patients treated, one would benefit by achieving minimal improvement or better and one would develop a treatment-related adverse effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Whether these drugs significantly improve long-term outcomes, such as the need for nursing home admission or maintaining critical ADLs, remains in doubt, and the evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/11,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19-23</a>].

The proportion of patients who developed significant weight loss (10 pounds or more over one year) was also significantly higher in treated patients (29 versus 23 percent). In a meta-analysis of nine placebo-controlled randomized trials with a median follow-up of five months, the risk of any weight loss was twofold higher in patients randomized to receive a cholinesterase inhibitor (6 versus 3 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.18, 95% CI 1.50-3.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In patients who are noted to be losing weight while on a cholinesterase inhibitor, we typically pursue nutritional counseling before stopping therapy and monitor the trend in weight over time. AD is often associated with anosmia, which detracts from taste. Enhancing the taste of food with spices, sweet and sour flavoring, or soy sauce can help with appetite.

We typically counsel patients and families to anticipate a six-month trial before making a decision about whether the medication is helping or not.</p><p>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is not specific enough for following response; we generally use a combination of naming, recall of a four-word list or story at 30 seconds and five minutes, and semantic fluency (eg, naming as many animals as possible in one minute). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) can be administered at each visit to track change over time.

Unless the medication is already at the lowest dose, it should be tapered by 50 percent for two to three weeks before stopping to minimize risk of worsening. An alternative cholinesterase inhibitor is not typically used in this setting unless a patient is unable to achieve a target dose on the initial chosen drug due to side effects or formulation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Memantine</a> can be added or substituted in patients with moderate to severe dementia. (See <a href=\"#H3798162770\" class=\"local\">'Role of memantine'</a> below.)</p><p>Others feel that it is not possible to determine which patients are responders based on initial response to medication and therefore suggest continuing medication as long as the patient agrees to it and tolerates it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Support for this approach is also drawn from a clinical trial of 295 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease (AD) who were already taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a>, which compared the efficacy of four treatment strategies: no therapy (donepezil discontinued), donepezil continued alone, donepezil continued with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a> added, and memantine therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. After one year, patients assigned to receive donepezil therapy had, on average, a higher score on the MMSE (1.9 points) and a better score on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS; 3.0 points) compared with those not receiving donepezil. The average differences in the MMSE score, but not the BADLS, met the prespecified threshold considered by the investigators to be clinically important. The trial was stopped early due to slow recruitment. A post hoc analysis suggested that discontinuation of donepezil might increase the risk of nursing home placement over the next 12 months, but not over the prespecified four-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1804037315\"><span class=\"h3\">Other reasons for discontinuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from lack of perceived benefit, other reasons for discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intolerable side effects despite dose reduction.
