Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority (approximately 85 percent) of lung cancers with the remainder as mostly small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Most patients present for diagnostic evaluation because of symptoms suspicious for lung cancer or an incidental finding on chest imaging. The goal of the initial evaluation is to obtain sufficient clinical and radiologic information to guide diagnostic tissue biopsy, staging, and treatment. </p><p>This review will provide a general overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer. Typically, the approach for those with suspected NSCLC is the same for those with suspected SCLC, although most of the data is derived from patients with suspected NSCLC. Thus, throughout the text of this topic the term NSCLC is frequently cited. The approach to a patient and modalities used for tissue biopsy and treatment of patients with NSCLC are reviewed elsewhere.

The general approach should be tailored to the individual values and preferences of the patient, the clinical presentation, as well as the technical expertise at the practicing institution.

However, some patients will require multiple imaging studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive procedures for tissue sampling. Although imaging and sampling procedures are often described separately, in practice, the pathways to diagnosis and staging are often synchronous. As an example, thoracentesis with cytology examination of fluid or transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy may provide both diagnosis and staging data.</p><p>No single diagnostic algorithm sufficiently addresses the complexity and variation in disease patterns of lung cancer. The local expertise and resources, as well as institution and health system factors, may influence the approach taken. Multi-disciplinary teams may help facilitate an investigative plan so that therapy can be implemented in a timely fashion. The selection of a biopsy modality, the role of multidisciplinary teams, and the procedures used to obtain tissue are discussed in detail separately.

Most patients can be investigated in an outpatient setting. However, patient factors including comorbidities (eg, respiratory failure, hemoptysis, debilitating metastases to the brain or bone) may lead clinicians to conduct the work-up in a hospital setting. Expedient diagnosis is especially important when there is concern for small cell carcinoma, such as in patients with large, central tumors or evidence of bulky mediastinal disease. (See <a href=\"#H4893832\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>While some observational series show improved time to therapy with system-driven interventions (eg, multidisciplinary clinic and tumor board, healthcare and hospital associated rapid investigation systems), few studies report improved patient-relevant outcomes due to the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. We prefer that patients with tolerable symptoms and no evidence of complications complete the initial evaluation within six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While most cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are slow growing with a typical doubling time of 90 to 180 days, some cases are rapidly growing and can progress during the evaluation period. One case series reported disease progression in 13, 31, and 46 percent of patients at 4, 8, and 16 weeks, respectively, with distant metastasis newly evident in 3, 13, and 13 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) can present with similar symptoms, and few clinical features reliably distinguish them from each other. Features that suggest SCLC include rapidly progressive symptoms and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone), bulky multi-station mediastinal metastasis, superior vena cava syndrome, and bone and brain metastases. In contrast, Pancoast's syndrome and hypercalcemia are more frequently encountered in patients with NSCLC. </p><p>The spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms including paraneoplastic syndromes that can be seen in patients with lung cancer are discussed in detail separately.

Patients with symptoms suggestive of primary or metastatic lung cancer should undergo initial imaging with chest radiograph. Every attempt should be made to obtain and review any prior chest imaging studies to determine the age and growth pattern of identified abnormalities. Solid-appearing lesions on chest computed tomography (CT) that are stable in size for at least two years are highly unlikely to represent lung carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Malignant non-solid and part-solid nodules often grow more slowly, so a longer period of stability is needed to exclude malignancy.

Small lymph nodes can harbor occult malignancy and some lesions that are not highly fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid are malignant.

The prevalence of granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis in the local patient population is an important factor in interpretation of PET results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Consequently, with the possible exception of bulky and confluent mediastinal disease (group A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93837 \">table 4</a>)), the identification of suspicious mediastinal metastases by CT or PET does not bypass the need for histologic assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes for accurate staging and exclusion of alternative diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Thus, the major use of CT and PET as staging tools is to facilitate the optimal approach to biopsy so that patients can be accurately staged histologically and futile surgery avoided. The accuracy of CT and PET and the approach to tissue biopsy are discussed separately.

Because of the higher prevalence of occult brain metastasis in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC, some experts believe that routine brain imaging is warranted, although there is little evidence that early detection and treatment of occult metastasis improves outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Brain CT scan should be used when MRI is not available. The poor sensitivity of PET for brain metastases limits this modality in the detection of brain NSCLC. (See <a href=\"#H990064\" class=\"local\">'Imaging metastatic disease'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108294779\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan of the chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every patient with suspected lung cancer should undergo CT scan of the chest. Intravenous (IV) contrast enhancement is preferable as it may distinguish mediastinal invasion of the primary tumor or metastatic lymph nodes from vascular structures. Images of the liver and adrenal glands should also be included. In most patients, CT scan assesses the anatomic location and size of the tumor (T), nodal (N), and metastatic disease of the pleura, liver, and adrenal glands (M). With the possible exception of those with bulky mediastinal tumor (group A, see below), most patients with mediastinal node involvement by CT will need tissue biopsy of the mediastinum (ie, mediastinal staging) to confirm suspected mediastinal nodal disease. The role of CT in the evaluation and staging of patients suspected to have NSCLC is discussed here. The value of CT in the evaluation of a solitary pulmonary nodule is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomographic-and-positron-emission-tomographic-scanning-of-pulmonary-nodules#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scanning of pulmonary nodules&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography (CT)'</a>.)</p><p>The major advantage of CT is that it provides accurate anatomic definition of the tumor within the thorax, which consequently directs tissue biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis and staging. For example, CT frequently permits the accurate identification of T3 or T4 lesions (ie, larger tumors that invade surrounding bony or mediastinal structures) and identifies high-yield targets for biopsy including N1-3 lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>). CT also identifies tumor-related atelectasis or post-obstructive pneumonitis (T2 disease) and intra-thoracic and extra-thoracic metastatic disease that can prompt additional testing (eg, MRI for brachial plexus or bone involvement), as well as co-existing lung disease (eg, emphysema) that may affect biopsy choice or operability.

As an example, patients in group A are not candidates for surgical treatment. The focus of biopsy in this setting is on diagnosis of the tumor by the safest method and imaging may be used as the staging modality. In contrast, for all patients with discrete suspicious lymphadenopathy (group B), invasive sampling of the mediastinum and in particular, the targeted node, is critical for accurate staging. The selection of modality based upon the radiographic findings described above (A through D) and disease stage is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H205761912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Approach to the patient'</a>.)</p><p>The major limitation of CT is its low accuracy in the identification of mediastinal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. A 2013 systematic review of 43 studies reported the accuracy of CT as a mediastinal staging tool in 7368 patients with suspected NSCLC, where a positive scan was defined as lymph nodes measuring &gt;1 cm in short scanning diameter (prevalence of mediastinal metastasis was 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CT predicted mediastinal lymph node involvement with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 55, 81, 58, and 83 percent, respectively. Thus, due to its low sensitivity and specificity, CT scanning is not a reliable modality for accurately staging the mediastinum in patients with NSCLC. With the exception of bulky mediastinal disease, this necessitates tissue sampling in most cases to confirm suspected regional lymph node involvement.

Although whole-body PET is more accurate than CT in detecting occult disease, its use has not been shown to improve survival, and the evidence is conflicting on whether PET can reduce the risk of futile thoracotomy. Thus, the use of PET as a staging modality should be considered in the context of the risk of missing occult disease, patient preferences, and local expertise. We prefer the selective use of PET in potentially resectable patients with T2 or T3 lesions by CT stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) to detect occult metastases, or those at high risk of surgical complications. When a PET scan is positive, with the exception of those with bulky mediastinal tumor (group A), it does not obviate the need for tissue biopsy to confirm suspected disease. The value of PET in mediastinal staging is discussed here. The role of PET in the evaluation of a solitary pulmonary nodule and in the evaluation of distant metastases associated with NSCLC is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H429499879\" class=\"local\">'Modality'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H1486138141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Positron emission tomography/computed tomography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=computed-tomographic-and-positron-emission-tomographic-scanning-of-pulmonary-nodules#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scanning of pulmonary nodules&quot;, section on 'Positron emission tomography (PET)'</a>.) </p><p>PET scanning has limited anatomic resolution but does provide information on the metabolic activity of the primary tumor, mediastinal involvement, and potential distant metastases. There are no standardized criteria defining what constitutes a positive PET result and no ideal cut-off point for the standardized uptake value (SUV). However, lymph nodes with FDG uptake greater than that observed in the mediastinal blood pool are highly suspicious for metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>PET is more accurate in the evaluation of mediastinal disease (N) when compared to contrast-enhanced chest CT and sometimes detects occult disease (eg, liver, adrenal, bone, and pleural metastases) outside the thoracic cavity (M) that is not radiologically evident by CT scanning. With respect to mediastinal staging by PET, one systematic review of 45 studies which included 4105 patients reported sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values of 80, 88, 75, and 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another meta-analysis of 39 studies reported increased sensitivity of PET (100 percent) when lymph nodes were also enlarged (&gt;1 cm) on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The rationale for the use of PET in operable patients with potentially resectable cancers is derived from randomized trials that included patients with radiographic (CT)<strong> stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC</strong> (per The 7<sup>th</sup> edition of the TNM system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80099 \">table 5</a>)) that suggest a reduction in futile thoracotomy when PET is performed. However, trials evaluating the association between PET scanning and therapeutic outcome in this population have had conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/20-22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22,27,28</a>]. While two studies suggest a reduction in the rate of futile thoracotomies with the use of PET as a staging modality in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>], three studies suggest no difference in the same population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/21,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27,28</a>]. This conflict may be explained by the heterogeneity in scanning modality and population studied (high risk versus low risk metastatic disease). Our approach prioritizes the avoidance of unnecessary surgery. &#160;</p><p>The value of PET in radiographic<strong> stage IA1-3 (T1a-cN0M0)</strong> NSCLC is also controversial. In this population, the estimated prevalence of metastatic disease is very low (approximately 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Some argue that PET is unnecessary in this situation and proceed directly to either cervical mediastinoscopy or surgical resection of the primary tumor with mediastinal sampling at the time of surgery, while others believe that when used in this context, PET can further reduce the risk of unnecessary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/26,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29-33</a>]. While we favor surgical resection with mediastinal sampling, it is also reasonable to perform PET scanning pre-operatively in those at high surgical risk. Importantly, patients and clinicians must be aware that limiting preoperative staging to imaging alone without biopsy of radiographically positive lymph nodes sampling carries a risk of a false positive result that may result in a missed opportunity for surgical cure. </p><p>When staging the mediastinum, errors associated with PET that should be considered are the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-positron-emission-tomography#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic positron emission tomography&quot;, section on 'Sources of error'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False positives can occur with benign FDG-avid lesions such as infections, inflammation, and granulomatous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False negatives typically occur when there are microscopic foci of metastasis, and in non-enlarged lymph nodes (&lt;10 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. As an example, although PET can be positive in small lesions, the detection of occult malignancy in normal sized lymph nodes for early stage cancer is lower than for enlarged nodes. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H375614\"><span class=\"h3\">Integrated PET/CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite its widespread use, there is no consensus regarding the routine use of integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> as a staging modality for patients with suspected NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although randomized trials suggest that the use of integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> reduced futile thoracotomies, and is probably superior to either modality alone, it has not been shown to improve survival. We prefer the routine use of CT together with the targeted use of dedicated PET OR <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in patients with suspected NSCLC. In general, the indications for <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> are the same as for dedicated PET. In many centers, only <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is available, in which case it is the de facto test of choice. As is true for dedicated PET, a suspicious finding for metastases on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> should always prompt biopsy for histologic confirmation.

For example if metabolic activity is seen in the region of the mediastinum, its relation to vascular, hilar or endobronchial structures is unknown. The addition of coregistered CT to PET scanning adds correlative anatomic information, thereby combining the advantages of both imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Although the sensitivity was lower than that reported in meta-analyses of CT or PET alone, it is not plausible that addition of information obtained from either modality would reduce sensitivity.

Both modalities have been shown in small prospective observational studies to result in the avoidance of unnecessary thoracotomy in patients with solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/41,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48-50</a>].

The optimal timing for repeat imaging is not standardized and should be tailored to the individual patient. For example, patients with early stage disease who develop new onset headache or bone pain do require modification of the original evaluation plan to investigate those symptoms. A critical objective in the staging evaluation is timeliness. However, re-imaging is reasonable in select circumstances prior to biopsy when unavoidable, prolonged delays occur (eg, rapidly progressive disease or new symptoms) if there is a delay by eight weeks or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].

When evaluating patients for brain metastases, gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain is usually preferred because it is more sensitive than non-enhanced MRI or CT. When PET, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> or MRI is not available, conventional staging with abdominal CT, bone scintigraphy, and CT scan of the brain should be performed when indicated. The detection of occult metastases by any of these modalities is not associated with a proven survival benefit, although it is desirable to prevent an unnecessary surgical procedure. With the exception of brain, histologic confirmation of suspected metastatic disease by any of these modalities is indicated, unless there is convincing evidence of widespread metastasis by noninvasive imaging.

Although subgroup analysis in observational case series suggest that PET may be superior to CT for the detection of liver metastases, false positive and false negative findings were also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/67,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,80</a>]. In the absence of overwhelming evidence of systemic metastasis such as multiple other sites with imaging consistent with tumor metastasis, isolated hepatic lesions require careful evaluation and biopsy to achieve accurate staging. Isolated PET-positive liver lesions in an otherwise early-stage patient should not be used as the basis for determination of metastatic tumor stage without confirmatory biopsy.

Two studies of 158 patients with biopsy-proven bony metastases from NSCLC reported that, compared to bone scintigraphy, PET scanning had similar sensitivity (93 percent) but greater specificity (93 to 96 versus 66 to 73 percent) for the detection of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].

The known caveat of bone scintigraphy is that the false positive rate is high due to the common prevalence of degenerative and traumatic skeletal disease in the general population. One meta-analysis of eight studies suggested that, compared to PET, bone scintigraphy has a comparable negative predictive value of &gt;90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MRI has comparable accuracy to bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of bony metastases.

For example, apical lesions that invade through the chest wall can involve the shoulder as well as the brachial plexus, and lesions of the posterior mediastinum can involve the vertebra and spinal canal. In these settings, MRI can be used in conjunction with other imaging modalities to distinguish true bony metastases from T3 lesions that are potentially resectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleura </strong>&ndash; Two common clinical presentations of pleural disease are: metastases associated with pleural effusion or multiple pleural-based nodules, and direct extension of the primary tumor to the pleura or chest wall. Complete evaluation of pleural disease may require multiple imaging modalities (PET, CT, ultrasound, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI) as well as invasive testing (thoracentesis, thoracoscopy, or pleural biopsy). While imaging is important in the detection of suspected pleural metastases, it should not obviate the need to sample the pleural disease for histological confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H1550887\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Suspected pleural metastases'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-plaques-thickening-and-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural plaques, thickening, and tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Careful review of CT imaging is particularly important in the evaluation of tumors with direct extension into extrapleural fat, visceral pleura, or parietal pleura. Such lesions are operable and need to be distinguished from metastatic disease of the pleural space (M1a) which is inoperable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. When imaging is insufficient to make this distinction, direct vision at the time of thoracotomy may be required. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retrospective studies have shown PET to be an accurate modality in the detection of pleural metastases from NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. In one retrospective study of patients with an established diagnosis of NSCLC, the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of PET for detecting pleural metastases was 95, 67, and 92 percent. However, the prevalence of pleural metastases in this study may have falsely lowered the negative predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. PET imaging, in another study, correctly detected the presence of malignant pleural involvement in 16 of 18 patients with NSCLC and more importantly excluded a malignant effusion in 16 of 17 patients with a sensitivity and accuracy of 88 and 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. PET is not useful in examining the extent of invasion across tissues planes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT is important for the anatomic delineation of tumor involvement of all components of the pleural space, extrapleural fat, visceral and parietal pleura. Apart from obvious pleural masses, thickening and effusions, subtle beading, and pleural puckering visible on CT are also highly suspicious for pleural metastases. The detection of metastatic pleural involvement by CT has been shown to have important implications for prognosis of patients with NSCLC. As an example, in one retrospective study of 98 patients with NSCLC, compared to wet pleural dissemination (pleural fluid), dry pleural dissemination (nodularity without pleural fluid) was associated with better median survival (38 versus 13 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasound can also be used to evaluate the pleural space. In a small prospective case series, when distinguishing benign from malignant disease, the sensitivity of ultrasound was comparable to CT at 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Pleural thickening &gt;1 cm, pleural nodularity, and diaphragmatic thickening &gt;7 mm were highly suggestive of malignant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MRI may be useful when evaluating the extent of tumor invasion through muscle, nerve, and bone but has not been formally studied as a staging tool pleural involvement in NSCLC.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98206806\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of lung cancer should not be made without definitive pathology.

Most data are derived from studies of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although not absolute, for patients with higher disease stage, minimally invasive modalities (eg, endoscopic procedures) are typically preferred over more invasive modalities (eg, video-assisted thoracic surgery and mediastinoscopy) for the initial biopsy. Conversely, for patients with peripheral early stage disease, surgical biopsy is sometimes preferred because diagnosis and curative resection may be achieved simultaneously.

Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-directed biopsy has emerged as the most common modality used for diagnosis and staging of suspected NSCLC due to its high diagnostic accuracy for accessing central primary tumors and most mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, EBUS-directed biopsy in patients with mediastinal adenopathy on computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed quickly and reduce the time to establishing of treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. If initial tissue sampling provides inconclusive results or is insufficient for essential immunohistochemical or molecular characterization, a second biopsy procedure is required. The selection of a second biopsy procedure should favor modalities with a higher tissue volume (eg, surgical sampling). The selection of modality and procedures used for tissue biopsy of NSCLC are discussed separately. Although genetic and molecular microarray techniques of both tissue and peripheral blood have been studied as potential diagnostic tools designed to enhance the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of lung cancer, further study is required before they can be recommended for routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

Biopsy is required to distinguish NSCLC from other cancers or benign lesions of the lung. Among the malignant etiologies, the major entity that needs to be distinguished from NSCLC is SCLC. This distinction is critical because the prognosis and treatment for NSCLC and SCLC are different. Although not always present, there are a number of clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features that can help the clinician make this distinction.</p><p>The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic manifestations that may help to distinguish NSCLC from SCLC are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid presentation</strong> &ndash; Although the common symptoms of lung cancer, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain, can be encountered in both NSCLC and SCLC, a more rapid presentation over weeks favors SCLC. This may be due to the higher doubling time associated with SCLC. As an example, a rapidly growing lesion on chest imaging (eg, a mass that grows over three to six weeks) is more suggestive of SCLC rather than NSCLC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancoast's syndrome</strong> &ndash; Benign and malignant lesions of the superior sulcus (ie, the thoracic inlet at the apex of the lung) can cause Pancoast's syndrome. Pancoast's syndrome is a constellation of one or more clinical signs (eg, weakness and atrophy of the muscles of the hand <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ipsilateral ptosis, anhidrosis, and miosis [Horner's syndrome]) that are due to compression or involvement of the brachial plexus (nerves and vessel) and the cervical sympathetic nerves. Unlike superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, Pancoast's syndrome is overwhelmingly more common in NSCLC and rarely due to SCLC or a benign lesion. Imaging findings of apical masses that have malignant features should always prompt additional evaluation and biopsy for NSCLC involvement of the thoracic outlet.

Typically, the cells in SCLC are roughly twice the size of lymphocytes when subjectively assessed on light microscopy. Additional features that distinguish SCLC from NSCLC include hyperchromatic appearance, small amounts of cytoplasm (ie, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio), cohesive sheets of small &quot;blue&quot; cells with rosette formation, crush artifact with necrosis, and cell fragility. When classic features of SCLC are present, morphologic criteria alone are often diagnostic and support high interobserver reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. In contrast, the classic features of epithelial differentiation (eg, keratin pearls [squamous], gland formation [adenocarcinoma]) do not support the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma but are highly suggestive for non-small cell carcinoma.

SCLC can be positive for TTF-1. However, as a neuroendocrine tumor, SCLC should have no other shared IHC staining patterns with NSCLC and is typically positive for synaptophysin, CD56, chromogranin, or neuron specific enolase (NSE), while NSCLC is negative for these stains. The immunohistochemical characteristics of NSCLC are discussed separately.

NSCLC is a heterogeneous group of tumors (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma) that together account for the majority of lung cancers. The goal of the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected NSCLC is to obtain sufficient clinical and radiologic information to proceed with diagnostic tissue biopsy, staging, and treatment in a timely fashion. A second major goal of the initial evaluation is to identify patient values and preferences that will determine the context and choices for care. (See <a href=\"#H763306\" class=\"local\">'General goals and timing of evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common clinical manifestations of NSCLC at presentation are cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Asymptomatic patients may come to clinical attention during screening or following the incidental detection of imaging abnormalities. Symptoms, when present, often represent advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H57205858\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H98205022\" class=\"local\">'Initial imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical evaluation should be symptom-directed. This approach relies upon the clinician maintaining a high index of suspicion for nodal or metastatic disease, which in turn allows appropriate imaging and invasive testing to confirm nodal or metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H13686798\" class=\"local\">'Clinical'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4894033\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every patient with suspected NSCLC should undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and upper abdomen (usually contrast-enhanced) to evaluate the extent of the primary tumor and potential spread to the mediastinum, liver, and adrenal glands. Radiographic staging does not obviate the need for tissue biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H108294779\" class=\"local\">'CT scan of the chest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not perform positron emission tomographic scanning (PET) or integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in every patient with suspected NSCLC. For patients who have no symptoms or findings of metastatic disease and who also may be resection candidates, the role of preoperative PET or integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> remains controversial. We prefer selective PET or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in patients who are resection candidates with larger primary lesions (eg, T2 or T3 by CT scan), or in those at high risk for surgical complications; in such cases the use of PET may reduce the incidence of futile thoracotomies, although false positive results are common and these require biopsy confirmation preoperatively. PET imaging in patients with clinical stage IA (T1N0M0) disease prior to curative surgery is also controversial; while we favor surgical resection with mediastinal sampling in this population, preoperative PET scanning in those at high surgical risk is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H375260\" class=\"local\">'Whole body PET'</a> above and <a href=\"#H375614\" class=\"local\">'Integrated PET/CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine imaging to screen for distant metastases is not required for every case of suspected NSCLC. Imaging for metastatic disease should be symptom-focused or CT-directed. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is used to evaluate symptomatic patients for brain metastases and to assess asymptomatic patients with clinical stage III or IV NSCLC. (See <a href=\"#H990064\" class=\"local\">'Imaging metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of NSCLC is made based upon the pathologic evaluation of cytologic (eg, pleural fluid) or histopathologic (eg, tissue biopsy) specimens. The initial radiographic staging optimizes the selection of a biopsy site and preferred modality to obtain a pathologic sample. Consideration should be given to obtaining a large enough sample to allow supplemental immunohistochemical and genetic analysis.
