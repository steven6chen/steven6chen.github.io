The clinical manifestations of RP include night blindness, loss of peripheral vision from progressive loss of photoreceptors, and variably loss of central vision due to cataracts and macular edema.</p><p>Although there is no cure for RP, treatments are available for managing some aspects of its clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. New treatments involving gene therapy, transplantation, and implanted electrical devices, are in active development.</p><p>This topic addresses available treatment options as well as review therapeutic strategies that remain experimental. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinitis-pigmentosa-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinitis pigmentosa: Clinical presentation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin and nutritional supplementation therapy is beneficial only for a limited group of patients with some forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Several new treatments are on the horizon to slow or possibly even reverse the retinal degeneration caused by photoreceptor loss. These treatments include gene therapy and retinal cell transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin and nutritional supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for vitamin therapy in RP was originally suggested by an observational study in which patients with RP who were taking vitamins A and E appeared to have slower decline in electroretinography (ERG) measurements than those not taking vitamin supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Dietary modification is the definitive therapy for three rare forms of retinitis pigmentosa:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) &ndash; Abetalipoproteinemia is a genetic disorder that causes defective intestinal absorption of lipids, including fat soluble vitamins. Ophthalmologic and neurologic manifestations of abetalipoproteinemia include RP, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and, in up to one-third of patients, intellectual and developmental disabilities. Treatment with fat soluble vitamins (E, A, and K) can modify manifestations of the disease. In early stages of disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> and E supplementation may restore retinal function, improving dark adaptation and reversing ERG abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroacanthocytosis#H1983214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroacanthocytosis&quot;, section on 'Abetalipoproteinemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phytanic acid oxidase deficiency (Refsum disease) &ndash; Refsum disease is the result of a genetic abnormality in which the enzyme that breaks down phytanic acid is absent. Patients develop RP, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral polyneuropathy. Severely reducing intake of foods containing phytanic acid, such as dairy products, certain types of meat, and seafood, can slow or stop progression of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'Refsum disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-tocopherol transport protein deficiency (ataxia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> deficiency) &ndash; Alpha-tocopherol transport protein deficiency is a hereditary syndrome with RP, ataxia, and vitamin E deficiency. Treatment with vitamin E may halt progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hereditary ataxias&quot;, section on 'Treatable diseases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> in the treatment for RP, outside of its well-established indication in patients with abetalipoproteinemia, remains controversial. It is unclear if small potential benefits of vitamin A supplementation outweigh the potential risks. Therefore, we do not recommend high-dose vitamin A for patients with RP.</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial, 601 patients aged 18 to 49 years with RP (including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked non-syndromic and Usher syndrome) were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (15,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day);</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> (400 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day);</span> both vitamin A and E at these doses; or trace amounts of vitamin A and E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cone ERG amplitudes were measured. At four- to six-year follow-up, patients taking supplemental vitamin A had a slightly lower rate of decline of ERG amplitudes. Results suggested that vitamin E had a negative impact, accelerating the decline of ERG amplitudes in a subset of patients with the highest initial cone ERG results. No significant effect on visual field or visual acuity was noted for either vitamin supplement. There are several limitations in drawing conclusions about the beneficial effects of vitamin A. Positive response to treatment was seen only on the ERG, and no effect was seen on clinically relevant measures of visual function.</p><p>There is a theoretical risk of toxicity from long-term high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>. The toxic effects of high-dose vitamin A include hepatomegaly, bone changes such as osteoporosis, elevated blood lipid levels, increased intracranial pressure, and teratogenicity. Although the daily intake of the dose of vitamin A palmitate suggested as treatment for RP (15,000 international units, equivalent to three times the daily allowance) was not shown to be harmful in adults in this study, there are no well-controlled studies on the effect of vitamin A at this dose when taken longer term, such as over decades. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-a\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin A&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While we do not recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> supplementation for RP, we do suggest that adults with early to middle stages of RP avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> supplements. Patients who have been advised to take vitamin A should have annual fasting vitamin A levels and liver function tests; older patients should be monitored for osteoporosis. High-dose vitamin A supplementation is contraindicated during pregnancy or for those planning to become pregnant, due to teratogenicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Omega-3 fatty acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found naturally in fish, is a major structural lipid of retinal photoreceptor outer segment membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and may be involved in rhodopsin regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The long-term effectiveness of DHA on the progression of RP is uncertain. Although observational studies have shown possible benefit of a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, no benefit of DHA supplementation was demonstrated in randomized trials. We suggest that patients with RP consume a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, but we do not suggest that patients take supplemental DHA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An observational study of patients with RP who were participating in randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> found a 40 percent slower rate of annual decline in distance visual acuity for those whose food questionnaire indicated a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids (&gt;0.20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A 2006 systematic review of six studies, not all randomized, found trends suggesting improved outcomes with use of omega-3 fatty acid supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In subgroup analyses from two of the included randomized trials, subjects with the highest red blood cell concentrations of DHA (combining patients who received supplements as well as controls who had diets high in fish oils) had the slowest rates of retinal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Another 2013 systematic review involving three randomized trials (one of vitamin A alone, one of DHA alone, and one comparing DHA plus vitamin A with vitamin A alone) found no effect on the progression of visual field or visual acuity loss, although an effect on ERG amplitudes was demonstrated in some subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial in patients with X-linked RP found that long term DHA supplementation did not slow loss of cone or rod ERG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Further study is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several emerging technologies, including gene therapy, retinal cell transplantation, and retinal prosthesis devices, may provide additional therapeutic options for patients with RP. One of these, gene therapy, has been shown to be effective for Leber congenital amaurosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Remarkable progress has led to the identification of many genes involved in RP. These discoveries have spearheaded research into gene therapies. Where genetic defects lead to the loss of an encoded protein, gene-replacement therapy could potentially induce production of the missing protein. Timing of gene replacement in the progression of RP may be critical, as viable photoreceptor cells must still be present in enough numbers to respond to the missing protein and restore visual function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1930150619\"><span class=\"h4\">Leber congenital amaurosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/204000&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFRq9f0MGN2Oxgakbp76u2bHMo4U38/JXV/gPFEkV/GDX&amp;TOPIC_ID=6911\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Leber congenital amaurosis</a> (LCA) is a form of RP present at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some patients with LCA have a mutation in <em>RPE65</em> that prevents the production of 11-cis retinal, an essential photopigment. Phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrated the safety of gene transfer by subretinal injection using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) combined with the <em>RPE65</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23</a>]. In a phase 3 randomized controlled trial in 31 patients aged &ge;3 years with LCA, bilateral subretinal delivery of voretigene neparvovec (AAV2 vector) improved their ability to navigate independently in low to moderate light conditions compared with controls at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nearly all treated patients showed improved light sensitivity, visual fields, and functional vision under dim lighting conditions. These initial studies of gene therapy for LCA are very encouraging, but it still needs to be determined whether the beneficial effects will be durable. The therapy has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for biallelic <em>RPE65</em> mutation-associated retinal dystrophy and represents the first gene therapy approved by the FDA for an inherited disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>A phase 1 trial assessing targeted therapy with synthetic replacement of the 11-cis retinal photopigment has shown promising results in patients with LCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential for transplanted retinas, retinal sheets, and clumps of retinal neurons to restore vision in mice and humans with RP has been under investigation since the 1980s. Until recently, transplanted tissue or cells have not developed synaptic connections with host cells and thus have not had functional impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>The potential for transplantation of fetal retinal pigment epithelium to rescue abnormal photoreceptors in RP is being investigated. After fetal retinal implantation into six patients with RP, slight improvement in visual acuity was seen in three patients (one patient with bilateral improvement including the eye that did not receive the transplant) although the extent of improvement was not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Integration of donor cells into the host retina is dependent upon the stage of cell differentiation at the time of donor harvest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Successful integration of committed fetal progenitor cells that developed into functional rod photoreceptors was demonstrated in a mouse model of RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Transplanted cells did not integrate into the retina in mice with more active disease and more rapid retinal degeneration.</p><p>Regulatory and ethical issues with use of human fetal retinal cells has led to exploration of human embryonic stem cells that might be induced to differentiate into photoreceptor progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Such stem cells may also produce factors that enhance survival of host photoreceptors, as demonstrated in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In addition, mouse embryonic stem cells can be used to create a complex three-dimensional array of retinal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>A human clinical trial, the Safety Study in Retinal Transplantation for Retinitis Pigmentosa, has completed enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Its long-term goal is to determine if transplantation can prevent blindness or restore eyesight in patients with RP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal prosthesis devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Devices are being tested that transduce light into electrical signals and transmit this information directly to the inner retina (bypassing the diseased outer retina of RP), optic nerve, or occipital visual cortex. Patients involved in studies of these devices have reported seeing flashes of light and have been able to sense motion, locate large objects, and recognize large letters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. There are multiple retinal prostheses in clinical trials.</p><p>One retinal prosthesis system (Argus II) converts video images captured from a very small camera housed in the patient&rsquo;s glasses into a series of small electrical impulses that are wirelessly transmitted to an array of 60 electrodes on the retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Vision restoration is theoretically correlated with the number of electrodes. Newer generations of prostheses have increasingly more electrodes, with one in the development phase with over 1000 electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Retinal prostheses have the potential to enhance the quality of life of RP patients by aiding in object recognition, mobility, and independent living.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of macular edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoid macular edema can reduce central vision in later stages of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The most successful treatment thus far is the oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>. Acetazolamide increases fluid absorption across the retinal pigment epithelium. In the absence of macular edema, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors do not improve vision or alter the course of electroretinography (ERG) degradation in patients with RP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In a small crossover trial, 10 of 12 patients with RP and chronic macular edema demonstrated objective and subjective improvement in visual acuity when treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinitis-pigmentosa-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
