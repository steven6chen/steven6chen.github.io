A nose fracture is when a person breaks a bone in the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62443 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different kinds of nose fractures, depending on how the bone breaks. Some fractures are more serious than others. If the bone is only cracked, the fracture is usually not as serious. But if a bone is pushed out of position, the fracture is more serious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362737\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a nose fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a nose fracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing through the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the nose or clear fluid draining from the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to smell</p><p/><p>A nose fracture can also make the nose look crooked or bent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362752\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my nose is bleeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your nose is bleeding, you can follow these steps to help stop the bleeding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bend forward a little at the waist when you sit or stand. Do NOT lie down or tilt your head back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Firmly pinch together the soft area towards the bottom of your nose, below the bone, using your thumb and finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62213\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62213 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on your nose for a few minutes at a time. Try to put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p>If the bleeding continues, you can gently put some gauze or a cotton ball in your nose. But if you can't get the bleeding to stop, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362767\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people need tests. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your injury and symptoms, and do an exam. Depending on your injury and symptoms, he or she might do an X-ray or CT scan. A CT scan is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p><strong>How are nose fractures treated?</strong> &ndash; For the first 1 to 2 days after your injury, you can help reduce swelling by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your head above the level of your heart (and not lying down flat)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your nose &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. You should put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. You should use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p>If you have a lot of pain or a severe fracture, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If you have a mild fracture, he or she will recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>Other treatment depends on how mild or severe your nose fracture is. If your nose bones are in the correct position and you can breathe through both nostrils, your nose fracture is mild. You probably won't need other treatment. But your doctor might want to check your nose again after the swelling has gotten better.</p><p>If you have a collection of blood in your nose, the doctor will drain the blood. Then he or she will put &quot;packing material&quot; in your nose for a few days to stop the bleeding.</p><p>If your injury pushed your nose bones out of position, the bones will need to be put back in the correct position. Doctors can sometimes put the nose bones back in the correct position by doing a procedure.</p><p>But if this procedure doesn't work, or you have a severe nose fracture, you will need surgery. Nose surgery is usually done by a specialist called an ear, nose, and throat doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362782\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do nose fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nose fractures take weeks to heal. The healing time depends on how mild or severe the fracture is.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362797\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your nose fracture is healing. For example, he or she might recommend that you avoid doing certain activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362812\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your nose is bleeding a lot, or clear fluid is leaking from your nose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are having trouble breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362827\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-and-facial-fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skull and facial fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nosebleeds-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nosebleeds (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nosebleeds-epistaxis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nosebleeds (epistaxis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
