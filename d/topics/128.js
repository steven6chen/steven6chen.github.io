Acetaminophen poisoning can cause serious, long-lasting problems. It can even lead to death.</p><p>Unfortunately, people often overdose (take too much <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>) by accident. That happens, in part, because hundreds of nonprescription medicines have acetaminophen in them. When people take 2 or more of these medicines, they do not always realize that they are taking more acetaminophen than they should take. Acetaminophen poisoning can also happen when children get access to medicine and take too much. In some cases, people take too much acetaminophen on purpose, because they want to kill themselves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29501021\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acetaminophen poisoning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms after an overdose. In people who do have symptoms, the symptoms follow a pattern based on how long it has been since the overdose.</p><p>Within the first 24 hours after overdose, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paleness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired and sick</p><p/><p>On days 2 and 3, the symptoms from the first day often go away, but that does not mean the person is fine. During this time, the liver or kidneys can stop working correctly. Symptoms during this stage can include belly pain and not urinating as much as normal.</p><p>After day 3, the symptoms from the first day can come back. The person can also become confused and develop jaundice, a condition in which the skin and the whites of the eyes turn yellow. When poisoning is severe, people can die during this stage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29501036\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for acetaminophen poisoning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the doctor or nurse suspects <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning, he or she can order a blood test to check the level of acetaminophen in the blood. He or she will probably also order blood tests to check how the liver and kidneys are working. That's because acetaminophen poisoning can damage the liver and kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29501051\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think you or your child took too much <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>, call the Poison Control Center in the US at 1-800-222-1222. See a doctor or nurse (or go to the emergency room) if the poison control center tells you to do so. If possible, be prepared to tell the doctor or nurse exactly which medicines you or your child took, how much of each medicine, and when. You can even bring the medicines to the doctor in a bag, so he or she can look at all the ingredients.</p><p>People living outside the US can find information about poison control centers at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17049\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29501066\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acetaminophen poisoning treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N-acetylcysteine, also called &quot;NAC&quot; &ndash; NAC is a medicine that can keep <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> from doing harm to the body. It is an &quot;antidote.&quot; It works best if it is given soon after an overdose (within 8 hours).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activated charcoal &ndash; This is a medicine that binds to any <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> that is still in the stomach or intestines. This keeps the body from absorbing it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver transplant &ndash; This is when a doctor replaces a person's damaged liver with a healthy one. People who have too much liver damage as a result of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning sometimes need a new liver.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29501081\"><span class=\"h1\">Can acetaminophen poisoning be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes.
