The most common hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are relatively straightforward to diagnose. However, there are thousands of other genetic abnormalities in the globin genes, the majority of which are clinically silent; for many of these, characterizing the abnormality and its clinical implications is more challenging. It is important to identify clinically significant hemoglobinopathies causing SCD and thalassemia to inform optimal management in affected individuals and to offer genetic counseling and reproductive options in carriers.</p><p>This topic reviews methods for hemoglobinopathy testing and their appropriate use.

Throughout life, the synthesis of the alpha-like chains and the non-alpha-like (also called beta-like) chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

They may affect one or more of the alpha-like globin chains, the non-alpha-like (eg, beta, gamma) globin chains, or both. Most of the clinically important hemoglobinopathies involve missense mutations in the coding sequence of a globin gene (single nucleotide substitutions that alter the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein). Deletions, insertions, and gene fusions have also been reported, as have alterations in the non-coding (regulatory) regions of the gene, which may affect splicing or <span class=\"nowrap\">transcription/expression</span> levels. Over a thousand such defects have been described; a listing is available on the <a href=\"http://globin.cse.psu.edu/&amp;token=W/MNZorEFI2EtNnE4Oqza+LSzyNbNNPsEL85T2QwNbbfeKuzf3vos5FVncGUXy64&amp;TOPIC_ID=13941\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Globin Gene Server</a>. Some of the specific defects are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemoglobinopathies can be broadly classified into hemoglobin variants (qualitative defects), in which the genetic defect gives rise to a structural change in the Hb molecule; and thalassemias (quantitative defects), in which the genetic defect leads to a quantitative change in the amount of that globin chain produced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65311 \">figure 3</a>). Typically, Hb variants and alpha thalassemia are characterized by hemolysis in the peripheral blood (although alpha thalassemia has some degree of ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow), whereas beta thalassemia is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and red blood cell (RBC) destruction in the bone marrow. Alpha and beta thalassemia major are associated with life-threatening anemia and transfusion dependence, and sickle cell disease is associated with potentially life-threatening vaso-occlusive phenomena. There are also differences in the approach to diagnostic testing for suspected hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, which is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3819743999\" class=\"local\">'Available testing methods'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3980016211\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hb variants</strong> &ndash; Hb variants are qualitative defects that cause a change in the secondary or tertiary structure of the Hb molecule. The majority of Hb variants do not cause disease and are discovered incidentally (eg, when detected in combination with a clinically important abnormal Hb). A subset of Hb variants can cause severe disease when inherited in the homozygous state or in combination with another abnormal variant or a beta thalassemia mutation. When clinical consequences occur, they may include anemia due to hemolysis or polycythemia due to abnormal oxygen handling. Common examples of hemoglobin variants associated with hemolysis include sickle Hb (Hb S), Hb C, and Hb D. Hb variants can usually be detected by protein-based assay methods; however, DNA-based methods may be required for variants with ambiguous or unusual results from protein analysis. (See <a href=\"#H1120493692\" class=\"local\">'Protein chemistry methods'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2965916570\" class=\"local\">'Molecular (DNA-based) methods'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The major types of consequences of Hb variants for the Hb molecule can be classified as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Change in physical properties</strong> &ndash; Beta globin mutations can alter the solubility of the Hb molecule. As examples, Hb S polymerizes when deoxygenated, and Hb C crystalizes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reduced protein stability</strong> &ndash; Unstable Hb variants are mutations (typically in beta globin) that cause the Hb molecule to precipitate, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Precipitated Hb can attach to the inner layer of the plasma membrane and form Heinz bodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1749383969\" class=\"local\">'Heinz body prep'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Change in oxygen affinity</strong> &ndash; High or low oxygen affinity Hbs are more likely than normal to adopt the relaxed (R, oxy) state or the tense (T, deoxy) state, respectively. High oxygen affinity variants (R state) cause polycythemia (eg, Hb Chesapeake, Hb Montefiore). Low oxygen affinity variants can cause cyanosis (eg, Hb Kansas, Hb Beth Israel). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Oxidation of heme iron</strong> &ndash; Mutations of the heme binding site, particularly those affecting the conserved proximal or distal histidine residues, can produce M-Hbs, in which the iron atom in heme is oxidized from the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) state to the ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) state, with resultant methemoglobinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thalassemias</strong> &ndash; Thalassemias are quantitative defects that lead to reduced levels of one type of globin chain, creating an imbalance in the ratio of alpha-like chains to non-alpha-like chains. As noted above, this ratio is highly regulated to prevent excess globin chains of one type from accumulating. The excess chains will fail to incorporate into Hb and instead form non-functional aggregates that precipitate within the RBC. This can lead to premature RBC destruction in the bone marrow (beta thalassemia) or in the peripheral blood (alpha thalassemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of the thalassemic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Beta thalassemias</strong> &ndash; Beta thalassemias are characterized by reduced levels of beta globin chains. Beta thalassemias are typically caused by point mutations that disrupt regulatory elements of beta globin gene expression. Beta thalassemia mutations are expressed as beta<sup>+</sup> alleles if some beta globin is produced, or beta<sup>0</sup> if beta globin production is absent from that gene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H1271747666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Overview and typical presentations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Alpha thalassemias</strong> &ndash; Alpha thalassemias are characterized by reduced levels of alpha globin chains. The majority of alpha thalassemias are caused by large deletions of one or both of the alpha globin genes (<em>HBA1</em> and <em>HBA2</em>), which are located in tandem on chromosome 16 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). Single-gene deletions of <em>HBA1</em> or <em>HBA2</em> are often co-inherited with beta globin gene mutations. Large deletions that result in loss of both <em>HBA1</em> and <em>HBA2</em> are prevalent in Southeast Asian populations, and when co-inherited with a single alpha gene deletion from the other parent these large deletions result in Hb H disease. Homozygous inheritance of large deletions involving both alpha globin genes (ie, loss of all four alpha genes) results in alpha thalassemia major or &quot;hydrops fetalis.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3786212779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin H disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H1291863480\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin Barts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rarely, thalassemic mutations may also result in altered Hb structure. An example is Hb Lepore, a fusion Hb in which the 5&rsquo; &delta;-globin sequences are fused to 3&rsquo; &beta;-globin sequences with deletion of the intergenic DNA, which places the &delta;&beta;-fusion gene under the transcriptional control of the inefficient &delta;-globin promoter, causing low expression of the fusion globin. Examples of mutations that cause an amino acid change by creating an aberrant splice site include Hb E, Hb Knossos, and Hb Malay. Another type of mutation causes &quot;hyper-unstable&quot; globins, in which the nascent globin chains are highly unstable and undergo rapid proteolytic degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mutations or deletions in gamma and delta globin genes may also give rise to a spectrum of disorders ranging from clinically benign hereditary persistence of fetal Hb (HPFH) to symptomatic delta-beta (&delta;&beta;) thalassemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in health and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial screening for a thalassemia can be performed using protein-based methods, which may show alterations in the ratio of normal Hbs (eg, increased Hb F or Hb A2); however, confirmation of the diagnosis of alpha and beta thalassemia requires DNA analysis. (See <a href=\"#H2965916570\" class=\"local\">'Molecular (DNA-based) methods'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3819743999\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE TESTING METHODS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2402392903\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods for analyzing Hbs continue to advance, and a number of techniques suitable for hemoglobinopathy detection are routinely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These methods can be broadly divided into protein-based (protein chemistry) and DNA-based (molecular) methods. An overview of the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Historically, electrophoresis methods were used to evaluate many common hemoglobinopathies; electrophoresis can resolve Hb S, Hb A2, and Hb F. Electrophoresis is still routinely used in many laboratories; however, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) have become the methods of choice for detecting these Hbs and other Hb variants. In general, laboratories with high testing volumes will use HPLC since it can be automated with rapid results.</p><p>Information from the family history and parent testing including complete blood count (CBC), combined with one or more protein-based methods, is often sufficient for definitive diagnosis of common Hb variants. DNA-based methods are especially important for diagnosing alpha thalassemias and beta thalassemias. Other uses of DNA-based methods are evolving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120493692\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein chemistry methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H934413265\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of protein chemistry methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein-based methods remain the method of choice for initial qualitative and quantitative hemoglobin analyses (ie, ratios of different hemoglobins and absolute quantification of the amounts of Hb A2 and Hb F). Several protein chemistry techniques are routinely used in clinical laboratories, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); isoelectric focusing (IEF); capillary electrophoresis (CE); and alkaline and acid gel electrophoresis. Most laboratories will use one of these methods as a first step to identify an Hb variant, followed by an alternative protein technique to confirm an abnormal result on initial testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The figures show examples of typical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPLC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72323 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63052 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50316 \">figure 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52896 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63606 \">figure 8</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65032 \">figure 9</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gel electrophoresis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72323 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806 \">figure 10</a>)</p><p/><p>When results are reported, the Hbs are listed in the order of abundance (from the highest to the lowest amount). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HB AS indicates that the amount of Hb A is greater than the amount of Hb S, consistent with sickle cell trait.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hb SA indicates the amount of Hb S is greater than the amount of Hb A, consistent with sickle-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia.</p><p/><p>Advantages of HPLC and CE include excellent resolution of Hb fractions (both normal and variant Hbs), high reproducibility, capacity for automation, requirement for a very small blood sample, and rapid turnaround time. These advantages have led to the widespread adoption of these techniques. HPLC and CE can be used as complementary methods to resolve ambiguous results, and Hbs that are not detectable by one method may be resolved by the other. IEF and gel electrophoresis are less quantitative and thus less useful for accurately quantifying Hbs present in low concentrations. However, they function well for identifying several common hemoglobinopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568611104\"><span class=\"h3\">HPLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become a preferred method to identify beta thalassemia, because it accurately quantitates Hb A2 and Hb F, as well as to use for population screening for hemoglobinopathies, because it can be fully automated.</p><p>An example is prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathies (as performed in the United Kingdom) or primary newborn screening, especially in populations with high frequencies of beta thalassemia or alpha thalassemia. HPLC is recommended for beta thalassemia carrier detection because it can easily quantify Hb A2 and Hb F. HPLC is also effective for settings in which quantification is important, such as assessing Hb S and Hb F percentages in individuals receiving transfusion or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> therapy for sickle cell disease. (See <a href=\"#H343827136\" class=\"local\">'Population screening (eg, routine newborn screen)'</a> below.)</p><p>HPLC separates many normal and variant Hbs, including Hbs A, A2, F, S, C, O-Arab, D-Punjab, and G-Philadelphia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72323 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63052 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50316 \">figure 6</a>). HPLC permits presumptive identification of many more Hb variants than can be distinguished by electrophoresis. HPLC can quantify normal and abnormal variants and can incorporate internal controls for the most common variants; and results can be compared with an available reference library of unusual variants.</p><p>In HPLC, Hbs are adsorbed to a negatively charged resin column (stationary phase) and then eluted from the column by a positively charged solution that is added in increasing concentration and competes for binding to the negatively charged resin. Hbs are thus differentially eluted at a rate related to their affinity for the column and detected by a photometer. The resulting elution patterns (Hb peaks) are graphically represented in defined windows based on their relative time to appearance in the eluate (retention time). The size of the Hb fractions can be quantified by computing the area under the curve for each peak.</p><p>Disadvantages of HPLC include overlap of some Hbs. As an example, Hb E, Hb Korle-Bu, and Hb Lepore may all overlap with Hb A2. Hb A2 may also be falsely elevated in the presence of Hb S. Separation of Hbs varies somewhat between instruments, reagents, and programs used for HPLC. The presence of glycosylated or acetylated Hbs, and artifacts, may yield complex patterns, and interpretation should be performed by experienced laboratory personnel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H413903895\"><span class=\"h3\">Isoelectric focusing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isoelectric focusing (IEF) has become a preferred method for analyzing and identifying abnormal Hbs because it has great precision and accuracy (greater than standard gel electrophoresis). IEF detects Hb S, C, E, A2, Hb D-Punjab (Hb D-LA), and Hb G-Philadelphia. IEF can also detect fast-migrating Hbs characteristic of alpha thalassemia such as Hb H (a tetramer of beta globin chains) and Hb Barts (a tetramer of gamma globin chains), making it particularly useful for newborn screening. (See <a href=\"#H343827136\" class=\"local\">'Population screening (eg, routine newborn screen)'</a> below.)</p><p>IEF is an electrophoretic technique for separating Hbs based on their net charge within a pH gradient on a gel medium (eg, polyacrylamide, thin-layer agarose). Hbs migrate through a pH gradient to a point at which their net charge is zero (ie, isoelectric point [pI]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52896 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63606 \">figure 8</a>). The Hb migration pattern of IEF is the same as that of alkaline gel electrophoresis, but with resolution of Hb C from Hb E and Hb O, and Hb S from Hb D and Hb G. In addition, Hb A and Hb F are clearly resolved.</p><p>Disadvantages of IEF are that it cannot be used to distinguish Hb E from Hb C-Harlem or Hb O-Arab; and it cannot distinguish Hb G-Philadelphia from Hb Lepore. Scanning densitometry of the gel can be used to obtain a quantitative measurement of the size of the bands, but it is not precise enough for accurate quantification of low-abundance Hbs such as Hb A2. Thus, IEF is not as useful as HPLC or CE for routine testing in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H821389064\"><span class=\"h3\">Capillary electrophoresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be used as an initial test for primary newborn screening or as a complementary method to detect and quantify abnormal Hbs and to resolve ambiguous results from another protein-based method. CE can be performed on red blood cell (RBC) hemolysates from dried blood spots, cord blood, or whole blood samples, making it potentially useful for newborn screening. CE is comparable to HPLC in its high resolution, ability to quantify low abundance Hbs, lack of interference from glycated proteins, ability to automate, and speed (multiple samples can be run together with an eight-minute run time). Examples of complementary methods include using CE to resolve a falsely elevated Hb A2 detected in the presence of Hb S by HPLC, or using HPLC to resolve Hbs that fall in the same window as Hb A by CE.</p><p>CE is a type of electrophoresis similar to gel electrophoresis, but it uses a liquid buffer rather than an agarose gel to separate and quantify normal and abnormal Hbs. Hb variants are separated by electro-osmotic flow using negatively charged silica capillaries and a high voltage current. The resulting tracing is divided into 15 zones in which normal and variant Hbs are displayed as peaks, which can be quantified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65032 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>Disadvantages of CE include cost, need for technical expertise, and poor separation of Hb S from Hb D. It is impractical for primary newborn screening in the United States because of the different size of the dried blood spot required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1238832513\"><span class=\"h3\">Gel electrophoresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gel electrophoresis continues to be used in a number of clinical settings; it can separate several normal Hbs including Hb A, Hb A2, and Hb F; and a number of variant Hbs including Hb S and Hb C. Its simplicity and low cost make Hb gel electrophoresis a valuable complementary method for detection of common Hb variants. However, for first-line screening for hemoglobinopathies, gel electrophoresis has been replaced by more sensitive, reliable, and automatable methods such as IEF, HPLC, and CE.</p><p>Electrophoresis is the classical method used to separate Hb proteins based on their net charge. An electric field is applied to a gel medium at a specific pH. The gel can be run at alkaline pH (cellulose acetate) or acidic pH (citrate agar). At alkaline pH, Hbs with a greater net negative charge will migrate more rapidly towards the positively charged anode of an electrical field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68806 \">figure 10</a>).

Separation of some co-migrating Hbs can be accomplished at acidic pH (eg, separation of Hb C and Hb O from Hb E and Hb A2; separation of Hb S from Hb D and Hb G). However, it is not possible to distinguish Hb E from Hb A2 or to separate Hb D from Hb G.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is also not possible to quantify Hb variants present in low concentrations or to quantify the low abundance adult Hb A2 accurately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is difficult to detect fast-moving Hb variants seen in alpha thalassemia (Hb H and Hb Barts).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not ideal for high-throughput analysis because it requires manual processing and experienced laboratory staff to interpret the results.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2965916570\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular (DNA-based) methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1096743854\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of DNA-based methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA testing (also referred to as genotyping or molecular testing) determines the DNA sequence encoding the globin chain (or the absence of part of the gene) rather than the protein's amino acid composition. There are a number of available methods, and it is possible to analyze one gene or multiple genes at a time, depending on the method and equipment used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>DNA-based methods are rarely used as a first-line test for a hemoglobinopathy, although the role of first-line DNA testing is evolving. Incorporating DNA testing into routine use as a second-tier screening method has become more accepted. Molecular methods are especially useful for confirming clinically significant disease in patients with suspected thalassemia, and in the setting of prenatal and newborn screening. Potential advantages of DNA testing in newborns includes the ability to identify defects in globin chains before these chains are expressed (eg, identification of beta globin defects during early infancy, when the predominant beta-like chain has not yet shifted from gamma globin to beta globin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109086 \">figure 2</a>). By contrast, diagnosis using protein-based methods requires waiting until the infant is three months of age and producing adult Hbs. Earlier identification of thalassemia in these settings offers the possibility of early diagnosis, genetic counseling, and early institution of appropriate treatment.</p><p>Other advantages of DNA-based testing include rapid turnaround time (hours) for some methods, high reliability, potential for automation, continually decreasing costs, and ongoing protocol improvements. In addition, introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) techniques may allow broader screening for multiple hemoglobinopathies simultaneously.

If gap-PCR does not identify an alpha thalassemia deletion, direct DNA sequencing can be used to detect an alpha thalassemia point mutation. (See <a href=\"#H2808429606\" class=\"local\">'Gap-PCR and MLPA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3679680453\" class=\"local\">'Traditional DNA sequencing and allele-specific PCR'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For beta thalassemia, DNA-based methods can also be used if definitive diagnosis and characterization of the genetic defect is required.</p><p/><p>The choice of DNA testing method depends on the type of variant suspected. Traditional sequencing and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to detect point mutations and to evaluate breakpoint mutations when a deletion has been identified. Gap-PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) are used to detect deletions.</p><p>All of the DNA-based methods can be performed on DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. For prenatal diagnosis, amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villus samples can be used. The DNA is typically amplified by PCR (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-polymerase-chain-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Polymerase chain reaction&quot;</a>) and then genotyped for a definitive diagnosis. Use of these methods on cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation for hemoglobinopathy diagnosis remains investigational. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are some general limitations to DNA-based testing, which depend on the specific testing method used. As examples, certain sequencing and PCR methods may fail to identify large gene deletions due to missing primer annealing sites. This can be circumvented by performing initial testing at the protein level (IEF, CE, or HPLC) or by using methods specifically designed to identify large deletions (see <a href=\"#H2808429606\" class=\"local\">'Gap-PCR and MLPA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3733321727\" class=\"local\">'Array CGH'</a> below). Another disadvantage of DNA-based methods is the cost of equipment and reagents, which remain significantly higher than for most of the protein-based techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3679680453\"><span class=\"h3\">Traditional DNA sequencing and allele-specific PCR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DNA sequencing determines the nucleotide sequence of a gene or genes. Traditional (Sanger) sequencing is the gold standard for DNA sequencing. It is often used when a specific type of globin gene defect (eg, alpha or beta thalassemia variant) is suspected, in which case it can be targeted to one or more of the affected globin genes, as shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75837\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75837 \">figure 11</a>).</p><p>Allele-specific assays can be used to target the presence or absence of a specific allele. Allele-specific PCR employs a set of manufactured oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to and specifically amplify sequences of DNA containing the target alleles of interest (eg, Hb A, Hb S, Hb C, Hb D, Hb E and Hb O-Arab). Analysis of the PCR products generated can be done by electrophoresis based on the length of the fragments generated. Alternatively, restriction enzymes can be used to cut the DNA at specified sequences that are present only in certain variants, followed by electrophoresis for the restriction enzyme products; this is referred to as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.</p><p>Sanger sequencing can also be used to scan for a spectrum of point mutations causing the most common Hb variants and beta thalassemia genotypes using an automated 96-well format in which overlapping PCR fragments and universal tagged primers are employed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2808429606\"><span class=\"h3\">Gap-PCR and MLPA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gap polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR) techniques are used to test for large deletions in the alpha globin or beta globin genes that cannot be detected by DNA sequencing. This method is particularly useful for detection of alpha thalassemia deletions that are common in certain populations.</p><p>Gap-PCR is a variation of PCR, but unlike PCR used for gene sequencing, gap-PCR is used to identify deletion breakpoints. This is done with PCR primers that flank a known deletion breakpoint rather than a normal gene sequence. Thus, the primers will only generate a product if the patient's DNA contains the unique sequence characteristic of that gene deletion. The most common example is alpha thalassemia, for which primers specific for the most common deletions can be combined; an example is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55893\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55893 \">figure 12</a>). Gap-PCR is also routinely used to detect deletions in the delta and beta globin genes that result in a <span class=\"nowrap\">delta/beta</span> hybrid variant known as Hb Lepore (see <a href=\"#H11822192\" class=\"local\">'Types of abnormalities'</a> above), as well as globin gene deletions causing HPFH and alpha globin gene duplications. Products of gap-PCR are analyzed by gel electrophoresis and compared with known positive control samples; the presence of the abnormal band on the gel is indicative that the individual carries the particular deletion.</p><p>Gap-PCR is not as useful for evaluating unusual or uncharacterized thalassemia deletions, because it will only detect deletions for which the breakpoints are known.</p><p>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is increasingly used to find large deletions and duplications within the globin genes, similar to the indications for gap-PCR. However, unlike gap-PCR, which can only identify deletions for which breakpoints are known, MLPA can also identify deletions with unknown breakpoints, especially large deletions in the alpha or beta globin genes. MLPA is a variation of PCR in which a pair of ligated probes rather than the target gene sequences are amplified by PCR. A pair of probes will only be amplified when they hybridize close enough together on the target gene in the patient's DNA to be ligated by DNA ligase, and they will only hybridize close together on the target gene when the full gene sequence is present. Thus, failure to generate a PCR product indicates deletion of a region of DNA in that part of the gene. Further, the relative amounts of the PCR products can be used to determine whether the deletion is homozygous (absence of the product) or heterozygous (50 percent reduction in the amount of the product).</p><p>While MLPA is a useful tool to screen for deletions, it does not define the exact deletion breakpoints; confirmation by PCR-based sequencing to define the breakpoints is required. Identification of the exact deletion breakpoints is helpful in predicting phenotype and determining if the patient has a deletion that arose de novo <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> was not previously described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3733321727\"><span class=\"h3\">Array CGH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH; also known as fine tiling array) is another molecular approach to confirming thalassemia defects comprehensively across the alpha and beta globin genes. Besides point mutations and small deletions, aCGH also detects copy number variations (CNVs), inversions, insertions, deletions and other complex rearrangements, most of which are not detected by standard DNA sequencing.</p><p>aCGH is primarily used to characterize a deletion that has been detected by MLPA, such as when MLPA identifies that a deletion is present in an alpha or beta globin gene but does not allow determination of the exact breakpoint. In this setting, aCGH may be less time-consuming and cumbersome than gap-PCR to characterize deletions and duplications caused by recombination (eg, delta-beta thalassemias).</p><p>In aCGH, the patient's genomic DNA is hybridized to a microarray containing tens to hundreds of thousand overlapping oligonucleotide probes, each approximately 60 to 80 nucleotides in length. Custom, high resolution tiling arrays are available for thalassemia diagnosis in which the collection of probes represents the majority of the DNA sequence in the complete alpha and beta globin gene clusters as well as the neighboring regions. Thus, aCGH can identify any areas of either gene, including coding regions and regulatory regions (such as introns) that are present in normal levels, reduced levels, excess levels, or completely absent.</p><p>The major disadvantages of aCGH include cost, need for trained personnel, and longer turnaround time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2000999790\"><span class=\"h3\">NGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Next-generation sequencing (NGS),<sup> </sup>also referred to as massively parallel or deep sequencing, refers to sequencing technologies that simultaneously determine the sequence of multiple short DNA fragments (&quot;reads&quot;), allowing rapid and less costly sequencing of multiple genes (or the whole exome or even the entire genome). NGS sequencing is not routinely used for hemoglobinopathy testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An investigational NGS platform<sup> </sup>covering the entire spectrum of known beta thalassemia mutations as well as the common Hb variants including Hb S, Hb C, and Hb D, has been developed to test 100 patient samples in a single run. Potential advantages of using NGS for hemoglobinopathy testing include the ability to perform simultaneous sequencing of all of the globin genes in a single test, along with other genes that modify hemoglobin expression such as <em>BCL11A</em>, <em>MYB</em>, <em>GATA1</em>, and <em>GATA1</em>. NGS can be performed on a smaller size sample than Sanger sequencing and has the potential for automation and reduced labor. However, the accuracy of NGS depends on the platform used and the depth of coverage, and results from NGS require confirmation by Sanger sequencing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H741992479\"><span class=\"h2\">Point-of-care assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Point-of-care (POC) assays or POC tests (POCTs) are tests that can be used directly at the place and time of patient evaluation, in areas without access to a specialized clinical laboratory. In principle, these types of assays can use protein or DNA-based methods. These tests may be especially useful in resource-limited settings with a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies or when a rapid intervention is required.</p><p>Several POC assays are in development for identifying sickle cell disease (SCD). Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sickle SCAN</strong> &ndash; &quot;Sickle SCAN&quot; is a point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for SCD that requires only a fingerprick blood sample mixed in a tube prefilled with buffer to form hemolysate. Five drops of the hemolysate are added to a test cartridge containing a test strip to which polyclonal antibodies against human Hb S, C, and A are fixed. As the hemolysate diffuses through the absorbent test strip, patient hemoglobins first bind to a labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the alpha-globin chain present in all hemoglobins. These labeled antigen-antibody complexes selectively bind to the test lines containing the polyclonal antibodies for visual detection of each Hb present. Results are robust and rapidly available, and the device can be used on dried blood spots or blood samples stored at 4&deg;C for up to one month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Testing of this assay on blood samples from 137 heterozygous and homozygous individuals accurately detected Hb A, Hb S, and Hb C with 99 percent sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further validation on samples collected at the point of care from 71 individuals with known hemoglobin genotypes showed 100 percent sensitivity and near-perfect specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a separate analysis of 139 newborns and adults, the device had high sensitivity (98 to 100 percent) and specificity (93 to 99 percent) for detecting Hb A and Hb S, and for distinguishing sickle cell trait from SCD and unaffected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The Sickle SCAN test identified all individuals with SCD without prior knowledge of disease status (ie, 100 percent sensitivity), as well as all individuals with Hb C variants. However, one person with sickle cell trait was misdiagnosed as having SCD, leading to a specificity of 98 percent. Based on survey results from 197 health care workers and 221 patients, over 97 percent indicated a willingness to recommend Sickle SCAN as a screening test for SCD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HemoTypeSC </strong>&ndash; &quot;HemoTypeSC&quot; is a POC immunoassay for SCD that uses a fingerprick blood sample to prepare a hemolysate that is added to a vial containing a test strip to which mAbs against Hb A, Hb S, and Hb C are immobilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The assay uses a competitive LFIA format in which labeled reagent hemoglobins compete with the patient's hemoglobins for binding to the immobilized mAbs. Thus, the presence of an Hb variant in the patient sample is indicated by the absence of a red-colored band at the test line. The greater specificity of the mAbs used in this test increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test over that of the Sickle SCAN device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When evaluated on whole blood samples from 100 individuals, this test correctly identified all of the hemoglobin phenotypes including homozygous and heterozygous forms of Hb A, Hb S, and Hb C. The test is easy to perform because it does not require extensive training or a separate dilution step, but interpretation may be non-intuitive for some testers because the absence of a band indicates the presence of a variant.

A finger (or heel) stick sample is processed on a piece of cellulose paper in alkaline buffer housed within a micro-engineered plastic chip wherein cellulose acetate electrophoresis is performed using a battery-powered electric field to separate hemoglobins.

A common practice is to use HPLC for newborn screening followed by IEF for confirmation, or vice versa (see <a href=\"#H3819743999\" class=\"local\">'Available testing methods'</a> above). Confirmation by a separate technique is likely to clarify ambiguous results and guide the decision regarding whether further evaluation using molecular testing methods is required for definitive diagnosis, especially in the thalassemias.

Hb S is one of the most commonly detected findings from the screening. In some populations, thalassemias are more prevalent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HPLC is particularly useful in the newborn period for diagnosing Hb H disease (also referred to as alpha thalassemia intermedia). Normally, the major Hb in the newborn is Hb F (a tetramer of two alpha and two gamma chains [&alpha;2&gamma;2]). In Hb H disease, there is marked deficiency of alpha globin chain production, and the excess gamma globin chains form a tetramer known as Hb Barts. Elevated levels of Hb Barts (eg, &gt;25 percent) within 12 to 48 hours after birth is the hallmark of Hb H disease in the newborn. The threshold for detection is based on validation data from a reference population; this may differ by region depending on which mutations are common in the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The timing is also important because Hb Barts levels fall rapidly after birth. Newborn screening programs may also detect some cases of alpha thalassemia trait. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3786212779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin H disease'</a>.)</p><p>All newborn screening results require confirmatory testing on a second sample, regardless of the initial screening test used and the clinical findings. For patterns consistent with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia (presence of Hb S or increased Hb A2, respectively), this may involve a second protein-based test; routine testing of the initial sample using a complementary method is performed to ensure that no methodologic or clerical errors were made. For newborns with suspected alpha thalassemia, suspected co-inheritance of two beta thalassemia mutations, or suspected Hb E in combination with a beta thalassemia mutation, molecular testing is required to make a definitive diagnosis. Some infants are retested after several months, especially those born prematurely who have very low levels of Hb A or only Hb F (see <a href=\"#H11822052\" class=\"local\">'Normal hemoglobins'</a> above).

Thus, testing for iron deficiency is often indicated. In some cases, testing for iron deficiency (and, if needed, treatment) precedes testing for thalassemia; this would be the case for an adult with microcytic anemia and possible blood loss. In other cases, testing for iron deficiency is performed concurrently with testing for thalassemia trait. This would be the case for an individual in whom prenatal screening detects microcytic anemia. Various indices that take into account the RBC indices and RBC count have been used to predict the likelihood of thalassemia trait versus iron deficiency (eg, ratio of mean corpuscular volume [MCV] to RBC count [Mentzer index]), although none of these is 100 percent sensitive and specific for making this distinction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].

For the remaining 5 percent, multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA) can be used to detect the presence of a deletion, followed by sequencing to define the breakpoints and characterize the deletion mutation, or array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can be used to detect the presence of a deletion and characterize the deletion mutation simultaneously.

(See <a href=\"#H1542015796\" class=\"local\">'Indications for hemoglobin analysis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and testing for hemoglobinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3987495500\" class=\"local\">'Overview of approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H244001803\" class=\"local\">'Clues from the CBC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common approaches to newborn screening and the laboratory evaluation of a suspected sickle cell disorder, suspected thalassemia, and unknown hemoglobin variants are described above. Typical hemoglobin patterns in these conditions are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 2</a>).
