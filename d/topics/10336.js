Pain control regimens must take into account medical, psychological, and physical condition; age; level of fear or anxiety; surgical procedure; personal preference; and response to agents given. The optimal strategy for perioperative pain control consists of multimodal therapy to minimize the need for opioids. The overprescribing of opioids has reached a critical level worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and surgery may be the trigger for long-term opioid use in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the rationale and therapeutic options for a multimodal approach to control and prevent acute perioperative pain. The management of chronic pain is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF PERIOPERATIVE PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative pain results from inflammation caused by tissue trauma (ie, surgical incision, dissection, burns) or direct nerve injury (ie, nerve transection, stretching, or compression) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56118\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56118 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The patient senses pain through the afferent pain pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74589 \">figure 2</a>), which is the target of various pharmacologic agents.</p><p>Tissue trauma releases local inflammatory mediators that can produce augmented sensitivity to stimuli in the area surrounding an injury (hyperalgesia) or misperception of pain to non-noxious stimuli (allodynia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53674\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53674 \">figure 3</a>). Other mechanisms contributing to hyperalgesia and allodynia include sensitization of the peripheral pain receptors (primary hyperalgesia) and increased excitability of central nervous system neurons (secondary hyperalgesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, acute perioperative pain management has relied solely on opioid medications to target central mechanisms involved in the perception of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60488 \">figure 4</a>). A better approach uses several agents, each acting at different sites of the pain pathway, and is known as multimodal analgesia. This approach reduces the dependence on a single medication and mechanism, and importantly, may reduce or eliminate the need for opioids. Synergy between opioid and nonopioid medications reduces both the overall opioid dose and unwanted opioid-related side effects.</p><p>Pain receptor activity can be directly blocked (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>), or antiinflammatory agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) can be used to diminish the local hormonal response to injury, thus indirectly decreasing pain receptor activation.</p><p>Some analgesic agents target the activity of neurotransmitters by inhibiting or augmenting their activity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76587\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76587 \">figure 5</a>). Neurotransmitters are responsible for carrying electrical signals across the gap junctions between neurons. To produce analgesia, the activity of several neurotransmitters can be targeted, including substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, aspartate, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE ANALGESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of postoperative pain has evolved from the sole administration of opioid medication in response to pain to, instead, the administration of a variety of medications and use of techniques to prevent acute and chronic pain. The concept of &quot;preemptive&quot; analgesia, ie, that analgesic strategies administered prior to surgical incision or stimulus can modify peripheral and central nervous system processing of noxious stimuli, thereby reducing central sensitization, hyperalgesia, and allodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], remains controversial. A number of studies have concluded that the preoperative timing is not necessary to achieve a reduction in postoperative pain and opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A more encompassing approach to the reduction of acute and chronic postoperative pain is the concept of &quot;preventive&quot; analgesia. The aim of preventive analgesia is to reduce sensitization by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative noxious stimuli, by treatments administered at any time in the perioperative period. A preventive analgesic is effective when postoperative pain or analgesic consumption is reduced beyond the duration of action of the treatment drug or technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>There are many effective preventive analgesic techniques using various pharmacological agents and interventions. They reduce nociceptor (pain receptor) activation by blocking or decreasing receptor activation and inhibiting the production or activity of pain neurotransmitters. The end result is a reduction in postoperative opioid use and opioid-related side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88573043\"><span class=\"h2\">Local anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local anesthetic can be injected in proximity to the surgical incision and will provide preventive analgesia. A metaanalysis of randomized trials found statistically significant decreases in analgesic consumption and increased time to first rescue analgesic request but no difference in postoperative pain scores in patients who had preincisional local anesthetic wound infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some randomized trials have shown that local anesthetic injection around small incision sites reduces postoperative somatic pain but is inadequate for visceral pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88573050\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For preventive analgesia, nonopioid systemic analgesics such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, antidepressants, and alpha<sub>2</sub> agonists can in some cases replace opioids, or can be effectively combined with opioids as part of a perioperative multimodal analgesic regimen, especially for opioid-tolerant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are commonly included in multimodal analgesic protocols, and the benefits of these medications in pain management have been well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In a metaanalysis of 52 randomized trials of multimodal analgesia with nonopioid analgesics, treatment with NSAIDs reduced opioid consumption, pain intensity, nausea and vomiting, and sedation compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a>, when bolused and infused intraoperatively, may also decrease opioid consumption during and after surgery, and possibly contributes to early return of bowel function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The perioperative use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> has also been shown to reduce postoperative opioid requirements and can be considered in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447933291\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGY FOR PERIOPERATIVE PAIN CONTROL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65831447\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective postoperative pain control starts well before the day of surgery. Having a multimodal approach does not necessarily mean doing the same thing for every patient, every time. Rather, a multimodal approach acts as a checklist to ensure that all applicable categories of pain medications are considered, selected, and dosed according to the individual patient's needs. A primary goal of perioperative pain management is to have the patient comfortable when he or she awakens from anesthesia, with a smooth transition from postanesthesia care to the surgical ward. The following questions should be considered when formulating a plan for perioperative pain control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How much pain is associated with the surgical procedure, and how long is it expected to last? </strong>&ndash; For example, some minor outpatient surgical procedures, such as excision of a small mass or limb surgery not involving bones or joints, are associated with lower levels of postoperative pain. For these cases, general anesthesia may be avoided by the use of regional blocks or surgeon-administered local anesthesia, along with monitored anesthesia care. When general anesthesia is indicated, a short-acting agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) at the time of induction and airway management may be the only opioid administered during the anesthetic. Local anesthetic injected into the wound by the surgeon and nonopioid analgesics should suffice for immediate postoperative pain control. In contrast, more invasive procedures can result in moderate to severe pain that will last for days or weeks, such as total joint replacement, open major abdominal surgery, or instrumented spinal fusion. These patients often require a more complex multimodal approach to perioperative pain control, with higher doses of intravenous (IV) opioids and longer-acting opioids. For surgeries amenable to epidural analgesia, the goal is to establish the appropriate analgesic level prior to emergence, at least 30 minutes before the end of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral opioids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H795595600\" class=\"local\">'Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and opioids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the procedure amenable to the use of regional or local analgesic techniques?</strong> &ndash; Whenever possible, local anesthesia, neuraxial analgesia, or peripheral nerve blocks should be used as part of the multimodal regimen for postoperative pain control. In some cases, a regional analgesic or anesthetic technique will provide adequate pain control without additional systemic medication (eg, brachial plexus block for upper extremity surgery). In other cases, opioids or nonopioid analgesics will be required in addition to one of these modalities. As an example, transversus abdominis plane blocks or infiltration of the incision with local anesthetic may alleviate incisional pain for intraabdominal and abdominal wall surgery (eg, hernia repair) but will not help with visceral pain that results from these procedures. (See <a href=\"#H795596357\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral nerve blocks'</a> below and <a href=\"#H795594911\" class=\"local\">'Regional analgesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The location of the surgery and anticipated sites of pain determine which nerve blocks should be performed, at which level(s) they should be performed, and whether they are even indicated. As an example, in a patient having upper abdominal surgery for whom epidural analgesia cannot be provided, other regional block techniques (eg, paravertebral or transversus abdominis plane blocks) may provide some pain relief, although additional systemic analgesia using opioids and nonopioid medications will likely be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Are there particular patient factors that affect the choice of analgesic options?</strong> &ndash; Specific regional analgesic techniques (eg, neuraxial blocks) are contraindicated in the setting of abnormal coagulation or platelet dysfunction and may be difficult to perform in patients with anatomic abnormalities such as obesity, ankylosing spondylitis, or prior spine surgery. Patients who chronically use opioids may require complex multimodal plans for perioperative pain control. Older patients and patients with obstructive sleep apnea may be more prone to the side effects of sedatives and opioids, requiring either dose modification or avoidance of these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65831453\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical scenarios</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While individual patient characteristics, surgical procedures, and clinical scenarios vary widely, the following are protocols for multimodal perioperative pain management followed at the author's institution. Remember that any multimodal analgesic protocol should serve as a checklist only, and should be modified to meet the needs of the individual patient, with careful consideration of existing staffing and institutional resources, medication formulary, and clinical environment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient having minor outpatient surgery, when applicable, we use regional or local anesthesia designed to provide several hours or more of postoperative analgesia, combined with intraoperative monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia. For patients who receive general anesthesia, we restrict breakthrough, as-needed pain medications in the recovery room to short-acting opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) boluses only when necessary, or we administer prescribed oral opioids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/opioid</span> combinations prior to discharge. (See <a href=\"#H447934137\" class=\"local\">'Fentanyl'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Oral opioids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H91156\" class=\"local\">'Oral NSAIDs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients having extremity surgery expected to produce moderate to severe postoperative pain, we regularly perform peripheral nerve blocks to provide several hours of postoperative pain relief (eg, brachial plexus block for upper extremity surgery) or insert a perineural catheter to provide two to three days of pain relief with a continuous local anesthetic infusion.

For major abdominal surgeries with extensive incisions, epidural infusions with local anesthetic provide superior pain relief when compared with parenteral opioids. With less extensive surgery, however, intrathecal opioids alone can be used for postoperative analgesia. A single dose of intrathecal (spinal) opioid can provide substantial pain relief up to 18 to 24 hours postoperatively. Neuraxial analgesia is also suitable for those patients who are chronically dependent on opioids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795595399\"><span class=\"h4\">Intrathecal opioid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small intrathecal doses of preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (0.1 to 0.2 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (10 to 20 mcg) are commonly coadministered with local anesthetic as part of a spinal anesthetic.

The onset of analgesia and its duration depend on the drug's relative lipophilicity or hydrophilicity and how it is transported within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The degree of uptake from the CSF by the dorsal horn is determined primarily by the physicochemical properties of the drug and, in particular, lipid solubility. Lipid-soluble compounds enjoy greater direct diffusion into neural tissue as well as greater delivery to the dorsal horn by spinal segmental arteries.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> is highly ionized and hydrophilic and does not penetrate lipid-rich tissues as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>. Intrathecal morphine reaches maximum effect in about 45 minutes and lasts for 18 to 24 hours. By comparison, fentanyl, which is more lipophilic (lipid-soluble), penetrates into the lipid-rich dorsal horn to act more quickly, but its duration of action is shorter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The lipophilicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> is midway between that of morphine and fentanyl. When used for labor analgesia, intrathecal fentanyl reaches maximal effect in 5 to 10 minutes and provides effective pain relief for one to two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>If a patient has severe breakthrough pain despite intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> administration, supplemental IV opioid may be administered as needed, with appropriate respiratory monitoring (oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide preferred). Typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (50 to 100 mcg IV) or morphine (1 to 3 mg IV) will produce almost immediate pain relief. Once breakthrough pain is controlled, the intrathecal morphine that was administered often provides adequate analgesia. Rarely, IV PCA with fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone will be required for inadequate pain relief after intrathecal morphine.

A dose of 2 to 3 mg of epidural morphine is commonly used for lumbar and low thoracic epidurals; however, for less painful surgery or high-risk patients, lower doses can provide adequate analgesia with fewer side effects. For example, epidural morphine 1.5 mg was as effective as 3 mg for postcesarean delivery pain and was associated with a 60 percent reduction in pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795595600\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of a local anesthetic and opioid is commonly administered by infusion via an epidural catheter for postoperative pain, especially for abdominal and thoracic surgical procedures.

For abdominal surgery, the epidural catheter should be placed at a low thoracic or high lumbar level. For thoracic surgical procedures, the catheter should be placed at a midthoracic level. Epidural medications can be given by continuous infusion or may be given by patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). With PCEA, the patient has the ability to self-administer a bolus of epidural medication. The PCEA pump may be programmed with or without a basal infusion, a bolus dose, a lockout period before another bolus is possible, and a total allowable dose over a specific time period. For obstetric patients and surgical patients, bolus-only PCEA with local anesthetic and opioid may provide similar analgesia to continuous infusion while requiring significantly less volume of the compounded solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-perioperative-pain/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>].</p><p>Protocols for epidural infusion depend on the drugs chosen and are institution-specific.

Postoperatively, additional incremental boluses of local anesthetic (eg, 2 to 10 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.125% or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1 to 2%) may be administered by the anesthesiologist if the patient is experiencing breakthrough pain upon emergence from anesthesia. When a bolus is given, the patient must be monitored closely for hypotension. Once analgesia is achieved, the epidural infusion regimen is resumed. If the patient continues to experience breakthrough pain, the regimen should be adjusted to increase the basal rate, PCEA bolus volume, or both, with careful consideration of the maximum allowable hourly volume. Since epidural regimens vary by institution, every provider should refer to his or her institutional policies and procedures governing epidural infusion management.</p><p>Occasionally, postoperative analgesia is not satisfactory due to extensive surgery or patchy coverage by the epidural block. If PCEA or continuous infusion of low-dose combined local anesthetic and opioid solution is inadequate, an alternative approach is to split the epidural infusion. With this technique, a continuous epidural infusion of local anesthetic is used, while the opioid is administered by IV PCA. The split approach may provide more effective pain control if an epidural block does not cover the entire surgical site or if the patient has other, nonsurgical pain.</p><p>Rarely, other adjuvants may be administered via epidural infusion in combination with local anesthetics: alpha<sub>2</sub> agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>), NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>), and cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>).

An optimal strategy for perioperative pain control consists of multimodal therapy to minimize the need for opioids. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a multimodal approach to preventive analgesia with regional analgesic techniques and drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, before induction of general anesthesia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preventive analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following ambulatory surgery, we suggest treatment of acute pain in the recovery room with short-acting intravenous (IV) opioids, followed by oral opioids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/opioid</span> combinations, or NSAIDs upon discharge (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Oral analgesics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following minimally-invasive intraabdominal surgical procedures, when appropriate, we suggest regional analgesic techniques, such as local anesthetic wound infiltration, transversus abdominis plane blocks, or paravertebral blocks. For further analgesia when postoperative fasting is required, we suggest patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or nurse-administered opioid boluses using IV opioids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H795594284\" class=\"local\">'Patient-controlled analgesia'</a> above). We suggest the addition of an NSAID and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> if not contraindicated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H795594570\" class=\"local\">'Nonopioid adjunctive medication'</a> above). Oral medication can be prescribed as tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Oral analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For major open abdominal or thoracic surgery, and for the patient who is dependent on opioids, we suggest neuraxial analgesic techniques in addition to general anesthesia, using either continuous epidural analgesia or single-injection epidural or spinal opioid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition to preventive analgesia, the neuraxial approach provides effective, targeted postoperative analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preventive analgesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H795594971\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial opioid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For neuraxial analgesia, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> via the epidural (up to 3 mg morphine) or intrathecal (up to 0.2 mg morphine) route to provide postoperative pain relief for up to 18 to 24 hours; this can be supplemented with NSAIDs without increasing the risk of postoperative respiratory depression (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preventive analgesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H795594971\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial opioid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H795594284\" class=\"local\">'Patient-controlled analgesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H795594570\" class=\"local\">'Nonopioid adjunctive medication'</a> above). If further analgesia is required, additional IV opioids by nurse-administered bolus or PCA can be used with appropriate monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H795596143\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the patient who has received neuraxial analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients for whom pain relief is required for more than 24 hours, we suggest postoperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with a lumbar or low thoracic epidural catheter placed preoperatively (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H795595600\" class=\"local\">'Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and opioids'</a> above). Patients who have received neuraxial opioid or continuous epidural infusions should be monitored for efficacy and side effects. (See <a href=\"#H795596143\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the patient who has received neuraxial analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, we suggest continuing the usual dose of methadone through the perioperative period, either orally or, if necessary, IV at half the usual dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Postoperative pain may be treated with additional opioids as needed. We suggest the use of regional analgesic techniques, even for less invasive surgeries, to lower opioid requirements (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H795596667\" class=\"local\">'Opioid-dependent patients'</a> above). Other elements of multimodal analgesia (ie, opioid and nonopioid medications) should be employed; this decision should be individualized depending on the surgery and patient factors. (See <a href=\"#H795596673\" class=\"local\">'Patients taking methadone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> having surgery with minimal postoperative pain, we suggest continuing buprenorphine and maximizing the use of nonopioid analgesics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If moderate to severe postoperative pain is expected, we coordinate care with the clinician who prescribes the patient's medication. For these patients, we maximize the use of nonopioid analgesics, including regional anesthesia techniques, and administer IV opioids as necessary. (See <a href=\"#H90048\" class=\"local\">'Patients taking buprenorphine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For morbidly obese patients undergoing abdominal or thoracic surgery, we suggest postoperative epidural analgesia to reduce systemic opioid requirement and the risk of respiratory depression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The medications administered via the epidural catheter should be individualized.
