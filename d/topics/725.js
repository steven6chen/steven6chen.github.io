(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-uses-of-amiodarone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical uses of amiodarone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary toxicity is among the most serious adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. Several forms of pulmonary disease occur among patients treated with amiodarone, including interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), pulmonary nodules and solitary masses, and also (rarely) pleural effusion. Other adverse effects from amiodarone include photosensitivity, blue-gray discoloration of the skin, thyroid dysfunction, corneal deposits, abnormal liver function tests, and bone marrow suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The types, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity will be reviewed here. The other major side effects of amiodarone are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial pneumonitis is the most common presentation of amiodarone-induced pulmonary disease. Interstitial pneumonitis usually presents after two or more months of therapy, especially in patients in whom the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> exceeds 400 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of pulmonary toxicity from amiodarone is not precisely known; it is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent, depending on the dose of amiodarone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The rate increases at higher doses of amiodarone, particularly long-term use of doses over 500 mg daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms involved in amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis are incompletely understood. Two major hypotheses have been suggested, a direct toxic injury to lung cells and an indirect immunologic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Genetic susceptibility of certain individuals may play an additional role in determining the type of injury that ensues. Whether these processes pertain to other forms of amiodarone-induced lung toxicity is not known.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytotoxicity</strong> &ndash; A direct toxic reaction in the lung is supported by the following findings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> has a long half-life and a high tissue affinity for the lung. In addition, an active metabolite of amiodarone, monodesethylamiodarone (DEA), exhibits cytotoxic activity and tends to accumulate in the lungs even more than amiodarone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug-phospholipid complexes accumulate in lung cells (eg, macrophages, interstitial cells) and interfere with normal cellular metabolic pathways, which ultimately leads to direct cell injury and death. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell death have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung injury is controversial. On one hand, induction of autophagy is considered to be a host-protective response to amiodarone-induced cellular toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> was found to induce autophagy-dependent apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The cellular injury is thought to cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> alters the phospholipid bilayer, which in turn disrupts cellular and organelle membrane function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Toxic oxygen species resulting in tissue injury are generated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Based on evidence from experimental animal models, stimulation of the angiotensin enzyme system may contribute to the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung cell apoptosis, airway epithelial cell injury, mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria, and interalveolar septal thickening. Furthermore, concomitant administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>, in the amiodarone-exposed animals attenuated these histopathologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, a retrospective analysis found that the prevalence of amiodarone-related lung disease was greater in patients not on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, lending credence to this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Another study implicates elevated levels of angiotensin II as increasing the risk for amiodarone-induced lung toxicity because repeated episodes of heart failure, which are associated with increased angiotensin II, appear to be a risk factor. Preliminary studies suggest that co-administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be protective against <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> lung toxicity, although this potential effect has not been sufficiently studied to guide treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> &ndash; An immunologic reaction is suggested by several patients who presented with histopathologic features of a hypersensitivity pneumonitis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lymphocytic infiltration, often with &quot;intraalveolar buds&quot; (organizing pneumonia-like reaction)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CD8 T-cell lymphocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive IgG immunofluorescence in the lung</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity are uncertain but may include a high cumulative dose, a daily dose greater than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> a duration of therapy exceeding two months, increased patient age, preexisting lung disease, thoracic or nonthoracic surgery, and pulmonary angiography. In a retrospective analysis of over 200 patients with amiodarone lung toxicity, patients over 60 years old and those on amiodarone for 6 to 12 months had the highest risk of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cumulative dose</strong> &ndash; Pulmonary toxicity correlates more closely with the total cumulative dose than with serum drug levels. Consistent with this observation, pulmonary toxicity usually occurs several months to several years after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/2,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,18</a>]. However, there exist anecdotal cases of severe pulmonary toxicity developing within two to three weeks of therapy with low cumulative doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Daily dose</strong> &ndash; Early reports (when patients were usually treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> doses &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> noted a 5 to 15 percent incidence of pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. The incidence appears to be lower (1 to 5 percent) with smaller maintenance doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/2,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,22</a>]. As an example, one study of 573 patients demonstrated that patients who developed pulmonary toxicity took higher daily doses than those who did not develop pulmonary disease (517 versus 409 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, there were no cases of pulmonary toxicity when the maintenance dose was below 305 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the likelihood of pulmonary toxicity may be less in patients receiving smaller daily doses, pulmonary toxicity may still occur at low doses, albeit infrequently. In a meta-analysis of four trials (1465 patients) that randomly assigned patients to receive a low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (150 to 330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo for a minimum of one year, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity with amiodarone was not statistically different from placebo (1.9 versus 0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a subsequent, eight-year retrospective study of over 6000 amiodarone users in Quebec, Canada, there was independent association of either lower dose amiodarone (&le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or higher dose amiodarone (&gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with alveolar and interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective series of 500 Japanese patients found that daily doses as low as approximately 140 mg per day were associated with a cumulative incidence of amiodarone lung toxicity of approximately 4 to 11 percent at one to five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Older age and higher maintenance dose of amiodarone were risk factors for lung toxicity, while pre-existing lung disease (eg, COPD, sarcoidosis), baseline diffusing capacity, and loading dose of amiodarone were not. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preexisting lung disease</strong> &ndash; An association between preexisting lung disease and the development of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pulmonary toxicity has been reported in some series. However, it is possible that these patients had limited pulmonary reserve and thus become symptomatic earlier in their course than other individuals. The following two studies illustrate the conflicting literature:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One randomized trial of 519 patients with heart failure found no accelerated loss of diffusing capacity among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, compared with those who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In contrast, a separate randomized trial demonstrated that patients with preexisting pulmonary disease had an increased risk of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The purpose of the evaluation is to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, exclude alternate diagnoses, and assess the severity of respiratory impairment. A careful history of medication use, symptoms suggestive of rheumatic disease, and occupational and environmental exposures is an important component of the evaluation, as with any interstitial lung disease. Similarly, the physical examination should include a search for exacerbation of cardiovascular disease and the presence of rheumatic disease with a potential pulmonary component.

HRCT in patients with amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis may show areas of high attenuation in the lungs, as well as the liver and spleen, due to the accumulation of iodinated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> in tissue macrophages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58121\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58121 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amiodarone-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Hemosiderin-laden macrophages, which may be demonstrated by Prussian blue staining, are also characteristic of DAH. While hemosiderin-laden macrophages can be seen in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, they are typically present in lower numbers than in pulmonary hemorrhage due to amiodarone.

The incidence of pulmonary toxicity from amiodarone is not precisely known; it is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent, depending on the dose of amiodarone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pneumonitis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity include a daily dose &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> duration of therapy exceeding two months, patient age &gt;60 years, preexisting lung disease, surgery, and pulmonary angiography. Pulmonary toxicity can also occur at lower daily doses. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Permanent discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is the primary therapy for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

Fever, pleuritic pain, weight loss, and malaise can also occur. The onset of symptoms is usually 6 to 12 months of amiodarone therapy, but may occur within two months or after several years of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H115635386\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The chest radiograph typically reveals new focal or diffuse reticular or ground glass opacities. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest and upper abdomen usually shows ground glass and reticular opacities and also increased attenuation in the lungs, liver, and spleen. Pulmonary function tests typically show restriction and a reduced diffusing capacity (DLCO). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed to exclude alternative diagnoses (eg, infection, hemorrhage, malignancy). Samples should be sent for cell counts, culture, and cytologic evaluation. The presence of &quot;foam&quot; cells (alveolar macrophages full of amiodarone-phospholipid complexes) is suggestive of, but not pathognomonic for, pulmonary toxicity.

The usual dose is the equivalent of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Due to the long elimination half-life (approximately 45 days) of amiodarone, pulmonary toxicity may initially progress despite drug discontinuation and may recur upon glucocorticoid withdrawal.
