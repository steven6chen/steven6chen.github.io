Chagas myocarditis is the most common cause of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in Latin America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The natural history of Chagas heart disease comprises an acute phase and a chronic phase. The chronic phase includes two forms of disease: an indeterminate (latent, preclinical) form and a determinate (clinical) form, which is subdivided into cardiac, digestive, and cardiodigestive forms. Most patients with acute disease have no or mild nonspecific symptoms and symptomatic myocarditis is rare. The indeterminate form is comprised of patients with evidence of T. cruzi infection without specific overt clinical evidence of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. Approximately one-third to one-half of patients with indeterminate disease eventually develops chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC).</p><p>Among 499 initially healthy blood donors in Brazil noted to have T. cruzi seropositivity on initial screening, 24 percent went on to develop Chagas cardiomyopathy during mean 10.5 years of follow-up; of these, 26 percent of patients presented with ejection fraction &lt;50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among 488 matched individuals with T. cruzi seronegativity, 5 percent developed cardiomyopathy during mean 11 years of follow-up. It is important to emphasize that the high annual incidence of Chagas cardiomyopathy noted in this study should not be extrapolated to the universe of individuals with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease, since it was a retrospective cohort study and no assessment of cardiac function by ECG or chest radiographs had been performed at the time of the initial seropositivity screening. This implies that at least some of the individuals could already be cardiomyopathy patients at the outset of the study despite presenting at the blood bank without symptoms. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation of cardiac involvement in CD will be reviewed here. Other issues related to CD, including treatment of Chagas heart disease, prognosis of CCC and noncardiac manifestations are discussed separately.

The diagnosis is established during the acute phase in less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most patients have generalized symptoms and signs such as fever and myalgia. A minority of patients have signs of heart failure, which is associated with significant risk of early mortality. The frequency and severity of clinical manifestations in the acute phase, including mortality due to myocarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meningitis-encephalitis, are inversely proportional to age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The symptoms and signs of cardiac involvement in acute Chagas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] are similar to those of myocarditis or myopericarditis due to other causes, and include dyspnea, fatigue (and other symptoms and signs of heart failure), chest pain, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac arrest as discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16764331\"><span class=\"h2\">Test results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first weeks of infection, serologic tests for T. cruzi infection are usually negative and other test findings are nonspecific (including leukocytosis with an absolute increase in lymphocyte count). Since the level of parasitemia is high in the acute phase, the diagnosis is based upon detection of circulating parasites by a variety of methods.</p><p>Although symptoms and signs of cardiac disease are commonly lacking, myocardial involvement is likely present in most if not nearly all patients diagnosed with acute CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cardiac test findings are nonspecific but denote the presence of myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiographic findings may include low voltage, bundle branch block, diffuse ST-T wave changes, or prolonged PR interval or more advanced AV block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59915\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef59915 \">waveform 1</a>). Sinus tachycardia is commonly present and the heart rate is often higher than attributable to fever alone. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia are uncommon. During recovery, the electrocardiographic findings resolve in over 90 percent of patients within one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest radiograph frequently demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette (cardiac-to-thoracic width ratio above 50 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52718\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52718 \">image 1</a>), which is usually due to presence of a pericardial effusion as demonstrated by echocardiography. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography often demonstrates a pericardial effusion. Right or left ventricular dilation are less commonly present. Global left ventricular ejection fraction is often normal or near normal, even among patients with regional wall motion abnormalities (anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apical dyskinesis or septal dyskinesis) or left ventricular dilatation, although a minority have depressed global systolic function. Mitral regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tricuspid regurgitation are frequently present. Valvular regurgitation often resolves after etiologic treatment of CD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of myocardial involvement was demonstrated by a study of 58 patients with acute CD in which myocarditis was found in all 26 undergoing endomyocardial biopsy, including eight patients with no other evidence of heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Typical findings are inflammatory changes with or without fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863000\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute CD is made by detection of circulating parasites by a variety of methods.<br/><br/>In patients with cardiac symptoms and signs, echocardiography is indicated to evaluate myocardial and pericardial disease and direct treatment. </p><p>Endomyocardial biopsy is generally not required to establish the diagnosis, except in the context of patients following cardiac transplantation, when the distinction between Chagas myocarditis and implant rejection is crucial. Intracellular T. cruzi amastigote nests are occasionally identified. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3864581\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute Chagas heart disease has a similar presentation to other causes of myocarditis and myopericarditis; these include infectious agents, cardiotoxins, hypersensitivity reactions, systemic disorders, and radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56995 \">table 1</a>). Acute CD should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly in those exposed to the typical endemic setting, and can be distinguished from other types of myocarditis and myopericarditis by detection of parasitemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopericarditis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopericarditis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16764346\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute phase symptoms and signs typically resolve over a period of one to three months. Mortality among patients diagnosed during the acute phase following an insect sting is about 5 percent and occurs predominantly in the setting of refractory heart failure, with or without encephalitis. Of note, when the infection is acquired by the oral route, the severity of the acute disease is more pronounced, including a higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is probably related to an enhanced parasite inoculation through the mucosae of the GI tract. Sudden death occurs rarely and is associated with heart failure, although it can occur without heart failure with a normal ejection in the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Management of acute disease is discussed separately.

However, further cardiovascular testing may demonstrate significant abnormalities in these patients.</p><p>The 2011 Latin American guidelines, in keeping with the classical concept of the indeterminate form, have adopted a definition that includes patients with clinically silent echocardiographic abnormalities who lack cardiomegaly on chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This guideline decision is explained by limited observational data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with the classically defined indeterminate form including a normal electrocardiogram, is generally the same as control individuals without chagasic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The guideline committee generally felt that a policy of investigating all patients with the indeterminate form for the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, would not be cost-effective, given the low expected prevalence of this derangement in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H114864642\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the classic definition of the indeterminate form is subject to several limitations including the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing with echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and exercise testing may demonstrate significant abnormalities in patients categorized as having the indeterminate form as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. Echocardiography is now readily available in most clinical settings, and it is known that regional LV wall abnormalities (including the typical apical aneurysm) may precede detection of cardiomegaly on chest radiographs. <br/><br/>Thus, an alternative definition of the indeterminate form has been proposed that includes demonstration of normal left ventricular global and regional systolic function by two-dimensional echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since asymptomatic patients are usually reluctant to undergo a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema test, many studies purporting to focus on the indeterminate form have ignored this criterion. It seems reasonable not to require the performance of barium enema in patients without constipation. </p><p/><p>Other tests that may reveal abnormalities in patients categorized as having the indeterminate form include radionuclide imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, autonomic evaluation, electrophysiologic testing, cardiac catheterization, and endomyocardial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863105\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with serologic evidence of chronic CD should be evaluated for cardiac involvement with a medical history, physical examination, and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably with a 30-second lead II rhythm strip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophageal and colon studies.</p><p>The indeterminate form of CD is diagnosed in patients with serologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitologic evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection who lack symptoms, physical signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities and any radiographic evidence (on chest radiograph, barium-contrast esophageal, or colon radiographs) of cardiac or gastrointestinal involvement. </p><p>Although not included in classical criteria for the indeterminate form, echocardiography is suggested as an additional test where resources allow. As noted above, an alternative definition of the indeterminate form includes demonstration of normal left ventricular global and regional systolic function by two-dimensional echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863119\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no formal guidelines regarding the optimal approach to screening for development of left ventricular dysfunction for patients with the indeterminate form in the chronic phase of the disease. We suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest repeating an ECG every one to two years and a chest radiograph every three to five years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest echocardiographic assessment at infrequent but regular intervals (three to five years) for all patients with the indeterminate form of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], because we have found that the presence of even minor segmental LV systolic abnormalities predicts future global LV systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, overt chronic CD may first manifest as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias; many patients with these complications have only regional LV systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p/><p>Monitoring of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels may be a useful tool to identify patients who should undergo echocardiography. In a controlled study of 151 patients seropositive for CD (90 percent of whom had an LVEF &gt;40 percent), among those with an abnormal ECG or chest radiograph, plasma BNP &ge;60.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> had good sensitivity and specificity for detection of LV dysfunction (80 and 97 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine the utility and cost-effectiveness of this approach prior to implementation in endemic areas.</p><p>The presence of gastrointestinal tract symptoms (eg, dysphagia, constipation) should prompt evaluation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast studies.

Arrhythmias may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, dyspnea, weakness, syncope, or sudden cardiac arrest. Complete heart block may cause dizziness or syncope. Autonomic dysfunction in the setting of CD results in marked abnormalities in the heart rate response to stimuli such as the Valsalva maneuver, exercise, and postural changes.</p><p>Virtually all types of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias occur, including sinus node dysfunction, intermittent complete atrio-ventricular block, and complex ventricular arrhythmias. Electrocardiography often demonstrates frequent premature depolarizations, runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial fibrillation, or complete atrioventricular (AV) block. Ventricular arrhythmias and AV block frequently occur concurrently. (See <a href=\"#H114864642\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p>The severity of ventricular arrhythmias tends to correlate with the degree of LV dysfunction, although some patients with VT and complete AV block have preserved global ventricular function, usually with regional wall motion abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>There is evidence suggesting that the mechanism of severe ventricular arrhythmia is related to the regional fibrosis and macro-re-entrant circuits. In an electrophysiologic study of 56 patients with CD and VT, patients with spontaneous sustained VT had a higher prevalence of wall motion abnormalities in the inferior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterolateral segments than those with no sustained VT. Scar in those regions was the main source of VT-related re-entrant circuits. A re-entrant substrate for the development of sustained VT existed in at least 50 percent of patients manifesting only nonsustained VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Another relevant pathophysiologic mechanism of severe ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in CCC may be related to the extensive myocardial sympathetic denervation found at the ventricular level. In a study involving 26 chagasic patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction, the detection of sustained ventricular tachycardia was associated with larger areas of viable but denervated myocardium identified by MIBG-I123 scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Sudden cardiac death accounts for approximately 55 to 65 percent of deaths in patients with chronic CD. The true frequency of this complication is probably underestimated, particularly in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Sudden death is often precipitated by exercise, and can be caused by VT or fibrillation, asystole, or complete AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most patients with sudden cardiac arrest have severe underlying heart disease, although sudden death has been reported in previously asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10250731\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thromboembolism is an important cause of stroke and other morbidity in patients with CD. Sources of systemic emboli include ventricular mural thrombi, which form in dilated cardiac chambers, particularly in left ventricular aneurysms.

Coronary angiography is helpful in establishing the presence and extent of coronary artery disease when the diagnosis is uncertain or when unstable coronary disease is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care#H94289721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;, section on 'Coronary angiography and revascularization'</a>.)</p><p>The apical aneurysm seen in some patients with the apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can generally be distinguished from CCC by concomitant apical hypertrophy.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with acute Chagas disease (CD) are asymptomatic or have a relatively mild nonspecific febrile illness. Subclinical cardiac involvement is present in most patients with acute CD but a minority of patients present with clinical manifestations of myopericarditis (including dyspnea and other evidence of heart failure, chest pain, arrhythmias), meningitis, and death. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute phase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indeterminate form of CD is classically characterized by absence of symptoms, physical signs, 12-lead-electrocardiographic abnormalities, and any radiographic evidence (on chest radiograph, barium-contrast esophageal or colon radiographs) of cardiac or gastrointestinal involvement in patients with serologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitologic evidence of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. However, further cardiovascular testing may demonstrate significant abnormalities in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indeterminate form'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected CD based on serology should undergo a medical history, physical examination, and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) preferably with a 30-second lead II rhythm strip. If findings are suggestive of Chagas heart disease, further cardiac evaluation is warranted, including echocardiography and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H16765461\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to screening for development of left ventricular dysfunction among patients presenting with the indeterminate form of disease is uncertain; we suggest echocardiographic assessment at regular intervals. (See <a href=\"#H3863119\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring guidelines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H114864649\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a sequela of persistent parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most common cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with CCC come to clinical attention with symptomatic complaints. In general, presentation with CCC occurs as a result of four clinical disorders that frequently overlap in the same patient: heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, thromboembolism, and chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H16765171\" class=\"local\">'Major clinical disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure in CCC is usually biventricular; both systolic and diastolic dysfunction can occur. The manifestations of right-sided failure (increased jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, ascites, and hepatomegaly) are frequently more pronounced than those of left-sided failure (dyspnea and pulmonary rales). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias in CCC may cause palpitation, lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope. Dizziness and syncope may also occur due to complete heart block or to ventricular tachycardia. Sudden cardiac death accounts for 55 to 65 percent of deaths in patients with chronic CD. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic and pulmonary thromboembolism occur in patients with CCC as a result of intracardiac and venous thrombosis in the setting of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated cardiac chambers, often with apical aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H10250731\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolism'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Schofield CJ, Dias JC.
