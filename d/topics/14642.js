PH can be purely postcapillary (secondary to elevated pulmonary venous pressure with normal pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]), purely precapillary (elevated PVR with normal pulmonary venous pressure), or a combination of the two (mixed PH). PH-congenital heart disease (PH-CHD) can also be secondary to increased flow through the pulmonary vasculature; this type of PH is not typically observed in non-CHD populations, aside from high output states such as severe anemia, thyrotoxicosis, cirrhosis, and large dialysis fistulae.

Some of these patients may have disproportionately high pulmonary artery pressure and resistance reflecting consequences of their CHD on the pulmonary arterial vasculature (eg, late repair of a ventricular septal defect), combined with elevated left heart filling pressures (eg, restrictive left ventricular filling). This mixed pre- and postcapillary PH is complex to manage, requiring attention to both the pre- and postcapillary components. PH-CHD may also occur in the setting of concomitant lung diseases (including acquired diseases such as sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease) or kyphoscoliosis (group 3, PH owing to lung disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia), pulmonary thromboembolic disease (group 4, chronic thromboembolic PH), and from other more uncommon causes such as extrinsic compression of the pulmonary arteries or vasculitis (group 5, PH with unclear multifactorial mechanisms).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2509710606\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may develop in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with left to right intracardiac or extracardiac shunts (atrial, ventricular, and great artery defects), especially when they are large and hemodynamically nonrestrictive, due to increased pulmonary blood volume <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pressure overload. Increases in flow through the pulmonary vasculature cause shear forces that disrupt the vascular endothelium and activate cellular mechanisms critical to the pathogenesis and progression of PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Eisenmenger syndrome is the most severe end-stage form of shunt-related PAH; the disorder is characterized by severe PAH with shunt reversal (right-to-left) and resulting hypoxemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70502\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70502 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients with PAH associated with coincidental or small cardiac shunt defects and those with persistent or worsening PAH despite closure of the defect should not be classified as Eisenmenger syndrome, but rather the broader category of PAH-CHD.

The combined effect of volume overload and shear forces elevates the pulmonary vascular resistance and reduces the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-group-1#H3603590160\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)&quot;, section on 'General physiologic mechanisms'</a>).

Other symptoms and signs related to complications include hemoptysis (which may be caused by intrapulmonary thrombosis or pulmonary hemorrhage) and symptoms and signs caused by cerebral hemorrhage (such as headache, vomiting, and neurologic signs). Fever and other manifestations of infection are seen with infective endocarditis, pneumonia, or intracerebral abscess. Arrhythmias may or may not produce symptoms. Syncope in a patient with PH-CHD with group 1 PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is worrisome and should prompt urgent evaluation and aggressive therapy. &#160;</p><p>Physical examination findings in the patient with PH-CHD are similar to those in patients with other causes of PH, including a right ventricular or parasternal lift on precordial palpation and loud P2 on auscultation. The other findings will depend on the underlying disease and severity of PH. In the setting of advanced disease, features of right heart failure may be present. Patients with PH-CHD with reversal of the shunt may demonstrate mild or moderate cyanosis. Some patients may experience desaturation or cyanosis with exercise. Most patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have central cyanosis and clubbing involving all extremities equally; however, the pattern and degree of cyanosis and clubbing depend upon the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamic status and cardiac anatomy. Clinical deterioration may occur during general anesthesia, lung infections, development of arrhythmias, and when ascending to altitude.

Echocardiography can generally determine the underlying CHD lesion, provide an estimate of PAP using continuous wave Doppler, suggest clues about the pathophysiology of PH, and provide prognostic features.</p><p>Echocardiographic findings in PH-CHD include increased right ventricular wall thickness (right ventricular hypertrophy), right atrial enlargement, and increased tricuspid and pulmonary valve regurgitation velocities. </p><p>An intracardiac shunt may be present but difficult to visualize by standard two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging due to equalization of pressures between chambers and bidirectional shunting. Echocardiographic imaging following an agitated saline injection is recommended for all patients with a new diagnosis of PH to exclude an intracardiac shunt such as an occult atrial septal defect (ASD) as a contributing factor. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can be easily missed using standard echo-Doppler and agitated saline injection. Clues to the diagnosis include differential clubbing and cyanosis, low velocity bidirectional flow in the region of the PDA, and the presence of agitated saline in the descending thoracic aorta.</p><p>In patients with advanced PH-CHD, right heart failure occurs and can result in right ventricular systolic dysfunction and progressive right heart enlargement with secondary tricuspid and pulmonary valve regurgitation. The presence of a pericardial effusion suggests advanced PH with high right atrial pressure and reduced survival; however, these findings have not been specifically identified as high-risk features in PH-CHD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Echo-Doppler features have been described to help determine the etiology of PH in non-CHD patients such as left atrial dilation, and restrictive left heart filling parameters seen in pulmonary venous hypertension.

Although frequently used, these echo-Doppler parameters have not been validated in CHD patients. </p><p>A transesophageal echocardiogram may provide additional important anatomic information when the TTE images are not technically sufficient to identify the structural and functional abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Intracardiac shunts may be very difficult to identify by TTE.

Both CT and CMR imaging allow assessment of cardiac anatomy, assessment of pulmonary artery size, and quantification of right ventricular size and function. Occasionally, compression of a coronary artery has been described in a PH-CHD patient; this may be identified by CT, CMR, or coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults-with-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. CT is generally preferred over CMR for patients with PH-CHD, since CT angiography may better identify thromboembolic disease and pulmonary artery anomalies than CMR. High-resolution CT imaging with lung windows can also be added to screen for lung pathology. Serial CT and CMR imaging are not routinely performed in PH-CHD patients. Follow-up cross-sectional imaging frequency is individualized and depends on underlying CHD and associated lesions.
