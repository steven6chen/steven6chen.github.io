A 2004 report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute defined CRS as a condition in which therapy to relieve congestive symptoms of HF is limited by a decline in renal function as manifested by a reduction in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reduction in GFR was initially thought to result from a reduction in renal blood flow. However, various studies have demonstrated that cardiorenal interactions occur in both directions and in a variety of clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H49850194\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p>The different interactions that can occur led to the following classification of CRS that was proposed by Ronco and colleagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 (acute) &ndash; Acute HF results in acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 &ndash; Chronic cardiac dysfunction (eg, chronic HF) causes progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD, previously called chronic renal failure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 &ndash; Abrupt and primary worsening of kidney function due, for example, to renal ischemia or glomerulonephritis causes acute cardiac dysfunction, which may be manifested by HF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 &ndash; Primary CKD contributes to cardiac dysfunction, which may be manifested by coronary disease, HF, or arrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 5 (secondary) &ndash; Acute or chronic systemic disorders (eg, sepsis or diabetes mellitus) that cause both cardiac and renal dysfunction.</p><p/><p>The prevalence of impaired renal function in patients with HF, the diagnosis of CRS, and the mechanisms by which acute HF leads to worsening kidney function (type 1 CRS) will be reviewed here. However, it may be difficult to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 CRS (chronic HF), and similar mechanisms may apply to type 2. Issues related to the prognosis and treatment of type 1 or 2 CRS are presented separately.

Approximately 30 percent had a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (defined as a serum creatinine greater than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>.

In different series, approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients developed an increase in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/11,12,14,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14,16,18</a>], and, in one report, 24 percent had an increase of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Risk factors for worsening kidney function during admission for HF include a prior history of HF or diabetes, an admission serum creatinine of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or higher, and uncontrolled hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,21</a>]. The rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022657\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired kidney function in patients with heart failure (HF) is defined as a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The most common test used to estimate GFR is the serum creatinine concentration. However, older and sicker patients often have a reduction in muscle mass and therefore in creatinine production. Thus, the GFR may be substantially reduced in patients who have a serum creatinine that is in the normal range or only mildly elevated. Estimation equations are available that provide a better estimate of GFR than the serum creatinine alone by including known variables that affect the serum creatinine independent of GFR (eg, age, weight, sex). These equations require that the serum creatinine concentration be <strong>stable</strong>; they cannot be used to estimate GFR in a patient who has a rising serum creatinine. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with HF who have an elevated serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduced estimated GFR, it is important to distinguish between underlying kidney disease and impaired kidney function due to the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). This distinction may be difficult and some patients have both underlying chronic kidney disease and CRS. </p><p>Findings suggestive of underlying kidney disease include significant proteinuria (usually more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> an active urine sediment with hematuria with or without pyuria or cellular casts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> small kidneys on radiologic evaluation. However, a normal urinalysis, which is typically present in CRS without underlying kidney disease, can also be seen in variety of renal diseases including nephrosclerosis and obstructive nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease#H20001953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with newly identified chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The blood urea <span class=\"nowrap\">nitrogen/creatinine</span> ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(BUN/Cr)</span> is frequently used to aid in the differentiation of prerenal renal failure from intrinsic renal disease. An elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/Cr</span> ratio is typically suggestive of a prerenal etiology, as long as other causes of a high ratio (eg, increased urea production) are not present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood urea nitrogen/serum creatinine ratio'</a>). HF is a cause of prerenal azotemia, although evidence suggests that worsening renal function due to HF is not solely related to reduced cardiac output and frequently occurs in the setting of volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] (see <a href=\"#H49850194\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below): </p><p>In HF, an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/Cr</span> should not deter decongestive or diuretic therapies if evidence of clinical congestion is present.

A urine sodium concentration below 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> would be expected with HF, since renal perfusion is reduced with associated activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, both of which promote sodium retention. However, higher values may be seen with concurrent diuretic therapy if the measurement is made while the diuretic is still acting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-kidney-injury-among-hospitalized-adult-patients#H19997930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients&quot;, section on 'Urine sodium excretion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49850194\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors can contribute to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with heart failure (HF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/4,16,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,24,25</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66634 \">figure 1</a>). The major mechanisms that have been evaluated include neurohumoral adaptations, reduced renal perfusion, increased renal venous pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022664\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurohumoral adaptations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired left ventricular function leads to a number of hemodynamic derangements, including reduced stroke volume and cardiac output, arterial underfilling, elevated atrial pressures, and venous congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These hemodynamic derangements trigger a variety of compensatory neurohormonal adaptations, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increases in the release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), and endothelin-1 which promote salt and water retention and systemic vasoconstriction. These pathways lead to the disproportionate reabsorption of urea compared with that of creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,28</a>]. In the setting of HF, blood urea nitrogen therefore represents a surrogate marker of neurohormonal activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. These adaptations overwhelm the vasodilatory and natriuretic effects of natriuretic peptides, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/20,24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,31</a>]. </p><p>Neurohumoral adaptations can contribute to preservation of perfusion to vital organs (the brain and heart) by maintenance of systemic pressure via arterial vasoconstriction in other circulations, including the renal circulation, and by increasing myocardial contractility and heart rate. However, systemic vasoconstriction increases cardiac afterload, which reduces cardiac output, which can further reduce renal perfusion. The maladaptive nature of these adaptations is evidenced by the slowing of disease progression and reduction in mortality with the administration of angiotensin inhibitors and beta blockers in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blocker-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of angiotensin II receptor blocker in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022685\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced renal perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, an original definition described the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) as a disorder in which therapy to relieve congestive symptoms of HF (eg, loop diuretics) is limited by a reduction in GFR; the fall in GFR was thought to result from a decline in cardiac output of as much as 20 percent due to the reduction in ventricular preload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/3,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32</a>]. A similar reduction in renal perfusion may be induced by acute decompensated HF prior to treatment. However, some patients initially have little or no reduction in cardiac output with loop diuretic therapy because they are on the flat part of the Frank-Starling curve in which changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure have little or no effect on cardiac performance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58693 \">figure 2</a>), while others have an increase in GFR following diuretic therapy that may be mediated by a reduction in renal venous pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right ventricular dilatation.

There was no correlation between the cardiac index and either the baseline GFR or worsening kidney function, and increasing the cardiac index did not improve renal function after discharge. Similar findings were noted in another report in which HF patients with worsening kidney function did not have lower cardiac outputs or filling pressures than those without worsening kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 575 patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization in the randomized or registry portions of the ESCAPE trial, there was a weak but significant inverse correlation between cardiac index and estimated GFR (eGFR), such that higher cardiac index was paradoxically associated with worse eGFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Cardiac index was not associated with either BUN or the <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/Cr</span> ratio. </p><p/><p>It has been suggested that, although reductions in cardiac index lead to a reduction in renal blood flow, the GFR is initially maintained by an increase in the fraction of renal plasma flow that is filtered (ie, the filtration fraction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Increased pressure within a distended RV increases LV extramural pressure, reducing LV transmural pressure for any given intracavitary LV pressure and inducing leftward interventricular septal bowing, thereby diminishing LV preload and distensibility and reducing forward flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Endothelial dysfunction and a proinflammatory state have emerged as important mediators of cardiorenal interactions. Renal dysfunction can lead to metabolic derangements resulting in systemic inflammation and microvascular dysfunction, which can cause cardiomyocyte stiffening, hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In a study of patients with acute decompensated HFpEF, 38 (36 percent) of 104 subjects developed worsening renal function (WRF; increase in serum creatinine of &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> within 72 hours of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. While linear and volumetric measures of right atrial and right ventricular (RV) chamber size did not differ significantly between those patients with versus those without WRF, those with WRF had significantly reduced RV function and increased RV free wall thickness. Again, these associations do not prove causality between renal dysfunction and adverse RV remodeling and dysfunction.

In addition, both heart and kidney function can be impaired by an acute or chronic systemic disorder. The term &quot;cardiorenal syndrome&quot; (CRS) has been applied to these interactions. In type 1 CRS, acute heart failure (HF) leads to worsening kidney function. In type 2 CRS, chronic HF causes progressive chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H2022629\" class=\"local\">'Definition and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of moderate to severe kidney impairment (defined as a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) is approximately 30 to 60 percent in patients with HF. In addition to these baseline observations, patients undergoing treatment for acute or chronic HF frequently develop an increase in serum creatinine, which fulfills criteria for type 1 or type 2 CRS. (See <a href=\"#H61342639\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with HF who have an elevated serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduced estimated GFR, it is important to distinguish between underlying kidney disease and impaired kidney function due to the CRS. (See <a href=\"#H2022657\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of factors can contribute to a reduction in GFR in patients with HF. The major mechanisms that have been evaluated include neurohumoral adaptations, reduced renal perfusion, increased renal venous pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction.
