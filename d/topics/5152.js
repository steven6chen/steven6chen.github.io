As a result, males who inherit a G6PD mutation are hemizygous for the defect; all of their RBCs are affected.

The majority of females who inherit an abnormality in G6PD are unaffected carriers. However, the cells that express the abnormal allele are as vulnerable to hemolysis as the enzyme-deficient RBCs in males. The presence of anemia will vary depending on the severity of deficiency in the affected cells and whether there is skewed X-inactivation (lyonization) that results in a greater expression from the abnormal allele in a large percentage of RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for an abnormal <em>G6PD</em> gene has been reported in as many as 1 percent of American women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

These have been classified by the World Health Organization according to the magnitude of the enzyme deficiency and the severity of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This classification gives some approximation of the magnitude of hemolysis an individual might incur in the setting of an oxidative stress. Only class I, II, and III are of clinical significance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class I</strong> &ndash; Class I variants have severe enzyme deficiency (eg, &lt;10 percent of normal) associated with chronic hemolytic anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class II</strong> &ndash; Class II variants also have severe enzyme deficiency (&lt;10 percent of normal), but there is usually only intermittent hemolysis, typically on exposure to oxidant stress such as fava bean exposure or ingestion of certain drugs. G6PD Mediterranean is the classic example.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class III</strong> &ndash; Class III variants have moderate enzyme deficiency (10 to 60 percent of normal) with intermittent hemolysis, typically associated with significant oxidant stress. G6PD A<sup>-</sup> is the classic example.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class IV</strong> &ndash; Class IV variants have no enzyme deficiency or hemolysis. The wild-type (normal) enzyme is considered a class IV variant, as are numerous other genetic changes that do not alter levels of the enzyme. These variants are of no clinical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Class V</strong> &ndash; Class V variants have increased enzyme activity (more than twice normal). These are typically uncovered during testing for G6PD deficiency. They are of no clinical significance.</p><p/><p>Certain variants are seen more commonly in certain populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>G6PD Mediterranean</strong> &ndash; The G6PD Mediterranean variant (563C&gt;T) is the most common abnormal variant in Caucasians, particularly individuals from the Mediterranean region and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is a class II variant associated with severe hemolysis. The half-life of this variant is measured in hours. Thus, the majority of circulating RBCs have grossly deficient G6PD enzyme activity and will undergo hemolysis upon exposure to an oxidant injury. However, in the absence of oxidant stress, hemolysis typically does not occur and there is no anemia or reticulocytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>G6PD A</strong><strong><sup>-</sup></strong> &ndash; The G6PD A<sup>-</sup> variant <span class=\"nowrap\">(202G&gt;A/376A&gt;G)</span> is the most common variant in individuals of African ancestry. It is a class III variant associated with mild to moderate hemolysis as well as sensitivity to the antimalarial drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a>. The enzymatic activity of this variant is normal in reticulocytes, but it declines more rapidly than the normal enzyme (half-life, 13 days, compared with 62 days for the normal enzyme) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. As a result, only the oldest RBCs undergo hemolysis upon exposure to oxidant stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variants in Asians</strong> &ndash; Several different G6PD variants occur in Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In China, three major variants are recognized. The most common is G6PD Canton (1376G&gt;T), which is usually reported to be a class II variant, although sometimes it is considered to be in class III. Another common variant is G6PD Kaiping (1388G&gt;A), which is usually classified as a class III variant although occasionally considered to be in class II. A third variant is G6PD Gaohe (95A&gt;G), which is almost always considered to be a class II variant. These three variants account for over 70 percent of G6PD deficiency cases in China.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common variant in Southeast Asia is G6PD Mahidol (487G&gt;A), a class III variant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Of interest, although India borders China, none of the Chinese G6PD variants are found in India, where the most common type is G6PD Mediterranean (563C&gt;T).</p><p/><p>The genetics and pathophysiology of G6PD deficiency is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathophysiology of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency&quot;, section on 'Classification of G6PD variants'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical expression of G6PD deficiency encompasses a spectrum of disease severity. The severity of disease and the likelihood of developing neonatal jaundice or chronic hemolysis, and the magnitude of hemolysis when hemolytic episodes occur, depends on the degree of the enzyme deficiency, which in turn is determined by the characteristics of the G6PD variant. (See <a href=\"#H1547944238\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of individuals are asymptomatic and do not have hemolysis in the steady state. They have neither anemia, evidence of increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction, nor an alteration in blood morphology, although a modest shortening of RBC survival can be demonstrated by isotopic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This includes almost all individuals with the most prevalent G6PD variants, G6PD A<sup>-</sup> and G6PD Mediterranean. However, episodes of acute hemolysis with hemolytic anemia may be triggered by medications, certain foods, and acute illnesses, especially infections. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute hemolytic anemia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, individuals with severe disease (class I variants) may have chronic hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and chronic hemolysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In most cases, women who have inherited one abnormal G6PD allele are unaffected carriers. However, as noted above, women who inherit a class I mutation, or those with skewed lyonization, may have clinical disease. Women who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for an abnormal G6PD gene will have a similar phenotype as men. (See <a href=\"#H143332893\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hemolytic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals with G6PD deficiency have episodes of acute hemolysis in the setting of oxidant injury from medications, acute illnesses, and certain foods. Once patients are diagnosed and are able to reduce oxidant stress exposures through medication avoidance, the frequency of hemolysis may decline dramatically. Episodes of acute hemolysis are more common in individuals with G6PD Mediterranean, which has a half-life measured in hours, than with G6PD A<sup>-</sup>, which has a half-life measured in days.</p><p>G6PD-deficiency-associated hemolytic anemia can falsely lower the HbA1C level due to increased RBC turnover, as with other hemolytic anemias, but G6PD deficiency does not alter the HbA1C by mechanisms other than hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Sources of error'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H944810165\"><span class=\"h3\">Typical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical episode of hemolysis is illustrated by the course of an acute hemolytic episode following the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> to an individual with G6PD A<sup>-</sup>, the variant most commonly seen in individuals of African ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At two to four days after drug ingestion, there is the sudden onset of jaundice, pallor, and dark urine. There may be abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> back pain. Hemolysis may be mild and self-limiting in some individuals, and severe and life-threatening in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This is associated with an abrupt fall in the hemoglobin concentration by 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> during which time the peripheral blood smear reveals RBC fragments, microspherocytes, and eccentrocytes or &quot;bite&quot; cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>). Special stains can document the production of Heinz bodies, which are collections of denatured globin chains often attached to the RBC membrane. Hemolysis is both extravascular and intravascular. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants#H11446176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin precipitation and Heinz body formation'</a>.)</p><p>The anemia induces an appropriate stimulation of erythropoiesis, with an increase in reticulocytes that is apparent within five days and is maximal at 7 to 10 days after the onset of hemolysis. These reticulocytes and younger RBCs have the highest levels of G6PD activity, often sufficient to withstand the oxidative stress of ongoing drug exposure. As a result, the acute hemolytic process ends after about one week, with ultimate reversal of the anemia, even with continued drug ingestion.</p><p>More severe hemolysis may be seen in individuals with G6PD Mediterranean, the variant most commonly seen in individuals from Mediterranean countries and the Middle East, as well as in other class II variants (see <a href=\"#H1547944238\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). The anemia is more severe because a larger population of circulating RBCs is vulnerable to hemolysis, since the half-life of G6PD Mediterranean is shorter and fewer RBCs have sufficient G6PD activity to prevent oxidant injury. Hemolysis in these individuals may continue well after the drug is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of G6PD-deficient Asians is variable, depending whether the defect is a class II or III variant.

In a series of 102 patients with G6PD deficiency from 1966 that categorized 119 episodes of acute hemolysis, 46 (39 percent) were precipitated by a medication alone, and 73 (61 percent) appeared to be related solely to a concurrent illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications and chemicals</strong> &ndash; Medications that can precipitate hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254 \">table 1</a>) and on various websites (eg, <a href=\"http://www.g6pd.org/&amp;token=+Or/jS+StqFm4G6eiCMPkcv2OlD6ldgYv2Au1AcMfzY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4057\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.g6pd.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.g6pddeficiency.org/&amp;token=+Or/jS+StqFm4G6eiCMPkSeet5JxG70Va5hb8QFIuxJAQLdUiTjx0lcT78MKiHNw&amp;TOPIC_ID=4057\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.g6pddeficiency.org</a>).

Acute intravascular hemolysis upon ingestion of fava beans, referred to as favism, occurs most commonly in male children between the ages of one and five years.

Hemolysis can occur with a variety of organisms (eg, viral, bacterial, rickettsial) and sites of infection (eg, pneumonia, hepatitis). Hemolytic anemia associated with infections can range from mild and self-limited to severe enough to cause acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/33,41-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,41-48</a>]. In the series of patients from 1966, pneumonia was the most common inciting infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the setting of viral hepatitis, the combination of an increased bilirubin load from hemolysis and a damaged liver unable to process bilirubin as well as normal results in an exaggerated elevation in the serum bilirubin concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The factors responsible for accelerated destruction of G6PD-deficient RBCs during infection are not known. One possible explanation is that the cells are damaged by oxidants generated by phagocytic macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diabetic ketoacidosis has also been reported to precipitate hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, although one study of patients with the G6PD Mediterranean variant found no such correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/33,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,50,51</a>].

It has been presumed that the combination of increased bilirubin production due to accelerated breakdown of RBCs and the immaturity of the liver is responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/61,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,67,68</a>].

Variants that produce chronic hemolytic anemia are referred to as class I variants (see <a href=\"#H1547944238\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). These individuals have such severe G6PD deficiency that they may have hemolysis even in the absence of oxidant injury from medications or illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>].</p><p>These individuals may also be referred to as having congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The term nonspherocytic is somewhat of a misnomer, since these individuals may have spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear. However, this term is useful in distinguishing individuals with G6PD deficiency, in whom spherocytes are relatively infrequent at baseline, from those with hereditary spherocytosis, in whom spherocytes are abundant.

Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants.</p><p>The typically mild degree of anemia reflects the ability of increased erythropoiesis to compensate for the hemolysis. Thus, as with other chronic hemolytic anemias, the anemia may be worsened by diminished erythropoietic capacity due to infection or to parvovirus-induced aplastic crises.

In the setting of an acute hemolytic episode, the RBCs with the most severely reduced G6PD activity will have hemolyzed, and thus their G6PD activity will not be measured in the assay. This situation can produce false-negative results in some patients who are tested in the midst of a severe hemolytic episode.</p><p>False-negative results are most likely to occur in individuals who have populations of RBCs that are severely G6PD-deficient and RBCs that are not severely deficient, such as individuals of African ancestry, in whom G6PD activity declines gradually as RBCs age, and women, most of whom are heterozygous and have a mixture of normal and G6PD-deficient RBCs. False-negative results are also most likely to be seen during the period of initial reticulocytosis, when there is the highest proportion of reticulocytes, which typically have normal G6PD activity.</p><p>Thus, if initial testing is negative and a suspicion for G6PD deficiency remains, testing should be repeated approximately three months after the hemolytic episode has resolved (ie, the typical time it takes for a new population of circulating RBCs to be produced). During this three-month period, it would be prudent to avoid potential sources of oxidant injury.

Like G6PD deficiency, these can present with varying degrees of direct antiglobulin (Coombs)-negative hemolysis (with increased reticulocytes, decreased haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and anemia), and like G6PD deficiency, these may not be diagnosed until adulthood (or may be misclassified), especially if hemolysis is mild. Like many of these inherited disorders, G6PD deficiency is seen at greater frequency in populations from regions where malaria was once endemic, likely due to a protective effect. Unlike these other inherited hemolytic anemias, G6PD deficiency is characterized by low G6PD enzyme activity at baseline, and testing such as hemoglobin analysis, osmotic fragility, and band 3 flow cytometry will be normal in individuals with G6PD deficiency.

Like G6PD deficiency, these conditions may be associated with anemia and neonatal jaundice. Unlike G6PD deficiency, these conditions may be more likely to present with hyperbilirubinemia at birth (versus two to three days after birth for G6PD deficiency), and these other conditions are associated with normal G6PD enzyme activity.

This is usually straightforward once the diagnosis is known. However, there may be instances in which an oxidant drug is absolutely required, or cases in which oxidative stress comes from an infection or other acute medical condition that cannot be avoided. In these settings, management depends on the severity of hemolysis and anemia and the patient's age and comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346062506\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of neonatal jaundice and chronic hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of neonatal jaundice due to G6PD deficiency does not differ from that recommended for neonatal jaundice arising from other causes. Mild cases generally do not require treatment; intermediate cases require phototherapy; and severe cases may require exchange transfusion.

As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> has been given to individuals with the G6PD A<sup>-</sup> variant as long as a low dose is used (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or 45 mg once or twice weekly) and the complete blood count (CBC) is monitored closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The mild anemia that may ensue is corrected by the compensatory increase in reticulocyte production and does not recur unless the dose of the drug is escalated.</p><p>Data regarding dietary supplements and herbs are challenging to evaluate. In a 2016 systematic review of published reports, no evidence of harms were observed for vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, ginkgo biloba, or alpha-lipoic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. We neither prescribe nor proscribe any of these supplements for our G6PD-deficient patients. Just as for any questionable food, we ask our patients and their families to be observant of any changes suggestive of increased hemolysis (change in stamina, scleral icterus, dark [cola-colored] urine) associated with the use of supplements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4076907159\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary restrictions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has also been suggested that affected individuals should avoid ingestion of fava beans, also referred to as &quot;broad beans,&quot; which can cause hemolysis in some but not all affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. However, unlike certain medications that induce hemolysis in all individuals with G6PD deficiency, sensitivity to the fava bean is more variable.</p><p>The G6PD variant most commonly implicated in favism is G6PD Mediterranean and G6PD Canton. Thus, favism occurs most often in people from Italy, Greece, North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Africans and African-Americans with G6PD deficiency are much less susceptible, although there are very rare cases of favism associated with the African variant, G6PD A<sup>-</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. In addition, the response to the bean by the same individual at different times may not be consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Other genetic factors, perhaps related to the hepatic metabolism of potentially oxidant compounds within the fava bean, may play a role in determining the severity of the reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>].

Consequently, the peak seasonal incidence of favism in Mediterranean regions coincides with harvesting of the bean during April and May [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. However, equally severe hemolysis can occur after consuming fried fava beans, a popular Chinese snack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109970\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109970 \">picture 2</a>). Favism also has been reported in nursing infants whose mothers have eaten fava beans.</p><p>A question that often comes up relates to the safety of falafel, a common Middle Eastern food. The answer depends on the ingredients. Egyptian falafel is made from fava beans, whereas falafel made elsewhere in the world is usually made from chick peas, which are considered safe for people with G6PD deficiency. However, in some areas, falafel is made from a mixture of fava beans and chick peas. The easiest response to the question is that G6PD-deficient individuals should not consume anything with fava beans. However, since not everyone with G6PD deficiency, particularly adults, is sensitive to fava beans, we advise patients to use cautious observation.</p><p>Favism can also occur following ingestion of bitter melon. Also, several other foods such as blueberries are listed on the internet as potentially associated with hemolysis, although the direct relationship is not clear. In our practice we do not advise dietary restrictions; however, for any questionable food we emphasize to our patients and their families to be observant of any changes suggestive of increased hemolysis. Patients are encouraged to call their physician if any changes are noted.</p><p>The mechanism by which fava beans induce hemolysis may involve the pyrimidine metabolites divicine and isouramil (aglycones of the glucosides) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-105</a>]. These compounds act as strong reducing agents, which in the presence of oxygen form an unstable intermediate that oxidizes reduced glutathione. In G6PD-deficient red blood cells with diminished GSH-generating capacity this may have a direct effect on RBC function. In vitro studies have shown that divicine reduces the activity of catalase which, like the glutathione pathway, contributes to hydrogen peroxide removal, and requires NADPH for maintenance of normal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933326679\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant and nursing women who are heterozygous for G6PD deficiency should avoid drugs with oxidant potential, because some of these drugs gain access to the fetal circulation and to breast milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3133040842\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, donated blood is not screened for G6PD deficiency, and individuals with G6PD deficiency can donate blood, as long as they are otherwise able to donate and do not have anemia.
