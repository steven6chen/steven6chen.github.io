This typically results in splenomegaly and a variable reduction in the production of normal red blood cells, platelets, mature granulocytes, and monocytes. The increased production of malignant cells, along with a reduction in these mature elements, results in a variety of systemic consequences, including splenomegaly, anemia, bleeding, and an increased risk of infection.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of HCL will be reviewed here; treatment of this disorder is discussed separately.

Most cases of HCL are postulated to arise from a late, activated memory B cell that acquires a BRAF V600E gene mutation. The resultant aberrant activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway leads to a distinct phenotype and enhanced cell survival. (See <a href=\"#H18129837\" class=\"local\">'BRAF mutations'</a> below.) </p><p>Exposures to ionizing radiation, pesticides, and farming have been mentioned as possible causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Of these effects, enhanced cell survival (inhibition of apoptosis) is believed to be more important, since HCL has a very low proliferative index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Initial studies using sensitive molecular assays (eg, next generation sequencing, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction) identified the BRAF V600E mutation in the entire tumor clone of the vast majority of cases of classic HCL and in no cases of other peripheral B cell lymphomas or leukemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/14,15,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,18,20</a>].

These mutations coexisted with BRAF V600E mutations and were clonal, implying an early role in the pathogenesis of HCL. Another study identified mutations in KMT2C (MLL3) and CDKN1B in 15 and 11 percent of cases of classical HCL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, mutations in the transcription factor KLF2 were identified in 4 of 24 (16 percent) of HCL patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 15 of 31 (48 percent) cases of IGHV4-34 expressing HCL demonstrated mutations in the MAP2K1 gene which encodes MEK1, a downstream mediator in the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. IGHV4-34 expressing HCL do not exhibit the BRAF V600E mutation and have a more aggressive clinical course with high white cell count at presentation and suboptimal response to purine analog therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/18,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,36</a>].

In the United States, the estimated incidence is three cases per million persons per year, which equates to 600 to 800 new cases each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Due to its indolent course, the prevalence of HCL is much higher. </p><p>The median age at onset is 50 to 55 years. While HCL has been diagnosed in younger adults, it is almost never seen in children. There is a strong male predominance with a male:female ratio of approximately four to one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The incidence is approximately three times higher in Caucasians than in Blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting complaints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with HCL present with symptoms related to splenomegaly or cytopenias (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, monocytopenia), including weakness and fatigue, infections of variable severity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemorrhagic findings such as gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. Combinations of these symptoms are common. HCL can present to the clinician in a number of different ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-quarter presents with abdominal fullness or discomfort due to splenomegaly, which may be massive.

Case series report palpable splenomegaly in 80 to 90 percent of cases, with the splenic edge extending more than 8 cm below the left costal margin in 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,42</a>]. The incidence and severity of splenomegaly may be decreasing as patients are diagnosed earlier in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/39,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,51</a>]. </p><p>Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy are not major features of HCL, being present in approximately 20 and 10 percent of patients, respectively. B symptoms (ie, fevers, night sweats, weight loss) are usually not associated with HCL, and if fever is present it is likely indicative of a superimposed infection. </p><p>Rare physical findings include soft tissue infiltration, vasculitic skin rash, ascites, and pleural effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H28406699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sixty to 80 percent of patients with HCL present with pancytopenia, with hematocrits in the range of 20 to 35 percent, a total white blood cell count usually below <span class=\"nowrap\">4000/microL,</span> and platelet counts in the range of 20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/39,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,42</a>].

HCL cells can be identified in Romanowsky-stained peripheral blood films from approximately 90 percent of patients, where they usually comprise 20 percent or less of the total white blood cell count. However, in the 10 percent of patients who present with leukocytosis, the HCL cell is the predominant circulating white blood cell. A very small percent of patients present with marked leukocytosis, with white blood cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;200,000/microL</span>.</p><p>The HCL cell is a mononuclear cell that is usually one to two times the size of a mature lymphocyte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F102936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102936 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The nuclei are often eccentric in position, but may be central. The nuclei are most commonly ovoid, but may be round, oval, reniform, or horseshoe shaped. Atypical morphologic appearances are more frequent in hairy cell variant cases. The chromatin pattern is reticular or net-like in appearance; nucleoli are indistinct or absent.</p><p>The cytoplasm is variable in amount but usually fairly abundant, pale blue to blue-gray in color, and occasionally described as &quot;fluffy.&quot; The cytoplasmic outline is often indistinct due to the presence of varying numbers of projections, best seen on phase-contrast microscopy, giving the cell a &quot;hairy&quot; appearance when the projections are thin, and a &quot;ruffled&quot; appearance when they are wider. The hairy projections are readily evident on electron microscopic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and particularly on scanning electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85804256\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow (BM) is often difficult or impossible to aspirate (dry tap) due to HCL-induced marrow fibrosis and the interlocking cell borders of hairy cells. As such, the diagnosis relies heavily on analysis of peripheral blood and trephine biopsies. </p><p>The hairy cell nuclei are widely separated from each other by virtue of the cell's abundant cytoplasm, producing a halo or &quot;fried egg&quot; appearance in biopsy and tissue specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113336 \">picture 2</a>). Mast cells may be numerous. Extravasated red cells are frequently seen, and blood lakes similar to those observed in the spleen may also be present. Mitotic figures are uncommon and necrosis or apoptosis of tumor cells are absent.</p><p>The extent of involvement of the BM is usually best estimated by immunohistochemical staining of sections for B cell associated antigens such as CD20. Most cases have a hypercellular marrow, and hairy cell infiltration may be diffuse or interstitial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nodular patterns of marrow infiltration occur rarely, if at all. A minority of patients, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, exhibit a hypocellular BM. The hypocellularity may be so profound as to suggest marrow aplasia, with only small numbers of hairy cells infiltrating around fat cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/55-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-61</a>].</p><p>In patients with diffuse involvement, large areas of the BM may be completely effaced by hairy cells. In one study, as an example, the median percent bone marrow involvement was 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When the BM is focally involved, there is some preservation of fat and hematopoietic elements, the infiltrates are randomly situated and may include paratrabecular locations. </p><p>Staining of the BM trephine biopsy for reticulin almost always shows a moderate to marked increase in reticulin fibers. In some cases, the reticulin fibers appear to surround individual hairy cells and may extend into the adjacent, more normal appearing BM tissue. Osteosclerosis has been rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>].

The cords and sinuses of the red pulp are infiltrated by tumor cells. The tumor infiltrate is comprised of a monotonous population of medium-sized cells with clear cytoplasm that may have interlocking cell borders, producing a &quot;fried egg&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58853 \">picture 3</a>).

However, TRAP is a technically challenging cytochemical stain and, while sensitive for HCL, is not as specific as other markers that can be identified by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, which has made the use of TRAP staining obsolete.

CD103 is a member of the integrin family and is also present on mucosa-associated T cells and some activated lymphocytes.
