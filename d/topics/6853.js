Suppressing the viral load prevents the emergence of drug-resistant virus and disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, certain HIV-infected patients will experience virologic failure on their antiretroviral regimen. Such individuals require a detailed evaluation to determine the reason for failure and the best approach to achieve viral suppression. </p><p>The evaluation of the patient failing their antiretroviral regimen will be reviewed here. Selecting a new regimen is discussed elsewhere.

For individuals who were initially able to suppress their viral load, virologic failure is defined as a recurrence of viremia to <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;200&nbsp;copies/mL&nbsp;on</span> two consecutive measurements taken approximately one month apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, intermittent &quot;blips&quot; of low level viremia (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> are generally not associated with the emergence of drug-resistant virus; thus, intermittent viral blips should not prompt a change in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The clinical significance and management of persistent viremia in the range of 50 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> is less clear. We generally continue the current regimen with counseling to enhance adherence and to avoid drug-drug and drug-food interactions. However, in some cases (eg, patients who have continued difficulty adhering to a daily regimen), we change to a pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or consider a dolutegravir-containing regimen if they are not already on this class of drugs, to minimize the risk of emerging resistance. (See <a href=\"#H1667948753\" class=\"local\">'Assess medication adherence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9493325\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR VIROLOGIC FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virologic failure typically results from poor adherence to an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, or from drug-drug or drug-food interactions that impair absorption. Patients with virologic failure may or may not have drug-resistant virus. The risk of developing drug resistance depends, in part, upon the type of regimen (eg, one that contains an agent with a high versus low barrier to resistance), as well as the level of adherence. (See <a href=\"#H9493463\" class=\"local\">'Nonadherence'</a> below and <a href=\"#H45145135\" class=\"local\">'Poor absorption or altered metabolism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9493476\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>With the introduction of more potent antiretroviral agents, the risk of developing virologic failure to first- or second-line regimens has decreased. As an example, in a retrospective study of 13,165 patients who were initiated on a new regimen after an initial treatment failure, the crude incidence of a subsequent treatment failure significantly declined from 56 events per 100 person-years in 1996 to 16 events per 100 person-years in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>More detailed discussions of specific antiretroviral agents are found elsewhere.

Those with detectable viremia and very low levels of adherence (eg, those not taking any medications) typically have a lower risk of developing resistance compared with patients who have intermediate levels of adherence. On occasion, a patient can develop drug-resistant virus despite excellent adherence; such individuals may have had drug-resistant virus prior to treatment initiation (ie, transmitted drug resistance) that was not detected by standard assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient#H1195505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Considerations prior to initiating treatment'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient admits to difficulties with adherence, potential barriers include the number and timing of doses, the size of the pills, and the presence of treatment-limiting side effects. Other barriers include depression, substance abuse, and housing instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Poor absorption can result from drug-drug interactions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a> administered with a proton pump inhibitor) or drug-food interactions (eg, rilpivirine administered without a meal). It can also result from underlying medical conditions that result in malabsorption. (See <a href=\"#H9493726\" class=\"local\">'Assess for poor absorption or altered metabolism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9493476\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop virologic failure are likely to develop drug resistance mutations to agents with a low genetic barrier to resistance (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elvitegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>). The spectrum of drug resistance in an individual patient can range from minimal resistance that affects the activity of one or two drugs (eg, the M184V mutation associated with resistance to lamivudine or emtricitabine), to multidrug resistance that includes resistance to several drug classes (eg, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> integrase strand transfer inhibitors). However, the risk of developing multidrug-resistant virus is much lower than in the past due to simpler regimens that are well tolerated, and are less likely to induce drug resistance mutations.

This evaluation is best performed when a patient is on treatment, since this allows the most accurate assessment of drug resistance mutations. However, certain individuals will present off treatment, and the initial evaluation depends primarily upon the patient&rsquo;s prior treatment history and information from past records. (See <a href=\"#H1667948501\" class=\"local\">'Patients who present off treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9493584\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who present on treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667948753\"><span class=\"h3\">Assess medication adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If failure is confirmed, we first evaluate if the patient is taking their medication correctly.

(See <a href=\"#H1667948759\" class=\"local\">'Assess for drug resistance'</a> below.) </p><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring is rarely performed in patients with virologic failure since the reproducibility of these methods is highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If such testing is obtained (eg, in the setting of complicated drug-drug interactions, pregnancy), the results should be interpreted with expert guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667948759\"><span class=\"h3\">Assess for drug resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing to assess for drug resistance should be done while the patient is on their failing regimen, or within the first four weeks of discontinuing treatment. In the absence of drug pressure, resistance testing is less accurate and low levels of resistant virus cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Genotypic testing is the preferred drug resistance assay for patients with virologic failure while taking their first or second regimen. These assays can detect mutations in the coding regions for HIV reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease that have been associated with drug resistance. Genotypic testing is readily available and relatively inexpensive compared with phenotypic assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional resistance tests may be needed to assess those with multiple mutations since interpretation becomes more complex with an increasing number of mutations, especially to PIs. In addition, standard genotype tests do not always evaluate for integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance, so if appropriate, this must be specifically requested. (See <a href=\"#H11612445\" class=\"local\">'Additional resistance testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667948501\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who present off treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, a patient will present off treatment for many months with a reported history of treatment failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug-resistant virus. </p><p>In general, resistance testing should not be performed when the patient is off therapy, particularly for more than four weeks, since it is possible that resistant virus that is present will not be detected. If testing is done and resistance mutations are detected, it does provide some information about what resistant virus may exist; however, it does not exclude other mutations. There has been increasing interest in the use of use of a proviral DNA assay that detects the presence of archived resistance mutations. However, the utility of the test in clinical practice has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays#H4107900689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;, section on 'HIV-1 proviral DNA assays'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, we do everything possible to get previous medical records and laboratory results, including drug resistance testing. If this information is not readily available, we initiate an antiretroviral regimen and then monitor the response to therapy. If a patient experiences a poor virologic response (&lt;1 log decrease in viral load in the first month or viral load&gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> by 12 to 24 weeks), resistance testing should then be performed while the patient is on therapy. </p><p>The choice of regimen and frequency of monitoring depends upon prior records and the treatment history:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If detailed records are available, we choose a regimen based upon the prior treatment history and the results of resistance testing.

For most patients, we prefer ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> with a first-line dual NRTI combination (eg, tenofovir-emtricitabine). This regimen is unlikely to quickly select for resistance mutations beyond those that had been previously selected for.

Such patients are unlikely to have virus with PI resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has previously used a non-pharmacologically-boosted PI, there is an increased risk of PI resistance. Thus, we monitor these individuals more closely compared with those who have never taken a non-pharmacologically-boosted PI, and perform viral load testing every four weeks. We also provide frequent monitoring if the prior PI experience is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For those who are unable to take a first-line NRTI combination (eg, secondary to comorbid condition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reported history of toxicity), we administer a regimen that includes a pharmacologically-boosted PI and an INSTI. We generally prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> rather than other INSTIs since it appears to have a higher barrier to resistance than the other drugs in the class. However, this regimen is a less desirable option for patients with a history of prior INSTI treatment in the past where the extent of resistance is not known. In this setting, dolutegravir should be dosed twice daily and the virologic response monitored closely (every four weeks). </p><p/><p>A detailed discussion of how to select an antiretroviral regimen for patients with drug-resistant virus is found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who become HIV-infected while taking PrEP should have genotype testing performed to assess for drug resistance. An ART regimen can then be determined based upon the results. Although most have virus that is not resistant to antiretroviral agents, others will develop drug-resistant virus. If drug resistance is present, patients should be treated the same way as those failing an initial regimen.

This issue is particularly important in the patient experiencing virologic failure where the initial lack of success may have resulted from poor adherence.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays#H757872852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;, section on 'Phenotypic resistance assays'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tropism Assay</strong> &#9472; A tropism assay is required if a CCR5 antagonist (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maraviroc</a>) is being considered as a possible agent since maraviroc only inhibits CCR5-utilizing virus (R5 virus). CCR5 antagonists should <strong>not</strong> be used for patients who have detectable CXCR4-using virus (X4 virus) (ie, those who are reported as X4 or <span class=\"nowrap\">dual/mixed</span> tropic). Most validated assays assess phenotypic tropism, but there are increasing data demonstrating the utility of genotypic tropism testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing-assays#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of HIV drug resistance testing assays&quot;, section on 'Tropism assays'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11612510\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiretroviral medication history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to obtaining a resistance test at the time of virologic failure, we review the patient&rsquo;s past antiretroviral treatment history and prior resistance results. This information is important when choosing a new regimen for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to choosing a new regimen depends, in part, upon whether or not a patient is failing their initial regimen or if they have failed multiple regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy#H344740781\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;, section on 'Patients failing their initial regimen'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy#H180580730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;, section on 'Patients who have failed multiple regimens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance mutations that are present at one point in time may not be seen on subsequent tests. These &quot;archived&quot; mutations can still limit the activity of future regimens. As an example, a patient who had a change in regimen because of a resistant virus five years ago may now present with a different mutation pattern given the selective pressures of their current regimen. In this case, the clinician must take into consideration the earlier mutations, which are still present as a minority viral population, even though they may not be detected with the most recent resistance testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For certain drugs, treatment history alone will predict HIV susceptibility. As an example, it should be assumed that documented virologic failure while taking drugs with a low barrier to resistance (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, T-20, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, and INSTIs other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>) has selected for resistance to these agents. This was illustrated in studies evaluating T-20, where this agent demonstrated excellent activity in those who were treatment-na&iuml;ve to T-20, but had suboptimal activity in those who had experienced viral rebound or persistent viremia while taking this drug in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9494061\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient related factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of certain comorbid conditions can impact which agents a specific patient should receive. These include factors such as renal insufficiency, active hepatitis B viral infection, heart disease, and if considering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a>, the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele. A more detailed discussion of how comorbid conditions impact the choice of an antiretroviral agent is found elsewhere. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3219223127\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

For individuals who were initially able to suppress their viral load, virologic failure is defined as a recurrence of viremia to &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> on two consecutive measurements taken approximately one month apart. (See <a href=\"#H9493488\" class=\"local\">'Virologic failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virologic failure typically results from poor adherence to an antiretroviral regimen, or from drug-drug or drug-food interactions that impair absorption. Patients with virologic failure may or may not have drug-resistant virus. (See <a href=\"#H9493325\" class=\"local\">'Reasons for virologic failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After virologic failure is confirmed, the initial assessment focuses on why the patient is failing their regimen and if drug-resistant virus is present. This evaluation is best performed when a patient is on treatment since this allows the most accurate assessment of drug resistance mutations. (See <a href=\"#H1667948784\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On occasion, a patient will present off treatment for many months with a reported history of treatment failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug-resistant virus. In this setting, we do everything possible to obtain medical records. When this is not possible, we initiate an antiretroviral regimen and then monitor the response to therapy. For such patients, we typically prefer a pharmacologically-boosted protease inhibitor with a nucleoside combination. If a patient experiences a poor virologic response, resistance testing can then be performed while the patient is on therapy in order to define the extent of resistance to these classes of drug. (See <a href=\"#H1667948501\" class=\"local\">'Patients who present off treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with drug-resistant virus will require a change in their regimen to achieve sustained viral suppression. To determine which agents are most likely to result in virologic suppression, some patients may need additional testing (eg, drug resistance phenotype and tropism testing). In addition, the patient&rsquo;s treatment history and underlying comorbidities (eg, kidney, cardiovascular disease, concurrent infections, and mental health disorders) can impact which antiretroviral agents to use.
