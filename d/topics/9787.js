A segmental left colectomy is performed when lesser resections are indicated (eg, trauma, polyp), provided the anastomosis is performed in well-vascularized bowel.</p><p>The techniques used to perform left colectomy are reviewed here. Right and extended right colectomy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right and extended right colectomy: Open technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20137418\"><span class=\"h1\">COLON ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The colon and rectum occupy the retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal spaces, in close approximation to solid organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60998 \">figure 1</a>). The ascending and descending colon are retroperitoneal, while the transverse colon, which extends from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, is intraperitoneal. The sigmoid colon continues from the descending colon, ending where the teniae converge to form the rectum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95933378\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial supply of the left colon has few profuse anastomoses and collateral circulations. The middle colic artery (MCA) and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) provide the principle blood supply to the left colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 2</a>). The marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan provide collateral blood vessels. Typically, the blood supply of the transverse colon is excellent provided the marginal artery is not damaged. Variability in the arterial anastomoses occurs, which is an important point when performing a segmental resection. The two most tenuous sites and the corresponding arterial supplies are the splenic flexure (Griffith's point) and distal descending colon (Sudeck's point). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190363137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intestinal vascular anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95928469\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous and lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venous drainage of the left colon is through the inferior mesenteric vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 3</a>). The lymphatic drainage flows along the left colic artery and the sigmoid vessels to the inferior mesenteric vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20137244\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General issues regarding the medical preparation of patients, including antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation, and other considerations, such as anticipated splenectomy, prior to colon resection are reviewed separately. Siting for possible ostomy locations should be performed prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H149209082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion#H21063010\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical ostomy for fecal diversion&quot;, section on 'Site selection and marking'</a>.)</p><p>It is helpful to have a flexible colonoscope available in the operating room, as it may be needed to identify a cancer or other mucosal lesion if it cannot be palpated.</p><p>We prefer that the patient is placed in lithotomy position, though the procedure can also be performed supine. Lithotomy allows simultaneous access to the abdomen and perineum for the colorectal anastomosis when using the circular stapler, as well as for intraoperative colonoscopy or proctoscopy. It also provides additional space for the second assistant and an additional position for the operating surgeon when mobilizing the splenic flexure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20139053\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for a left hemicolectomy include benign conditions (eg, segmental Crohn's colitis, trauma, ischemia, polyps unresectable through a colonoscope) and malignant diseases (eg, distal transverse colon cancer, mid-descending colon cancers). Diverticular disease, typically treated with a sigmoid colon resection, may require a left hemicolectomy if the descending colon is unsuitable for an anastomosis due to active diverticulitis or muscular hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H149208780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Indications for colon resection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95933462\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL EXPLORATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to proceeding with colon resection, the abdomen should be systematically explored. The anatomy of the colon and its blood supply should be verified, noting any anatomic variations or possibly any congenital anomalies (eg, malrotation). For patients with abdominal trauma, the abdomen is packed and systematically examined, removing the packs in turn. Bleeding is controlled first followed by control of gastrointestinal leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H197204297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic gastrointestinal injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Abdominal exploration'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with colon tumors, the primary tumor is palpated to confirm its location. Local and regional resectability is determined by assessing tumor invasion into the stomach, major vessels, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60998 \">figure 1</a>). The entire colon should also be palpated to identify synchronous colonic lesions. Abdominal exploration also includes an assessment for distant disease, including peritoneal implants, hepatic metastases, or distant nodal metastases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137217060\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENT OF RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of surgery is based upon the location of the lesion, disease process (benign versus malignant), blood supply, and venous and lymphatic drainage of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H644995072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Benign versus malignant disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137217092\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign lesions may be resected with a hemicolectomy or a segmental resection. As an example, extensive benign lesions of the left colon (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease) can be removed with a less extensive colon resection than is required for a cancer operation, providing the anastomosis is performed in well vascularized bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65664 \">figure 5</a>). For well-defined benign conditions of the left colon (eg, trauma, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease), a segmental resection with a primary anastomosis in well-vascularized colon and a limited mesenteric resection can be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54427\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54427 \">figure 6</a>). Resection margins must be chosen to ensure adequate blood supply in the remaining colon. For large polyps that require a surgical resection because of a possible malignancy, the authors perform a formal cancer operation.</p><p>Malignant lesions of the left colon are typically resected with a left hemicolectomy, extending from the distal transverse colon to the upper rectum, 2 to 3 cm above the sacral promontory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53859\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53859 \">figure 7</a>). For malignant lesions of the splenic flexure, a limited resection extending from the transverse to the sigmoid colon can be performed, but the pedicle of the left colic artery and the first sigmoid branch must be included (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75381\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75381 \">figure 8</a>). The proximal and distal colon segments are divided with a minimum of 5 cm margin of normal colon. The anastomosis is intraperitoneal between well-vascularized colon segments; the presacral plane posterior to the rectum is not entered. </p><p>In the uncommon setting of the detection of an unsuspected synchronous colonic cancer, we perform a subtotal colectomy to remove both lesions, including adequate resection margins with high ligation of mesenteric vessels and complete nodal harvest. Surgical management of synchronous metastatic disease (stage IV) is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H149213700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Synchronous colon cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locoregional methods for management and palliation in patients who present with stage IV colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137217188\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesentery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of the mesenteric resection also varies according to the indication for surgery. As an example, when performing the resection for malignant lesions, the inferior mesenteric artery is ligated at its origin from the aorta, the inferior mesenteric vein is ligated at the level of the pancreas, and the mesentery and draining lymphatics are removed with the vascular pedicle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H644995072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Benign versus malignant disease'</a>.)</p><p>A less extensive resection of the mesentery is performed for benign conditions, with the mesenteric vessels ligated closer to the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F98812\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98812 \">figure 9</a>). However, for settings of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and thickening of the mesentery near the bowel wall, mesenteric dissection may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H137217225\"><span class=\"h2\">Omentum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The omentum is divided from the transverse colon for most resections. However, when the omentum is involved with a left transverse colon cancer, it must be resected en bloc. The omentum is divided between the colon and the gastroepiploic arcade along the greater curvature of the stomach tying off the epiploic branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689 \">figure 10</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920625\"><span class=\"h1\">MOBILIZING THE LEFT COLON</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two approaches to resecting the left colon, one begins laterally by mobilizing the colon and progresses medially, while the other begins medially by identifying the lymphovascular bundle and progresses laterally. The approach is at the discretion of the surgeon, although in most settings the lateral-to-medial approach is performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95928534\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral-to-medial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral to medial approach begins by mobilizing the left colon by dividing the lateral peritoneal attachment of the colon and developing the retromesenteric plane. This approach provides early identification and exposure of the ureter and gonadal vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54111 \">figure 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65876\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65876 \">figure 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77687 \">figure 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56743\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56743 \">figure 14</a>) and can be used to resect malignant and benign diseases of the left colon. </p><p>The general principles for performing a left hemicolectomy, beginning with mobilizing the left colon, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retract the small bowel medially to expose the left colon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retract the left colon medially and incise the peritoneal attachments in the left paracolic gutter just medial to the line of Toldt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69062\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69062 \">figure 15</a>)at the level of the sigmoid colon. A bloodless plane is entered as the mesocolon is lifted away from the investing retroperitoneal fascia, which is left intact. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and avoid injury to the left ureter and gonadal vessels in the retroperitoneum. If the ureter cannot be seen, the dissection plane may be too deep. Check medially under the reflected peritoneum, as the ureter may have been lifted anteriorly with the investing retroperitoneal fascia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incise the peritoneum to the level of the splenic flexure. The peritoneal incision now follows the curve of the colon, remains inferomedial to the spleen, and continues around the corner of the flexure. Divide splenocolic ligaments with scissors or electrocautery to prevent tearing the splenic capsule. An alternative approach for obese patients with a thick mesentery or in settings where it is technically difficult to mobilize the splenic flexure is to approach the splenic flexure medially from the midtransverse colon and the dissection continued laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81638 \">figure 16</a>). For patients with a high splenic flexure, the optimal approach is to mobilize the apex stepwise, alternating the mobilization from the distal transverse colon and proximal descending colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotate the left colon medially to identify the renocolic ligament and divide with scissors or electrocautery to release the mesocolon from Gerota's fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56301 \">figure 17</a>). Elevating the ligaments over an index finger can facilitate the dissection. Small bleeding points can be cauterized or ligated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lift the omentum and left transverse colon to create tension on their fusion plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66463%7ESURG%2F75897%7ESURG%2F61843\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66463 graphicRef75897 graphicRef61843 \">figure 18A-C</a>). Use electrocautery to divide the omentum from the epiploica and the superior leaf of the transverse mesocolon. This maneuver permits entry into the lesser sac behind the stomach &#160; Dissect medially, separating the omentum from the colon to the middle colic vessels. There should be minimal bleeding when the dissection is performed in the correct plane. Avoid placing the mesocolon under tension by dissecting the reflected edge of the mesocolon as it is lifted off the retroperitoneum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continue mobilizing the left colon until it is completely free from its retroperitoneal attachments and suspended entirely on its mesentery near the midline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incise the medial aspect of the mesocolon from the level of the duodenum to the sacral promontory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and clear the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) of local tissue at its origin from the aorta without injuring the preaortic sympathetic nerves. Doubly ligate the IMA with an absorbable (eg, 0 or 2-0 polyglycolic or polyglactin) or nonabsorbable suture (eg, 0 or 2-0 silk), depending on the surgeon's discretion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and clear the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) of local tissue as it passes behind the duodenal jejunal junction. Doubly ligate the IMV with an absorbable or nonabsorbable suture as done for the IMA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divide the mesentery with an electrosurgical or alternative energy device (eg, LigaSure, Harmonic scalpel) or sharply divide and ligate with suture ties, depending on surgeon's preference and availability of equipment. Advanced electrosurgical devices are faster and can seal vessels up to 7 mm in diameter, including the pedicles, but are more costly. Avoid tension to ensure a complete vessel seal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;, section on 'Advanced electrosurgical devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;, section on 'Alternative energy sources'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Score the mesorectum with electrocautery, clamp and divide the tissue perpendicular to the axis of the bowel between clamps, and secure with 2-0 absorbable suture. Alternatives to the clamp and divide technique include the pinch-burn technique (grasp tissue with forceps and apply electrocautery until vessels are sealed and tissue divided), LigaSure technique, and harmonic scalpel. The mesocolon of the proximal bowel is prepared in a similar fashion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divide the proximal and distal bowel between two noncrushing bowel clamps (eg, Doyen intestinal clamp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61745 \">picture 1</a>) if performing a hand-sewn anastomosis, or between a transverse bowel clamp and linear stapler if performing a stapled anastomosis. The remaining colon must be well vascularized, pulses must be palpated in the last arcade, and the cut bowel edges must bleed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95928541\"><span class=\"h2\">Medial to lateral approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medial-to-lateral approach is ideal when a tumor is large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adherent to the lateral side wall. The advantage of the medial approach includes early ligation of the lymphovascular pedicle, which lessens the risk of injury as a result of torsion during colon mobilization. Early vascular ligation also allows demarcation between ischemic and well-perfused bowel prior to transecting the bowel, and more efficient identification of the resection plane in the setting of severe mesenteric inflammation (eg, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease). </p><p>The general principles for performing a left hemicolectomy, beginning with the ligation of the inferior mesenteric vessels, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expose the root of the mesenteric vessels by lifting the small bowel medially and superiorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incise the peritoneum 1 to 2 cm distal to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery while placing the sigmoid and descending colon under gentle tension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61892\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61892 \">figure 19</a>). Extend the peritoneal incision along the sulcus to the sacral promontory.

An alternative anastomosis that can be used between the proximal and distal colon (not rectum) is the functional end-to-end anastomosis, which is technically a side-to-side approach. There is insufficient evidence that any one configuration is better functionally or less likely to leak, or that a stapled colorectal anastomosis is superior to a hand-sewn one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The decision is based upon surgeon experience, preference, and available equipment.

While two-layer closures were routinely performed in the past, a randomized trial of 132 patients undergoing an intestinal anastomosis found that the single-layer closure was associated with similar complication rates for anastomotic leaks (two [3.0 percent] versus one patient [1.5 percent]) and intra-abdominal abscesses (two patients each) compared with a two-layer closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-colectomy-open-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].
