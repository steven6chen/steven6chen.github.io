(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The larynx is divided into three anatomic regions: the supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58555%7EONC%2F72411\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58555 graphicRef72411 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Glottic, supraglottic, and subglottic cancers represent approximately two-thirds, one-third, and two percent of laryngeal cancers, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This division is incorporated into staging the primary tumor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraglottis &ndash; suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds (laryngeal aspect), arytenoids, and ventricular bands (false cords)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glottis &ndash; true vocal cords, including anterior and posterior commissures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subglottis &ndash; subglottis, extending from lower boundary of the glottis to the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage</p><p/><p>By definition, patients with early laryngeal cancer have stage I or II tumors, with no evidence of thyroid cartilage invasion or lymph node involvement. </p><p>Careful, indirect, flexible or rigid laryngoscopy is essential for staging early larynx cancer because the staging, treatment, and functional outcomes after treatment depend more on function than simple anatomic extent of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with early laryngeal cancer should be treated with the intent to preserve the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The larynx performs three vital functions: maintenance of airway patency, occlusion of the airway during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, and voice production. Optimal treatment maximizes these functional outcomes (ie, voice quality, swallowing ability) and survival.</p><p>Both radiation therapy (RT) and laryngeal preservation surgery can cure a high proportion of patients with early stage disease. Five-year disease-specific survival rates with both approaches are above 90 percent for stage I disease and around 80 percent for stage II tumors, based upon observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>RT is often preferred because functional outcomes, particularly voice quality, are perceived to be better. A randomized trial that compared RT with laser surgery in 60 men with stage I disease found that patients treated with RT reported less hoarseness-related inconvenience two years after treatment than those treated with laser surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were no differences in oncologic outcomes. However, overall voice quality ratings of the two groups were similar, indicating that transoral endoscopic surgery may offer equivalent voice quality for appropriately selected patients. There were no differences in oncologic outcomes.</p><p>Chemotherapy alone does not have a role in the management of early stage laryngeal cancer outside of a clinical trial setting. Only uncommon and highly selected patients with T2 cancers (eg, bulky, invasive T2 cancers with impaired cord mobility) may be appropriate for concurrent chemoradiation. More commonly, larger T2 cancers are treated with <span class=\"nowrap\">intensified/altered</span> fractionation RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Total laryngectomy is only rarely indicated for stage I and stage II laryngeal cancer and should be reserved for salvage when no other meaningful option exists.</p><p>Although total laryngectomy is a straightforward surgical procedure that can eradicate tumor confined to the cartilaginous boundaries of the larynx, loss of the natural voice and the stigma, life style, and voice restrictions of a permanent stoma make it a procedure that patients fear. Although different options for voice rehabilitation exist, many patients express dissatisfaction with the results; social isolation, job loss, and depression are common sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Most patients with T1-2 cancers are treated with single-modality RT.</p><p>However, local recurrence following RT may require surgical salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although some patients can be salvaged with larynx-preserving procedures, total laryngectomy is necessary in more than one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, surgical resection following RT has a higher risk of wound complications than similar surgery in the unirradiated neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiation dermatitis, hoarseness, and painful or difficulty swallowing (odynophagia, dysphagia) commonly develop during the course of RT, but these acute toxicities typically resolve in two to eight weeks and are generally mild (grade 1 and 2). Patients with early stage laryngeal cancer are less likely to have prolonged acute, subacute, and permanent toxicity than patients with advanced laryngeal cancer who require larger RT fields and concurrent chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, prolonged edema of the larynx, soft tissue necrosis leading to chondritis, laryngeal stenosis, and pharyngeal stenosis can occasionally occur, even in patients with early stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

The goal is to minimize toxicities, including radiation exposure to uninvolved portions of the laryngopharynx and carotid arteries. Preliminary studies have reported encouraging results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], although this is not yet currently a widely used RT technique.</p><p>RT techniques, including dose and schedule, are discussed elsewhere.

Larynx-preserving surgery should be undertaken only when the surgeon is confident that tumor-free margins can be obtained because postoperative RT may compromise functional outcomes, particularly after open surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Transoral laser surgery is a minimally invasive technique, which combines suspension laryngoscopy with an operating microscope, microsurgical instruments, and a carbon dioxide laser (which is used because its frequency of light is absorbed by water, thus minimizing tissue damage). The tumor is transected, revealing the depth of invasion and allowing visualization of tumor margins, and removed piecemeal through the laryngoscope. At least one mobile arytenoid complex must be preserved so that function of the larynx is maintained. More recently, a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) has been used as an alternative to the carbon dioxide laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>If complete resection can be achieved, transoral laser surgery is often preferred over open partial laryngectomy in the treatment of early stage laryngeal cancer given the accumulating evidence of comparable efficacy with decreased morbidity and improved preservation of laryngeal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Transoral robotic surgery is also being developed as an approach for patients with early stage disease. Preliminary experience with transoral robotic surgery suggests that results are comparable to other techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Complications that can occur with open partial laryngectomy include infection, bleeding, laryngocutaneous fistula, airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy, aspiration pneumonia, and swallowing difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Transoral laser surgery has been associated with decreased morbidity, including the need for tracheostomy and nasogastric feeding, as well as lower costs and shorter hospital stays compared with partial laryngectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636379383\"><span class=\"h2\">Glottis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glottic (true vocal cord) cancer accounts for approximately two-thirds of all laryngeal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-i-and-ii-head-and-neck-cancer-the-larynx/abstract/4,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28</a>]. Most true vocal cord cancers occur on the anterior two-thirds of the cords, with a small percentage developing on the anterior commissure.</p><p>Persistent hoarseness, which is frequently the presenting complaint, tends to occur relatively early in the course of disease and causes glottic cancers to be discovered at an earlier stage than other head and neck cancers.

For those patients, accurate imaging evaluation of the anterior commissure is critical to ensure proper staging. For patients with adequately staged early disease involving the anterior commissure, RT is the appropriate treatment, and the details of radiation planning and delivery can be customized to assure an adequately high radiation dose to the region of interest.

Continued follow-up beyond five years is generally suggested because of the risk of late recurrence and for second primary malignancies, particularly in patients with significant smoking history. Imaging of the head and neck is not usually required; chest imaging (to assess for a second primary lung cancer) may be considered.

The optimal treatment maximizes both survival outcomes and functional consequences given the importance of maintaining laryngeal function (voice production, swallowing, and airway protection and patency). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For many patients with early stage cancers of the supraglottic and glottic larynx, we suggest RT rather than surgery because of better functional outcomes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, transoral laser (or robotic) surgery is a good option for patients with low-volume tumors not involving the anterior or posterior commissures. Larger tumors are often treated with RT (commonly intensified RT) as voice quality may be compromised with transoral laser surgery or open partial laryngectomy. (See <a href=\"#H636379383\" class=\"local\">'Glottis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient with an early stage cancer of the subglottic larynx, we suggest total laryngectomy or, for selected cases, partial laryngectomy, both also in conjunction with thyroidectomy and bilateral paratracheal node dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative is intensified RT, with the low neck and upper mediastinum included in the treatment fields. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Subglottis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend bilateral elective neck treatment, at minimum levels II through IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>), for early stage supraglottic cancer (with a clinically negative neck) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients with early stage glottic cancers with a clinically negative neck be managed with observation of the neck rather than elective neck treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

Postoperative concurrent chemoradiation may be preferable for positive margins or if a positive lymph node contains extracapsular extension.
