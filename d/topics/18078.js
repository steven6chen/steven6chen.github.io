For many years, surgical commissurotomy and valvuloplasty were the only available methods to correct TS. The development of balloon valvotomy techniques has revolutionized the management of mitral stenosis. Similar techniques can be used to treat TS, although data on treatment of TS are limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of TS and the management of patients with this lesion will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is most commonly of rheumatic etiology. The majority of cases of tricuspid rheumatic disease present with tricuspid regurgitation or a combination of regurgitation and stenosis; pure TS is very uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Rheumatic tricuspid disease almost never occurs as an isolated lesion, but is generally associated with mitral valve disease and, in some cases, aortic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In an angiographic study of 525 patients with rheumatic heart disease, 9 percent had TS and all patients with TS also had significant tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Other causes of flow obstruction at the level of the tricuspid valve include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital atresia or stenosis of the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

This gradient increases when blood flow across the tricuspid valve increases, as occurs with inspiration and exercise, and decreases when blood flow decreases, such as with expiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamics-of-valvular-disorders-as-measured-by-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, most patients with significant tricuspid stenosis have systemic venous congestion with jugular venous distension, ascites, and peripheral edema.

The resting cardiac output may be reduced and fails to increase with exercise. This may contribute to the only modestly elevated left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures seen when mitral valve disease is also present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759080270\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With tricuspid stenosis (TS), obstruction to tricuspid flow limits cardiac output, causes fatigue, and produces symptoms and signs of systemic venous hypertension. Aside from systemic venous congestion, the symptoms and signs in patients with TS depend largely upon the presence and severity of any associated mitral or aortic valve disease (particularly mitral stenosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H23709418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Chronic valve disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759080276\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with TS often complain of abdominal discomfort, which is due to hepatomegaly and hepatic congestion. Some patients may sense a fluttering discomfort in the neck, caused by tall &quot;a&quot; waves in the jugular venous pulse.</p><p>In the absence of mitral or aortic valve disease, findings caused by systemic venous hypertension are generally out of proportion to dyspnea. However, most patients with TS (particularly those with rheumatic heart disease) have significant mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Since these two lesions often coexist, the diagnosis of TS may be missed.</p><p>Obstruction to flow across the tricuspid valve produces an increase in right atrial and jugular venous pressure. Jugular venous pulsations often exhibit a prominent presystolic &quot;a&quot; wave, which may be confused with an arterial pulsation. The &quot;y&quot; descent is slow and barely appreciated. Kussmaul&rsquo;s sign (lack of decrease or a rise in jugular venous pressure with inspiration) may be seen. A jugular or clavicular presystolic click may be heard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical findings include jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly and hepatic pulsations, ascites, peripheral edema, and, occasionally, anasarca. </p><p>The lungs are clear in patients with isolated TS. Signs of pulmonary congestion are present in some patients with concurrent mitral valve disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>On auscultation, an opening snap of the tricuspid valve has been described but, when mitral stenosis is also present, it would be difficult to distinguish from the opening snap of mitral stenosis. The tricuspid opening snap usually follows the opening snap of the mitral valve and is localized to the lower left sternal border. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds#H43\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;, section on 'Tricuspid valve'</a>.)</p><p>A low frequency diastolic murmur is heard at the lower left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space; it is usually softer, higher pitched, and shorter in duration than the murmur of mitral stenosis. The intensity of the murmur and opening snap in TS increase with maneuvers that increase blood flow across the tricuspid valve, especially with inspiration (Carvallo sign) and also with leg raising, inhalation of amyl nitrate, squatting, or exercise.

The non-specific finding of right atrial enlargement is seen with TS. In patients with concomitant mitral valve disease, additional findings may be seen such as evidence of pulmonary edema (including redistribution of pulmonary blood flow to the upper lobes, and interstitial edema), left atrial enlargement, or a straight left heart border.

Most patients with rheumatic heart disease have concurrent mitral disease, with associated electrocardiographic changes, including signs of left atrial hypertrophy and enlargement and atrial fibrillation.

TS related to pacemaker leads should be suspected in patients with chronic endocardial leads presenting with right heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>TS is generally diagnosed and evaluated by transthoracic echocardiogram. Cardiac catheterization for hemodynamic assessment of the severity of TS is generally not required but is suggested in symptomatic patients when clinical and noninvasive data are discordant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following echocardiographic features are seen with TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid valve leaflets are thickened and distorted with limited leaflet mobility, reduced separation of the leaflet tips, and diastolic doming of the valve. The degree of thickening and calcification with rheumatic TS is generally less pronounced than that seen in rheumatic mitral stenosis.

At a heart rate of 70 bpm, the mean pressure gradient is usually 5 to 10 mmHg, but lower gradients may be seen with lower forward stroke volumes. Higher gradients may occur with combined TS and tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hemodynamic effects of TS cause dilation of the right atrium and inferior vena cava.

In patients with concomitant tricuspid regurgitation, the higher flow through the tricuspid valve further increases the gradient across the valve and the elevation of right atrial pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

After calibration of the two transducers, it is important first to document identical simultaneous recordings of right atrial pressure and then to advance one of the catheters into the right ventricular cavity. Simultaneous recordings of atrial and ventricular pressure are made in at least 8 to 10 cardiac cycles. </p><p>As noted above, at a heart rate of 70 bpm, the mean pressure gradient is usually 5 to 10 mmHg. Diastolic pressure gradients as low as 2 to 4 may indicate severe TS; gradients rarely exceed 10 mmHg. Thus, respiratory variation of a relatively low pressure gradient or non-simultaneous measurements may provide misleading data. A single catheter &quot;pull-back&quot; from the ventricle to the atrium does <strong>NOT</strong> provide a sufficiently accurate measurement of the pressure gradient.

The diastolic murmur of TS may be confused with that of aortic regurgitation if attention is not paid to the response to respiration; the murmur of TS increases with inspiration while the murmur of AR tends to decrease with inspiration.

Since TS is a mechanical disorder, it is most effectively treated by valve intervention, ie, valve surgery (valve repair or replacement) or percutaneous balloon valvotomy. Medical management with diuretic therapy may help reduce symptoms of congestion and thus may be helpful prior to intervention as well as in patients who are not candidates for intervention. </p><p>Thus, treatment of many patients with TS involves a combination of medical therapy and valve intervention. As an example, treatment of symptomatic severe TS related to pacemaker leads generally includes removal of the involved endocardial lead(s) (which may be replaced by an epicardial system for patients who continue to require a pacemaker), tricuspid valve surgery, as well as treatment of any associated infection.

However, diuretic therapy has limited efficacy in patients with TS and use may be limited by worsening low-flow syndrome. </p><p>Medical therapy is also indicated for associated conditions such as atrial fibrillation and plays a limited role in treating concurrent mitral stenosis. In addition, medical therapy is indicated for treatment of some of the causes of TS such as systemic rheumatic diseases and endocarditis.

Few data are available on outcomes in patients with TS with medical management or intervention (tricuspid valve surgery or valvotomy) and controlled data are lacking. Larger studies reporting surgical outcomes for tricuspid valve surgery do not separate cases with predominant TS from those with predominant tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89925583\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of intervention</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113764377\"><span class=\"h4\">Valve surgery versus balloon valvotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients requiring intervention for TS, tricuspid valve surgery (valve repair or replacement) is generally preferred over percutaneous balloon tricuspid valvotomy given greater experience with surgery and since most cases of severe TS are accompanied by tricuspid regurgitation and balloon valvotomy may create or worsen tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Similar considerations apply to patients with bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with isolated symptomatic severe TS with low to moderate surgical risk, we favor tricuspid valve surgery over balloon valvotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with isolated symptomatic severe TS and mild or less tricuspid regurgitation with high surgical risk, we suggest balloon valvotomy.

In a study of 28,726 admissions for tricuspid valve surgery during 1999 to 2008, hospital mortality for tricuspid valve replacement was higher than for tricuspid valve repair (13.6 versus 9.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the difference in mortality between the replacement and repair groups was no longer significant in the subset of patients with liver disease undergoing tricuspid valve surgery. Mortality for replacement remained higher than for repair in the subset of patients without liver disease. Further risk adjustment was not performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term mortality rates may be similar. A report of a series of 530 patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery (for tricuspid regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TS) from 1961 to 1987 found no difference in survival rates or reoperation rates following tricuspid valve repair versus replacement at median four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113764364\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of prosthesis in patients requiring valve replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients requiring tricuspid valve replacement for TS, a bioprosthetic or mechanical valve may be chosen and evidence to guide valve choice is limited. Considerations are similar to those for choice of a prosthetic valve generally (based largely on mitral and aortic data) but data specific to tricuspid valve replacement are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As for prosthetic valves in any position, for patients with limited life expectancy, the increased ongoing risk of anticoagulation to avoid thrombotic complications with a mechanical valve may outweigh the long-term risk of valve failure due to structural valve degeneration with a bioprosthetic valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Available data suggest no survival difference based upon prosthetic type for tricuspid valve replacement (combining TS and tricuspid regurgitation cases). A systematic review reported a pooled survival hazard ratio for mechanical versus bioprosthetic tricuspid valve of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 1.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The pooled freedom from reoperation hazard ratio was 1.24 (95% CI 0.64 to 2.31). </p><p>For valve replacement for TS, the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valve guideline noted only that the choice of prosthesis should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The 2012 ESC valve guidelines indicate that a bioprosthesis is usually preferred over a mechanical prosthesis in this setting due to concern of higher risk of thrombosis with mechanical valves and satisfactory durability of tricuspid bioprosthetic valves, but acknowledge that this is still a matter of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113764457\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes following intervention in patients with severe TS have not been well defined.

The efficacy of valve surgery for TS has not been well described.</p><p>Complications following tricuspid valve surgery are the same as those for other valve surgery, including mortality, prolonged ventilation, renal failure, pneumonia, sepsis, neurologic complications, bleeding, and multiorgan failure. A minority of patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery develop atrioventricular block, requiring permanent pacemaker placement. The rate of pacemaker placement is higher following tricuspid valve replacement than following tricuspid valve repair (eg, 17.2 versus 9.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

A Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database study reported an operative mortality for tricuspid valve surgery (repair or replacement) of 10 percent, which remained similar from 1993 to 1997 and 2003 to 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Similarly, a study of isolated valve surgery outcomes using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 1999 to 2008 reported an overall hospital mortality of 10.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The presence of liver disease was a risk factor for mortality. </p><p>Most tricuspid valve surgery (eg, 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]) is performed as a concomitant procedure with other cardiac surgery and surgery involving more than one valve is generally associated with an increased risk compared to isolated tricuspid valve surgery. In the NIS database study, hospital mortality for tricuspid surgery plus other cardiac surgery was 16.1 percent (significantly higher than for tricuspid surgery alone at 10.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the STS database study, operative mortality for mitral plus tricuspid valve surgery was 8.7 percent during 2003 to 2007, operative mortality for aortic plus tricuspid valve surgery was 11.8 percent during 2003 to 2007, and operative mortality for combined aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve surgery was 13.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Few studies have reported long-term survival after tricuspid valve replacement (for tricuspid regurgitation or TS) and data for controls are generally not available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review reported survival rates for hospital-discharged patients with tricuspid valve prostheses with mean age 49.3 at implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Rheumatic TS almost never occurs as an isolated lesion; it is often accompanied by tricuspid regurgitation and is generally associated with mitral valve disease and, in some cases, the aortic valve. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with TS, obstruction to tricuspid flow limits cardiac output, causes fatigue, and produces symptoms and signs of systemic venous hypertension. Concomitant mitral or aortic disease may cause additional symptoms such as dyspnea. (See <a href=\"#H1759080270\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TS should be suspected in patients with signs and symptoms of systemic venous hypertension, particularly those with conditions associated with TS. TS is generally diagnosed and evaluated by transthoracic echocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H1759080347\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe TS is identified on Doppler echocardiography by a pressure half-time &ge;190 ms and valve area &le;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. Stage C is defined as severe TS without symptoms. Stage D is defined as severe TS with symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1759080570\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since TS is a mechanical disorder, it is most effectively treated by valve intervention, ie, valve surgery (valve repair or replacement) or percutaneous balloon valvotomy. Medical management with diuretic therapy may help reduce symptoms of congestion and thus may be helpful prior to intervention as well as in patients who are not candidates for intervention. (See <a href=\"#H2007699192\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients with severe TS, we suggest tricuspid valve intervention, ie, valve surgery (valve repair or replacement) or percutaneous balloon valvotomy.
