Ninety-five countries and territories have ongoing transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that, &quot;between 2014 and 2016, substantial increases in case incidence occurred in the WHO Region of the Americas and marginally in the South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African regions&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the approximately 3.2 billion people living in malarious countries, 1.2 billion are at high risk; the WHO states that there were 214 million (range 149 to 303 million) cases of symptomatic malaria in 2015 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59290 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Between 2000 and 2015, the incidence of malaria decreased by 32 percent, and the number of annual malaria cases estimated by the WHO decreased by 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The vast majority of these cases and deaths are due to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> and<em> </em>occur in Africa, but <em>Plasmodium vivax </em>and <em>Plasmodium knowlesi </em>can also cause severe disease.</p><p>Important components for reducing the burden of malaria morbidity and mortality early this decade include more sensitive diagnostic tools, effective use of antimalarial drugs, improved personal and community protection, and mosquito control. The approach to elimination or control of malaria includes these basics, along with improvements in tracking of human illness and parasite surveillance, and effective resource delivery.</p><p>Issues related to epidemiology of malaria, including definitions and strategies for control, will be reviewed. Other related topics are discussed in detail separately. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23982573\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria is transmitted via the bite of a female <em>Anopheles</em> spp mosquito, which occurs mainly between dusk and dawn. Other comparatively rare mechanisms for transmission include congenitally acquired disease, blood transfusion, sharing of contaminated needles, organ transplantation, and nosocomial transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The Institute for Health Metrics and Epidemiology (IHME) reported malaria deaths peaked at 1.82 million in 2004 and fell to 1.24 million in 2010 (714,000 children &lt;5 years and 524,000 individuals &ge;5 years); over 85 percent of the deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. In 2017, the WHO recorded 445,000 malaria deaths for 2016 compared with 446,000 in 2015, with downward rates stalling in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ascertainment of cases and deaths is the biggest challenge to understanding program success. Among 55 countries where the burden was estimated, 31 countries have a malaria reporting rate of less than 50 percent. This includes the high-burden countries of India and Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Malaria occurs throughout most of the tropical regions of the world, with <em>P. falciparum</em> causing the largest burden of disease, followed by <em>P. vivax</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72797%7EID%2F103385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72797 graphicRef103385 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>P. falciparum</em> predominates in sub-Saharan Africa, New Guinea, and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); <em>P. vivax</em> is more common in the Americas and the western Pacific. The prevalence of these two species is approximately equal in the Indian subcontinent, eastern Asia, and Oceania (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59290 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. <em>P. malariae</em> is uncommon and is found in most endemic areas, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. <em>Plasmodium ovale</em>, less common, is relatively unusual outside of Africa and comprises &lt;1 percent of isolates. <em>P. knowlesi</em>, similar morphologically to <em>Plasmodium malariae</em>, has been identified by molecular methods in patients in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Myanmar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; this species has not yet been proven to be transmitted from humans to mosquitoes (ie, a monkey reservoir may be required to infect mosquitoes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-falciparum-malaria-plasmodium-vivax-plasmodium-ovale-and-plasmodium-malariae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-falciparum malaria: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology of malaria may vary considerably even within relatively small geographic areas. Endemicity traditionally has been defined in terms of parasitemia rates or palpable spleen rates in children two to nine years of age as hypoendemic (&le;10 percent), mesoendemic (11 to 50 percent), hyperendemic (51 to 74 percent), and holoendemic (&ge;75 percent). In holo- and hyperendemic areas (eg, certain regions of tropical Africa or coastal New Guinea where there is intense <em>P. falciparum</em> transmission), people may receive more than one infectious mosquito bite per day and are infected repeatedly throughout their lives. In such settings with intense perennial transmission, morbidity and mortality due to malaria during childhood are considerable. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of parasitemia shows a higher prevalence of malaria than microscopy or rapid diagnosing testing; hence, some areas undoubtedly have a higher endemic status than previously thought or recorded.</p><p>The entomologic inoculation rate (EIR; the number of infectious female anopheline bites per person per year) is a term used to indicate transmission intensity. While there are seasonal and geographic differences, an EIR of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10/year</span> is low transmission, 10 to <span class=\"nowrap\">49/year</span> is intermediate, and <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50/year</span> is a high transmission area. In general, the higher the EIR, the greater the burden of malaria, particularly on young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Constant, year-round infection is termed stable transmission, generally occurring in areas with EIRs of <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50/year;</span> in such areas, most malaria infections in long-term resident adults are asymptomatic. In areas where transmission is low, highly seasonal, or focal, full protective immunity is not acquired, and symptomatic disease occurs at all ages. Malaria behaves like an epidemic disease in some areas, particularly those with seasonal unstable malaria such as northern India (Rajasthan), Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Burundi, southern Africa (Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe), and Madagascar. An epidemic can develop when there are changes in environmental, economic, or social conditions, such as heavy rains following drought or migrations (usually of refugees or workers) from a non-malarious region to an area of high transmission; a breakdown in malaria control and prevention services can intensify epidemic conditions. This situation usually results in considerable morbidity and mortality among all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The principal determinants of the epidemiology of malaria are the number (density), the human-biting habits (indoors or outdoors), and the longevity of the female anopheline vectors. More specifically, the transmission of malaria is directly proportional to the density of the vector, the square of the number of human bites per day per mosquito, and the 10<sup>th</sup> power of the probability of the mosquito's survival for one day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Mosquito longevity is particularly important, because the portion of the parasite's life cycle that takes place within the mosquito (sporogony; from gametocyte ingestion to subsequent inoculation) lasts for 8 to 30 days, depending on the species of <em>Plasmodium</em> and ambient temperature; thus, to transmit malaria, the mosquito must survive for &gt;10 days. The most effective mosquito vectors of malaria are those such as <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> in Africa, which are long lived, occur in high densities in tropical climates, breed readily, rest and bite within dwellings, and bite humans in preference to other animals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23968136\"><span class=\"h3\">Chloroquine susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spread of drug-resistant <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria has been a major impediment to malaria control and elimination. The distribution and approach to therapy for chloroquine-resistant malaria are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-falciparum-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;, section on 'Chloroquine-resistant malaria'</a>.)</p><p>In a region of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> resistance in Malawi, return of chloroquine-susceptible <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria was demonstrated following abandonment of chloroquine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These chloroquine-susceptible parasites likely represent a re-expansion of the susceptible parasites that survived in the population despite widespread drug pressure in the region. Despite this finding, it is not advised to use chloroquine for treatment in Malawi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23982632\"><span class=\"h2\">Malaria surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical, epidemiologic, entomologic, and parasitologic surveillance of malaria is required to follow the progress of malaria control, elimination, and eradication programs. Depending on resources and control program progress, emphasis should be on clinical manifestations of illness in hospitals and health units initially (passive surveillance) and then on rural communities. As elimination is undertaken, active detection of malaria infections house by house (active surveillance) will become essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Modern information technologies (eg, cell phones, hand-held data entry devices, computerized reporting, feedback bulletins) will be necessary to assure prompt and accurate sharing of information. Surveillance of morbidity, mortality, disability, drug, and insecticide resistance and of commodities will be the key to malaria elimination and ultimately eradication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; additionally, provider practices and patient compliance require monitoring and evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>An article summarizing nearly 27,000 malaria parasite prevalence surveys in Africa indicated that there has been a 40 percent reduction in the prevalence of malaria infection across most of sub-Saharan Africa in the decade 2000 to 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Interventions have averted 663 million clinical cases (542 to 753 million credible interval) since 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Reductions in transmissions, while encouraging, are modest; more sensitive detection methods are needed, particularly of asymptomatic infections in areas targeted for elimination.</p><p>An analysis of deaths due to malaria in Africa noted highest mortality rates and lowest coverage of bed nets and antimalarial drug use in Nigeria, Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, and Equatorial Guinea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A review of antimalarial drug quality in Asia and Africa showed an alarming prevalence of counterfeit drugs on the shelves of pharmacies in multiple countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; up to 36 percent of antimalarial drugs and 43 percent of the artemisinin combination drugs were falsified. This criminal behavior requires more attention, including definition of the problem locally, scientific and technological means to identify rapidly poor quality drugs and other commodities (eg, diagnostic tests), regulatory action, and national and international laws.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3302401482\"><span class=\"h2\">Progress to elimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increasing number of countries are moving toward elimination of malaria. Whereas 13 countries were estimated to have fewer than 1000 malaria cases in 2000, 33 countries are estimated to have achieved this milestone in 2015. In 2014, 16 countries reported zero indigenous cases (Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Iraq, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan). Another three countries and territories reported fewer than 10 indigenous cases (Algeria, El Salvador, and Mayotte [France]). The WHO European Region reported zero indigenous cases for the first time in 2015, and Sri Lanka was declared free of malaria in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].</p><p>Stringent environmental management and &quot;integrated vector control&quot; (concurrent use of multiple approaches) will be required for eradication. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and IRS are strategic components for all three groups; these and other strategies are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To consider interventions for malaria control, it is important to define the goals of control, elimination, and eradication. Control is reduction of disease incidence and prevalence to levels that do not pose a threat to public health or that are acceptable to a community. Elimination is reduction of incidence and transmission to zero in humans in a defined geographic area. Eradication is global elimination of human disease. In all instances, a surveillance system that could detect, respond to, and report malaria cases and infections promptly is essential.</p><p>Despite progress, one problem with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs; now Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs], which aimed to reduce malaria incidence and prevalence by 75 percent by 2015 compared to 2000) is that baseline epidemiologic information for malaria is incomplete in most endemic countries. Following successful elimination and eradication, ongoing rigorous surveillance is needed to identify imported cases, which must be detected, treated, and contained promptly to prevent reestablishment of endemic infection. Because there are no nonhuman reservoirs for the human plasmodia, malaria is considered by many to be a candidate for eradication.</p><p>In the past, clinical diagnosis alone has been used in most endemic African areas for recording malaria cases, contributing to imprecisions. Training and supervision of clinicians in proper diagnosis of presumed malaria remain the most important keys to effective management and surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Microscopic confirmation of malaria, the historic &quot;gold standard,&quot; is frequently delayed and inaccurate; hence, the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is being used with increasing frequency. Advantages of RDTs include improved diagnosis, rapidity, and more rational use of antimalarial drugs. Diagnosis of malaria is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the Bill and Melinda Gates challenge to the world community to eradicate malaria, there is increasing enthusiasm to reassess older control methods and develop and evaluate new ones through research. The approach to malaria eradication proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) includes the preparatory, attack, consolidation, and maintenance phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79347\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79347 \">figure 2</a>). Progression between these phases depends on reducing the incidence of parasitemia in the population, which requires an understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of malaria transmission. Intrinsic factors include the relationships between human, parasite, and mosquito; extrinsic factors include the environment, socioeconomic milieu, and control initiatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The most important epidemiological criterion for moving from the attack to the consolidation phase of malaria eradication (in which surveillance is the key) is annual incidence of &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">infections/1000</span> persons (1 case per 10,000 population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Research in support of malaria eradication is a major component of the current global effort. The malaria eradication research agenda (malERA) has been defined by task forces addressing specific themes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACHES TO CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strategies to disrupt malaria transmission include effective deployment of antimalarial drugs, personal mosquito protection, mosquito vector control, and research (including vaccine development) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Optimal malaria control (eg, leading to elimination) using these tools requires the following elements of the new World Health Organization (WHO) Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016 to 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition to acceleration of elimination, country and community ownership, improved surveillance, equity in health services, and innovation in tools and implementation, the technical foci are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective human, parasitologic, and entomologic surveillance at health facilities and in communities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An understanding of local <em>Anopheline</em> ecology (including breeding, biting, and resting habits)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administrative, managerial, supervisory, and operational capacity (including trained leaders and staff)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ongoing monitoring and evaluation system for deployment and use of drugs, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and environmental modifications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained high-level, long-term national and international commitment</p><p/><p>In 2008, the WHO divided 104 malarious countries into three groups: 25 countries that have recently eliminated malaria or with conditions amenable to elimination, 32 countries with unstable malaria amenable to control and elimination with current tools, and 47 countries with stable transmission and poor infrastructure (eg, requiring further infrastructure development before additional measures can be implemented) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/10,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30</a>]. This baseline scheme, while evolving, remains in use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659808458\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal protection from infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential tools for personal protection from infection include use of mosquito repellants and insecticide treated nets, intermittent preventive treatment for selected patient groups, and vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2709824157\"><span class=\"h3\">Mosquito repellents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repellents applied to exposed skin may be used to protect against mosquito bites. Effective repellents include synthetic preparations such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), Picardin (KBR3023) and IR 3535, as well as PMD (P-MENTHANE-3,8-DIOL), which is derived from lemon eucalyptus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For maximal protection against mosquitoes, DEET is preferable over other agents. Selection and use of mosquito repellents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of mosquito repellents for protection against malaria is variable depending on the transmitting mosquito vector. Repellents are most effective in areas where vectors feed in the early evening (as with many South American and Asian vectors) rather than later in the night (as with African vectors such as <em>An. gambiae</em>). Repellents may also be more effective in regions with zoophilic vectors as in the Americas and south Asia (where mosquitoes may be diverted from a repellent-treated person to an animal) than in regions with anthropophilic vectors (Africa). This was illustrated in a cluster-randomized study of 4008 participants in rural Bolivia, where the principal vector is <em>Anopheles darlingi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. All participants slept under treated nets; one group also used a plant-based insect repellent each evening, while a second group used placebo. Rates of <em>P. vivax</em> malaria episodes were reduced by 80 percent. A protective but not significant effect was observed for <em>P. falciparum</em> as the number of cases was small.</p><p>Repellents have also been protective against malaria in refugee camps on the Pakistan-Afghan border; in this region, the main vectors of malaria are <em>Anopheles stephensi</em>, <em>An. culicifacies</em>, <em>An. pulcherrimus,</em> and <em>An. nigerrimus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Among 127 families randomized to receive repellent soap (20% <span class=\"nowrap\">DEET/0</span>.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a>) or placebo, fewer cases of <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria were observed among those using repellent soap (3.7 versus 8.9 percent). There was no effect against <em>P. vivax</em> malaria.</p><p>In regions where vectors feed in the middle of the night, repellents might not increase the degree of protection afforded by use of insecticide-treated nets alone; this requires further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2959125221\"><span class=\"h3\">Insecticide-treated nets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyrethroids are the major insecticides used routinely for bed net treatment. Newer long-lasting insecticidal nets are washproof pyrethroid-impregnated nets; they may be used for about five years, after which they must be replaced because of wear (with holes) and a decreased pyrethroid content. Only LLINs should be deployed in control and elimination programs.</p><p>Widespread community use of ITNs reduces the proportion of mosquitoes surviving long enough to transmit malaria; each attempt at a blood meal from an ITN-protected human results in a potentially lethal insecticide exposure for the mosquito [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A study in the Gambia showed that community-wide ITN coverage can reduce malaria-attributable mortality by 30 percent and overall mortality in children by 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Use of pyrethroid-impregnated nets thus far does not appear to have toxicity for humans, but further evaluation is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>For high frequency of adherence to ITN use, health education in communities is essential for assuring correct installation, hours of use, and maintenance of the ITNs. Follow-up of ITNs provided to a community in Tanzania several years earlier confirmed that individuals continued to use the nets, in part because of their additional impact on other nuisance insects such as bedbugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some have postulated that use of ITNs for reducing the burden of malaria may slow development of immunity to infection among children; this does not appear to be the case. After nearly four years of community ITN use in Tanzania, morbidity among very young children diminished, and morbidity among older children was comparable to aged-matched controls in villages without nets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 130,000 persons in western Kenya, the mortality rate for children &lt;1 year was significantly decreased after four years of ITN use with no increase in mortality among older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Serological studies have shown diminished levels of antimalarial antibodies after prolonged ITN use in a community, but the clinical significance of this observation is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There has been concern about the emergence of pyrethroid resistance among major mosquito vectors; laboratory detection of resistance genes may or may not correlate with epidemiologic observations. While genes for pyrethroid resistance have been demonstrated first among mosquito vectors in the Ivory Coast, ITNs remain effective for killing mosquitoes and preventing malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, failure of pyrethroid-based ITNs to kill mosquitoes has been reported in West Africa and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p>Use of pyrethroids for ITNs is more economical than IRS.

Frequency of IRS application varies from once or twice yearly for organochlorine compounds (eg, DDT) to three or more times for organophosphates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malathion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">malathion</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Mosquito contact with insecticide-treated surfaces is generally lethal; sublethal exposure drives mosquitoes outside the house.

Widespread community IRS reduces the proportion of mosquitoes surviving long enough to transmit malaria since each mosquito attempt at a blood meal results in a potentially lethal insecticide exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/78,85,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,85,87</a>]. Community health education about IRS is essential; spraying may require furniture rearrangements, the walls may become streaked with chemical treatments, and there may be a residual odor from the IRS.</p><p>DDT is a widely used IRS insecticide based on its efficacy, low cost, low toxicity, and length of effect. Use of DDT is approved for indoor vector control by a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from chemicals (persistent organic pollutants [POPS]) that remain in the environment for long periods. The exemption for human health purposes requires that rigorous measures are taken to avoid outdoor agricultural use where DDT may cause harm to wildlife [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. DDT was used for IRS programs that achieved malaria elimination in many areas in the 1940s and 1950s (including the southern United States, most Caribbean islands, southern Europe, most of the former USSR, and Taiwan).

This resulted from environmental concerns about toxicity and pressure against DDT use, and there has been a reduction in production of the compound. Subsequently, resistance to pyrethroids emerged rapidly among <em>An. funestus</em> mosquitoes; in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, the incidence of malaria increased greatly. A return to DDT (together with a switch in the first-line antimalarial drug to artemisinin-based compounds) reduced the malaria incidence rate by 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>In regions where <em>Anopheles</em> populations have developed resistance to DDT, organophosphates, carbamates, or pyrethroids have been used.

In mid-2009, the WHO modified their position again stating that DDT should be phased out over time to be replaced with other insecticides.</p><p>One study performed in Uganda noted that the combination of IRS and LLINs was associated with a marked decline in the burden of malaria; use of LLINs alone had a modest impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>However, a study in Uganda (where high-level coverage of LLINs was achieved) showed that stopping IRS after four years of twice-yearly household spraying was associated with a rapid increase in malaria morbidity to pre-IRS levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

However, a major reduction in the density of adult <em>An. gambiae</em> was achieved in a Kenyan village by use of the bacterial toxin <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> israelensis (Bti). This toxin is highly specific for mosquito larvae and targets very few other species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Bti has a short half-life, and over 400 potential breeding sites were checked weekly and retreated, if necessary. <em>An. funestus</em> may be a more feasible target for antilarval control measures in Africa given that its breeding sites are larger and more permanent.</p><p>A problem with many of the biological control approaches to larval control has been that they are difficult to expand to large scale or national public usefulness. This is because of the site-specific nature of the research and other constraints. In some projects, the imported fish species did not adapt to local conditions and they were avidly consumed by the human populations they were to protect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Genetic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic strategies for malaria control entail using male mosquitoes to introduce genetic factors that prevent the eggs from hatching, prevent the larvae from surviving, or produce adult insects incapable of transmitting human disease. Despite years of investigation, genetic control remains a promising research theme.</p><p>To prevent eggs from hatching or larvae from surviving, males carrying sterilizing factors (dominant lethal mutations introduced by irradiation of the adult male) compete for mates in a target population of females who have not already mated with fertile males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This is known as the sterile insect technique (SIT). Experience with SIT for <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes is limited, although the technique has been successful for eradication of other pests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>To produce adult insects incapable of transmitting disease, a transgenic system has been developed that greatly reduces susceptibility of <em>An. stephensi</em> to infection with rodent malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. It is hoped that similar approaches will soon produce strains completely non-susceptible to <em>P. falciparum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. However, the optimal approach for creating genetic factors that selectively incorporate themselves into later generations in a wild population is under intense study but remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213458126\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of acute infection to reduce transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of antimalarial drugs for treatment of acute illness is essential, although their effect on transmission and control of malaria in endemic areas is limited since most antimalarial drugs do not eliminate gametocytes. Issues related to the use of gametocidal drugs for reduction of malaria transmission are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-falciparum-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> may be an effective form of mosquito control; further study is needed. One study including 120 patients noted that blood from those treated with both ivermectin and artemeter-lumefantrine was associated with greater mortality among membrane-fed <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes compared with blood from patients treated with artemeter-lumefantrine only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Nutritional iron supplementation is appropriate for anemic children at risk of iron deficiency in areas where malaria is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Iron-deficiency anemia is common in endemic regions; nutritional iron administered to children has not been associated with frequent episodes malaria or malaria infection of greater severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malaria-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2781288902\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To consider interventions for malaria control, it is important to define goals of control, elimination, and eradication. Control is reduction of disease incidence and prevalence to levels that do not pose a threat to public health or that are acceptable to a community. Elimination is reduction to zero transmission in humans in a defined geographic area. Eradication is global elimination of human disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) appears to be useful for reducing the risk of malaria infection among individuals at high risk, particularly pregnant women. IPT and seasonal chemoprophylaxis of target groups are important policies in the new World Health Organization Strategic Plan. (See <a href=\"#H29018577\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent preventive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mosquito vector control methods include use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), household insecticide residual spraying (IRS), larval control, and genetic control methods. Since effective insecticides for use against adult <em>Anopheles</em> have become available, ITNs and IRS have become the most important measures for mosquito vector control. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mosquito control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of mosquito repellents for protection against malaria is variable depending on the transmitting mosquito vector. (See <a href=\"#H2709824157\" class=\"local\">'Mosquito repellents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A successful malaria vaccine used in conjunction with other control interventions could reduce the global disease burden of malaria. (See <a href=\"#H1024292930\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine development'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring progress by continuous, timely, widely shared surveillance information is the key to control and eradication. Surveillance of the quality of antimalarial drugs (and other commodities) is essential to assure effective treatment and prevention. (See <a href=\"#H23982632\" class=\"local\">'Malaria surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuing research on the issues noted above is required to achieve control, elimination, and eradication of malaria in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
