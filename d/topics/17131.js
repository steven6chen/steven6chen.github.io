However, the utility of measuring total serum IgE or allergen-specific IgE for purposes of diagnosis and management is variable. It is important to recognize that levels of total IgE rarely provide information about IgE to specific allergens, and the presence of IgE to a specific allergen does not necessarily equate to a clinically meaningful allergic response to that substance. It is also necessary to demonstrate that the individual develops appropriate signs and symptoms upon exposure to the allergen in question.</p><p>This topic will review basic concepts concerning the generation of the allergic response and provide an overview of the roles of total and allergen-specific IgE in various allergic diseases. The biology of IgE and the diagnosis of specific allergic diseases are discussed separately.

At a cellular level, atopy appears to result, in part, from a predisposition toward a certain response on the part of CD4+ T helper cells called a T helper type 2 (Th2) response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The CD4 molecule is a coreceptor in the T cell receptor complex and also binds proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Th2 cells secrete large quantities of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which promote the production of allergen-specific IgE by plasma cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige#H264545938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;, section on 'Regulation of synthesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366655\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensitization refers to the production of allergen-specific IgE. Sensitization to an allergen is <strong>not</strong> synonymous with being allergic to that allergen, because individuals may produce IgE to allergens in a given substance, but not develop symptoms upon exposure to that substance. It is unclear why some individuals demonstrate only sensitization while others have active allergic disease.</p><p>Sensitization is usually demonstrated by skin testing or in vitro immunoassays for IgE to specific allergens (sometimes referred to as radioallergosorbent or RAST testing, although this term describes an antiquated form of the test). Thus, sensitization is necessary but not sufficient for the development of allergic disease. Because a person can be sensitized to an allergen but not react to it upon exposure, it is prudent to limit allergy testing to those allergens which are implicated by the clinical history.</p><p>The production of allergen-specific IgE is summarized briefly here in simplified form and reviewed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige#H13745053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;, section on 'Synthesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once a substance enters the body (through ingestion, inhalation, or injection), it is degraded, and allergens (usually proteins but occasionally carbohydrates) are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages, CD1+ dendritic cells, B cells, and possibly, epithelial cells. APCs further degrade the allergen and present peptide fragments of it on the cell surface in the setting of class II MHC molecules. The <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/MHC</span> II complexes are recognized by Th2 cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Th2 cells then interact with B cells and in the presence of various costimulatory signals, stimulate the B cell to mature into a plasma cell that produces IgE specific to the component of the allergen in question. B cell maturation primarily occurs within mucosal lymphoid tissue.</p><p>After IgE antibodies specific for a certain allergen are synthesized and secreted, they diffuse throughout the body, binding to high-affinity receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the circulating blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55328\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55328 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366662\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals are considered to have clinically significant allergy or allergic disease when they have both allergen-specific IgE <strong>and</strong> develop symptoms upon exposure to substances containing that allergen. Therefore, greater numbers of people are sensitized to an allergen than are clinically allergic to it. This was illustrated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006, in which over 8000 people from the general population of the United States were interviewed and tested (using in vitro blood tests) for sensitization to 19 common inhalant allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Specific IgE antibodies to at least one allergen were present in 44 percent, whereas only 34 percent had symptoms suggestive of allergic disease. Similar findings have been documented for food allergy. In a population-based birth cohort study in the United Kingdom, 12 percent of children were sensitized to peanut at eight years of age, but only 2 percent were allergic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A sensitized person may develop symptoms when re-exposed to the relevant allergen if the allergen is able to bind to IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and basophils in sufficient numbers to cause clustering (called cross-linking) of the IgE molecules. Cross-linking of enough IgE receptors results in the generation of activating signals. Upon activation, mast cells and basophils release preformed and newly-formed chemical and protein mediators, which directly and indirectly lead to the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions. These mediators include histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, cytokines, and others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common allergic diseases include allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, stinging insect venom allergy, and drug allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4432104\"><span class=\"h2\">The atopic march</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma often affect the same patients and develop in temporal succession. This progression from atopic dermatitis in infancy to allergic rhinitis and asthma in childhood and young adulthood is referred to as the &quot;allergic march&quot; or &quot;atopic march&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Nearly 80 percent of children with atopic dermatitis will subsequently develop allergic rhinitis or asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25256003\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TOTAL IgE LEVELS AND ALLERGIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A total serum IgE level of 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> is typically cited as the upper limit of normal in older adolescents and adults. Elevations in total serum IgE are seen in several types of disorders, including allergic diseases, some primary immunodeficiencies, parasitic and viral infections, certain inflammatory diseases, some malignancies, and several other diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83457 \">table 1</a>). Thus, elevated total serum IgE is not specific to allergic disease. Studies concerning allergic diseases are reviewed here, while studies of IgE in other diseases are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige#H13745149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;, section on 'Increased total IgE'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127469\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated total serum IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with allergic disorders have elevated levels of total IgE; however, there is no specific cutoff value that discriminates patients with allergic disease from those without, and there is considerable overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Thus, total IgE by itself is rarely adequate to diagnose allergic disease. The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with IgE &gt;66 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> have a 37-fold greater risk of having allergen-specific IgE antibodies to aeroallergens compared with those patients with the lowest levels of total IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, school-aged children had a mean IgE level of 51 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>.

Patients with low or normal serum IgE levels could still have local production of allergen-specific IgE in the tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige#H1397010\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;, section on 'Localized IgE production'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128141\"><span class=\"h2\">Utility in predicting the development of allergic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because elevations in total serum IgE are associated with established allergic disease, researchers have questioned whether IgE levels predict its development. Studies suggest that elevated total IgE is associated with an increased risk of allergic disease, although there is significant overlap between affected and unaffected individuals, such that the measurement is most useful in the context of population studies rather than in the diagnosis or management of an individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128173\"><span class=\"h3\">Cord blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cord blood IgE levels have been studied in an attempt to identify newborns who are at increased risk for the development of allergic disease. Maternal IgE does not normally cross the placenta, although fetal cord blood can be contaminated by maternal blood during late pregnancy and delivery and must be carefully collected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The majority of studies suggest that elevated total IgE in cord blood is an indicator of higher risk. As examples, studies have shown that newborns with elevated cord IgE levels had an increased risk of developing urticarial food reactions at 1 year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], atopic dermatitis by 2 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], allergen sensitization and wheezing at 7 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], or allergic rhinitis by 11 and 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, no relationship was found between cord blood IgE levels and the development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis by the time the child was 18 to 21 years of age despite a modest association with total IgE levels at those ages in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige#H13745125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;, section on 'Childhood levels'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1126963\"><span class=\"h3\">Childhood IgE levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated IgE in young children appears to be an early predictor of the subsequent development of allergen-specific IgE and allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the clinical utility of this is limited by the extensive overlap between atopic and nonatopic individuals and the fact that patients with asthma have higher total IgE compared with nonasthmatics, regardless of atopic status. (See <a href=\"#H25256003\" class=\"local\">'Relationships between total IgE levels and allergic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5310840\" class=\"local\">'Asthma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127398\"><span class=\"h3\">Timeline of sensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the presence of allergen-specific IgE precedes the onset of symptoms by several years. In a study of nearly 1000 college students, subjects were evaluated initially and again 7 and 16 years later using questionnaires and skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At the seven-year follow-up, subjects with prior positive skin tests demonstrated an increased risk of developing allergic rhinitis and asthma. When these same patients were reassessed 16 years later, a 2.3-fold greater risk of developing allergic rhinitis was found in those subjects with positive allergen skin tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Positive allergy skin tests and allergic rhinitis increased the likelihood of developing asthma by threefold.</p><p>In a small minority of patients, sensitization occurs only in the affected tissues, presumably due to low levels of allergen-specific IgE being produced by local mucosal plasma cells. This phenomenon of local IgE production is termed &quot;entopy.&quot; In such patients, allergen-specific IgE is not demonstrable by either allergy skin testing or blood work, which presents diagnostic challenges. This is best described for some patients with rhinitis who have negative skin tests and in vitro tests for allergen-specific IgE, yet react to challenge with inhaled allergen.

Conversely, nonatopic patients with high levels of IgE are more likely to have asthma than those with normal IgE levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one study, nonallergic patients with a total serum IgE level greater than 150 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> were at a fivefold higher risk of having asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Still, the increase in elevated total IgE in asthmatics compared with nonasthmatics is generally driven by atopic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Increased expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc-epsilon-RI) has been demonstrated on cells in the airways of both atopic and nonatopic asthma patients compared with nonatopic control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. IgE positively regulates Fc-epsilon-RI levels, so both IgE and Fc-epsilon-RI tend to increase or decrease in parallel. Patients with atopic dermatitis and asthma are more likely than controls to have mutations in the alpha subunit of Fc-epsilon-R1 (the subunit that directly binds to IgE) associated with increased serum IgE levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In allergic patients with asthma, anti-IgE therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) improves symptoms, reduces exacerbations and medication requirements, and decreases multiple inflammatory markers, demonstrating the role of IgE in allergic asthma. Total IgE levels are required for appropriate dosing of omalizumab in persistent asthma patients.

The gold standard testing for food allergy is the double-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge to the food in question. However, because this can be a labor intensive procedure and can potentially induce severe allergic reactions, alternatives such as skin prick testing and in vitro food-specific IgE testing are often performed instead. The information from these tests must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history, because patients can have food-specific IgE and not react to ingestion of that food. Interpretation of test results in the context of the patient's pretest probability often requires expertise.

However, the measurement of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE has variable utility in the diagnosis and management of allergic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H5310808\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atopy refers to the genetic predilection to produce allergen-specific IgE. Sensitization refers to the presence of allergen-specific IgE in the absence of clinical disease. Individuals are considered to have clinically significant allergy or allergic disease when they have both allergen-specific IgE <strong>and</strong> develop symptoms upon exposure to that allergen. (See <a href=\"#H1366636\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated total IgE is seen with some allergic disorders, as well as several nonallergic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83457 \">table 1</a>). Many patients (although not all) with allergic disorders have elevated levels of total IgE. However, there is no specific cutoff value that discriminates patients with allergic disease from those without, and there is considerable overlap. (See <a href=\"#H25256003\" class=\"local\">'Relationships between total IgE levels and allergic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated total IgE is associated with an increased risk of allergic disease, although there is significant overlap between affected and unaffected individuals, such that the measurement is most useful in the context of population studies, rather than in the diagnosis or management of an individual. Allergen-specific IgE is usually detectable several years before a person becomes reactive to that allergen, although only a subset of sensitized people will ever develop symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1128141\" class=\"local\">'Utility in predicting the development of allergic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of total and allergen-specific IgE levels in pathogenesis and diagnosis differs among the leading allergic disorders. Asthma correlates with increased total IgE levels, regardless of atopic status. Allergic rhinitis is associated with allergen-specific IgE antibodies, although not with total IgE levels. Patients with atopic dermatitis may have very elevated levels of total IgE, although only a minority of patients (mostly children with severe atopic dermatitis) has clinically apparent allergic reactions to food. Thus the usefulness of measuring total IgE in allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis is very limited.
