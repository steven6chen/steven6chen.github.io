These changes alter normal hematopoietic growth and differentiation, resulting in an accumulation of large numbers of abnormal, immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. These cells are capable of dividing and proliferating, but cannot differentiate into mature hematopoietic cells (ie, neutrophils).</p><p>This topic will review the cell of origin and the multistep and multicausal pathogenesis of AML.

Hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent and have the capacity to differentiate into the cells of all 10 blood lineages &mdash; erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. In order to sustain hematopoiesis, stem cells are part of a developmental hierarchy capable of three basic functions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance in a non-cycling state (ie, not actively progressing through the cell cycle)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-renewal, allowing production of additional stem cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Production of committed progenitor cells</p><p/><p>These progenitor cells commit to subsets of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and ultimately to single developmental pathways, resulting in the expression of the terminally differentiated stage of each cell type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal hematopoiesis is a dynamic, highly regulated process controlled by the combined effects of growth factors that permit cellular proliferation, and nuclear transcription factors that activate specific genetic programs, resulting in commitment to a specific lineage and in terminal differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76779 \">figure 2</a>). Many of the regulatory growth factors and a number of specific transcription factors have been identified that play critical roles in lineage commitment, and in the subsequent development of the mature lymphoid and myeloid (erythroid, <span class=\"nowrap\">granulocytic/monocytic,</span> and megakaryocytic) lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>A number of genes encoding these transcription factors are involved in recurring chromosomal translocations seen in AML, suggesting that the AML variants arise because the translocations result in significant alterations in regulatory processes controlling growth and differentiation programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The novel fusion genes created by these translocations will be reviewed separately.

It is believed that virtually all cases of AML are preceded by a premalignant proliferative disorder characterized by clonal hematopoiesis. Three large sequencing studies identified clonal hematopoiesis in approximately 4 percent of the general population and the incidence increased with age: 6 percent of persons 60 to 69 years; 10 percent of persons 70 to 79 years; 12 percent of persons 80 to 89 years; and 18 percent of persons 90 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Clonal hematopoiesis most commonly involved a mutation in DNMT3A, TET2, or ASXL1, mutations that are associated with myeloid malignancies. While clonal hematopoiesis was associated with an increased risk of hematologic cancer, the absolute risk of progression was very small.</p><p>Studies of isoenzyme restriction in leukemic myeloblasts of females heterozygous for the A and B isoforms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) have demonstrated the clonal origin of AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The G6PD locus is on a portion of the X chromosome that undergoes inactivation in XX somatic cells (Lyonization). Approximately one-half of the cells in normal somatic tissue will have randomly inactivated one or the other of the X chromosomes, allowing expression of the A and B isoforms in approximately equal amounts. Cells of clonal origin, however, express only one type of G6PD. In each of the G6PD heterozygous females with AML, both types of enzyme were found in normal tissues, but only a single type was observed in the leukemic myeloblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached using X-linked recombinant DNA probes, standard cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

However, there is growing information to support that all leukemias, including AML, appear to be maintained by a pool of self-renewing malignant cells. Based on their ability to serially transfer the disease upon xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, it has been hypothesized that limited numbers of cells within the bulk population of leukemic cells have the capacity to function as stem cells that maintain the potential for unlimited self-renewal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These leukemic stem cells (LSC, also leukemia-initiating cells) may be more immature than the majority of circulating leukemic cells, and are thought to have originated from cells with existing self-renewal capacity or from progenitors that have re-acquired this stem cell-like property.</p><p>According to this hypothesis, the majority of leukemia cells do not have unlimited self-renewal and exhibit some features of partial differentiation depending on the genetic aberration present. However, xenotransplantation of human leukemia cells might not be the best experimental system to examine leukemia stem cell capacity. When lymphomas and leukemias of mouse origin are transplanted into histocompatible mice, a very high frequency (at least 1 in 10) of these cells can transfer the disease to recipient mice suggesting that the low frequency of leukemia-initiating cells observed in xenotransplantation studies may reflect the limited ability of human tumor cells to adapt to growth in a foreign (mouse) milieu [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2186046\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage of leukemic transformation</span></p><p>Two models have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of AML observed at the molecular, cytogenetic, phenotypic, and clinical level.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transformation to leukemia occurring at one of several developmental stages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transformation to leukemia occurring within primitive multipotent cells </p><p/><p>There is no universal agreement as to which of these two models best reflects the truth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Transformation at one of several developmental stages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This model proposes that any cell type within the stem <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/progenitor</span> cell hierarchy, from primitive multipotent stem cell to lineage-committed progenitor cell, is susceptible to leukemic transformation, resulting in the expansion of abnormal cells that exhibit different stages of differentiation. For AML, this model predicts that the phenotype of the leukemic stem cells restricted to the granulocytic-monocytic series differs from that of cells with involvement of erythroid, megakaryocytic, and granulocytic-monocytic lineages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The correlation between specific cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations and the morphologic appearance of leukemic cells might suggest that the transforming event occurs at different stages of myeloid differentiation. This hypothesis is underscored by the classification for AML, which distinguishes some subtypes of AML based upon the stage of apparent differentiation (eg, AML with minimal differentiation). Support for this model includes flow <span class=\"nowrap\">cytometric/molecular</span> analyses of the leukemic cell in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that suggest that the leukemic cell arises in a committed lineage-restricted, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38+</span> progenitor cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Transformation within primitive multipotent cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second model proposes that mutations responsible for leukemic transformation and progression occur only in primitive multipotent stem cells, with disease heterogeneity resulting from a variable ability of these primitive stem cells to differentiate and acquire specific phenotypic lineage markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Hematopoietic stem cells express a characteristic cell surface antigen (CD34), and can be further subdivided by the expression of additional cell surface antigens, including CD38 and HLA-DR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77910 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38-/HLA-DR-</span> cells are multipotential hematopoietic stem cells, give rise to mixed-lineage granulocytic-erythroid-megakaryocytic colonies in culture, can repopulate immune deficient mice with normal hematopoietic cells in vivo, and demonstrate self-renewal capacity, as assessed by their ability to be serially transplanted into recipient mice. There are data to suggest that, in some cases of AML, the leukemic stem cell may be quite similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38+/HLA-DR+</span> cells define a committed population of myeloid progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Similar findings were noted in patients with the 5q- syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and monosomy 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], myelodysplastic disorders with differing risks of leukemic transformation.

These experiments have detected approximately one SCID mouse leukemia-initiating cell (SL-IC) in 10<sup>5</sup> AML cells, which can repopulate immune deficient mice with leukemic cells phenotypically identical to those of the AML patient from which they were derived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>].</p><p>Using a non-obese diabetic <span class=\"nowrap\">(NOD)/SCID</span> mouse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], SL-ICs were found to reside only in the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38-</span> fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This was consistent regardless of the AML subtype, lineage markers, or percentage of leukemic blast cells expressing the CD34 antigen. The SL-ICs also demonstrated self-renewal capacity, a requirement for maintenance of the leukemic clone. The uniformity of the leukemic stem cell phenotype strongly suggests that the leukemia initiating transformation and progression-associated genetic events occur in primitive cells and not in committed progenitors. Similar conclusions about the site of the leukemia initiating transformation have been made in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence for the second model derives from the use of a retroviral gene transfer system to express <span class=\"nowrap\">AML1/ETO,</span> a fusion gene linked to the pathogenesis of AML, in normal human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. When this fusion gene was expressed in more mature progenitor cells, the result was growth arrest and abrogated colony formation in primary clonogenic assays. On the other hand, <span class=\"nowrap\">AML1/ETO</span> expression in stem cells resulted in their preferential expansion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-renewal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Such multi-lineage involvement has been noted more frequently in elderly patients, in those whose AML arose following a documented prior myelodysplastic disorder, or following treatment for another malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection by stromal cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AML cells develop in the bone marrow where interaction with the microenvironment may foster chemoresistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].

Historically, pancytopenia in AML has been attributed to the leukemic cells either displacing or killing normal hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. However, subsequent studies suggest that, in patients with AML, the number of normal hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow is normal or increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Instead, the leukemic cells appear to inhibit the ability of the hematopoietic stem cells to produce more mature hematopoietic cells.

Such clonal remission may represent the presence of a &quot;preleukemic stem cell&quot; that has undergone an initial transforming event but has not acquired the additional mutation(s) essential to progression to overt leukemia. In these cases, it is presumed that the transformed, overtly leukemic cell probably represented a subclone of the original &quot;preleukemic stem cell&quot; which secondarily acquired the additional genetic mutations required for the definitive block in differentiation and manifestation of the leukemic phenotype.

A systemic review which included data from 12,104 patients enrolled in randomized controlled clinical trials of cancer chemotherapy with G-CSF reported the following at a median follow-up time of 54 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated relative risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">AML/MDS</span> among patients assigned to receive G-CSF was 1.9 with an absolute increase in risk of 0.4 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated relative risk for mortality among patients assigned to receive G-CSF was 0.9 with an estimated absolute decrease of 3.4 percent.</p><p/><p>Despite a suggested increased risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">AML/MDS</span> among patients receiving G-CSF, patients who received G-CSF demonstrated superior survival.

These changes alter normal hematopoietic growth and differentiation, resulting in an accumulation of large numbers of abnormal, immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. These cells are capable of dividing and proliferating, but cannot differentiate into mature hematopoietic cells (ie, neutrophils).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AML is a heterogenous group of diseases characterized by clonal cells that exhibit maturation defects that correspond to stages in hematopoietic differentiation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cell of origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All leukemias, including AML, appear to be maintained by a pool of self-renewing malignant cells. These leukemic stem cells (also leukemia-initiating cells) may be more immature than the majority of circulating leukemic cells, and are thought to have originated from cells with existing self-renewal capacity or from progenitors that have re-acquired this stem cell-like property. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Leukemic stem cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;two-hit hypothesis&quot; of leukemogenesis implies that AML is the consequence of at least two mutations, one conferring a proliferative advantage (class I mutations) and another impairing hematopoietic differentiation (class II mutations). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Two-hit hypothesis of leukemogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukemogenic mutations can occur following chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, chemical exposure, and infection with retroviruses. In addition, certain familial disorders are associated with an increased incidence of AML.
