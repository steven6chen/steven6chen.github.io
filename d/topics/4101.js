Approximately 80 percent of sarcomas originate from soft tissue, and the rest originate from bone new cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The histopathologic spectrum of sarcomas is broad, presumably because the embryonic mesenchymal cells from which they arise have the capacity to mature into striated skeletal and smooth muscle, adipose and fibrous tissue, bone, and cartilage, among other tissues. Although ectodermal in origin, malignant tumors affecting peripheral nerves are included because of similarities in their clinical behavior, management, and outcome. </p><p>This topic review will cover the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma other than gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common sarcoma, which is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The most common subtypes that arise in adults are outlined in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112600 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>WHO classifies most soft tissue neoplasms according to the presumptive tissue of origin (ie, the normal tissues the tumor most closely resembles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Examples include liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), fibrosarcoma, and angiosarcoma. In some cases, histogenesis is uncertain, and the designation reflects the architectural pattern (eg, alveolar sarcoma of soft parts, epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma). </p><p>Histologically, the diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is made on the basis of morphologic pattern. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) often aids in the identification of the presumptive tissue of origin. Some IHC markers are more characteristic than others, and it is the spectrum of markers examined that determines the histological subtype. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desmin is particularly valuable in the identification of myogenic differentiation: RMS and, to a lesser degree, leiomyosarcoma.

Among sarcomas, these include clear cell sarcoma and perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComa). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokeratin is rarely expressed in most sarcomas but can help distinguish between synovial or epithelioid sarcoma (which both contain cytokeratin) and fibrosarcomas (which do not).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII-related antigen identifies tumors of endothelial origin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4236943809\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular diagnostics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of histologic subtypes are associated with specific chromosomal translocations; several examples are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64666 \">table 1</a>), and molecular techniques (including fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] to detect the protein products of these fusion genes) can aid in the diagnosis of these tumors. A prospective study has shown that molecular methods can modify expert histologic diagnoses in certain sarcomas, and argument has been made that such testing should be considered mandatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, in our view, the decision of such testing should be made by an experienced sarcoma pathologist taking into account the clinical information provided by a multidisciplinary care team. </p><p>Routine cytogenetics on fresh sarcoma specimens have largely been supplanted by FISH probes that can be performed on paraffin-embedded material. FISH testing can be definitive in ruling-in a specific sarcoma subtype in certain cases when the differential diagnosis has been narrowed but histology and IHC staining remain equivocal (eg, synovial sarcoma). However, when a translocation-associated tumor is highly suspected based upon the clinical presentation (eg, Ewing sarcoma), it is reasonable to send fresh tissue for cytogenetic analysis at the time of biopsy in consultation with the pathologist. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.

GIST are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, clinical presentation, prognostic features, and diagnostic work-up of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A brief description of some of the common subtypes follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liposarcoma</strong> &ndash; Liposarcomas appear to arise from precursors of adipocytes (fat cells) and are most commonly found in the extremities and retroperitoneum. The three main morphologic subgroups are <span class=\"nowrap\">well-differentiated/dedifferentiated,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell, and pleomorphic liposarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. There is a great range of biologic behavior amongst these subtypes, spanning from well-differentiated liposarcomas with low metastatic potential to the high-risk round cell or pleomorphic types, which tend to be higher grade and are associated with a high rate of distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12227226\" class=\"local\">'Histologic grade'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some well-differentiated liposarcomas arising on the extremities and trunk are referred to as &quot;atypical lipomas&quot; or atypical lipomatous tumors to denote the fact that, at these sites, excision is usually curative and that there is no potential for metastases, as compared with sites in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and spermatic cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in our view, this is a confusing name that underestimates the risk of local recurrence of such tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The metastatic pattern of the various subtypes of liposarcomas is also unique, with metastases to other soft tissue sites and bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">(myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma) more common than metastases to liver or lung (as may occur for pleomorphic liposarcomas or <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> sarcomas). (See <a href=\"#H12227114\" class=\"local\">'Pattern of recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Myxoid and round cell liposarcomas share the same reciprocal translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11), in which the <em>CHOP</em> gene (also called the DNA damage inducible transcript 3 [<em>DDIT3</em>] gene or <em>GADD153</em>) is inserted adjacent to a novel gene called <em>FUS</em> or <em>TLS</em> (translocated in liposarcoma). While no specific chromosomal translocations have been identified in <span class=\"nowrap\">well-differentiated/dedifferentiated</span> liposarcomas, amplification of <em>MDM2</em> and <em>CDK4</em> is very frequent in these subtypes, and their identification may be useful diagnostically. Furthermore, overexpression of the <em>MDM2</em> and <em>CDK4</em> genes is also being exploited for therapeutic gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Pleomorphic liposarcomas genetically most closely resemble the pleomorphic variant of <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> sarcomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Myxoid and round cell liposarcomas'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Somatic gene mutations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leiomyosarcoma</strong> &ndash; Leiomyosarcomas, which are characterized by smooth muscle differentiation, can be found throughout the body, including the retroperitoneum, any location where there is a vein, and the uterus. Leiomyosarcomas that originate in the uterus may be a distinct subgroup of tumors as they have different gene expression patterns when compared with nonuterine leiomyosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Uterine leiomyosarcomas are discussed in detail separately.

However, many sarcomas that were previously identified as MFH could be reclassified by many pathologists as other subtypes when reanalyzed using histology and IHC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The term <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> soft tissue sarcoma is now reserved specifically for sarcomas that lack specific lines of differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], although some pathologists use the term &quot;sarcoma, not otherwise specified (NOS)&quot; for these sarcomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsets of <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> soft tissue sarcomas include the pleomorphic (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma), round cell, and spindle cell variants, which simply describe histological morphology. One version of what was formerly termed myxoid MFH is now classified as a distinct sarcoma subtype, myxofibrosarcoma. In comparison with <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> soft tissue sarcoma, myxofibrosarcomas may be associated with a greater local recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Synovial sarcoma</strong> &ndash; Synovial sarcoma initially derived its name from a histologic resemblance to synovial cells, but its cell of origin is unknown. There are two morphologic subtypes, monophasic and biphasic. The most common presentation is a soft tissue tumor of the extremities in young adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The majority of synovial sarcomas are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11). The breakpoint of this translocation fuses the <em>SS18 </em>(previously called<em> SYT</em>) gene from chromosome 18 to one of three homologous genes, <em>SSX1</em>, <em>SSX2</em>, and <em>SSX4</em> on the X chromosome. <em>SS18-SSX1</em> is associated with biphasic tumors (glandular epithelial differentiation on a background of spindle tumor cells), while <em>SS18-SSX2</em> is associated with monophasic tumors that lack glandular epithelial differentiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cytogenetic analysis, FISH, or RT-PCR can be used to detect the translocation or the protein product of the fusion gene, thus aiding in the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. The specific <em>SS18-SSX</em> fusion type may have prognostic importance, with better outcomes reported for patients with the <em>SS18-SSX2</em> fusion in many, but not all, reports.

Approximately 50 percent of these tumors occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type I and result from degeneration of plexiform neurofibromas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-nerve-tumors#H30353503\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral nerve tumors&quot;, section on 'Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Neurofibromatosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1815266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Soft tissue sarcomas'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MPNSTs are commonly found in the trunk, extremities, and head and neck. The diagnosis of an MPNST can be difficult due to variable histomorphology. There are no characteristic chromosomal translocations. The presence of S100 protein can aid in the diagnosis, but it is not uniformly expressed in these tumors, since the line of differentiation appears to be lost to some degree in many.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiosarcoma</strong> &ndash; Angiosarcomas are uncommon tumors that arise in the subcutaneous tissue of many sites of the body, typically head and neck, or breast. It is one of the most common tumors caused by therapeutic radiation, often after treatment of breast cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma, with a median time of development of 8 to 10 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-sarcoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H30564621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Angiosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In IHC, the tumor cells stain positive for vascular markers such as CD31 and factor VIII. Mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2; also called <span class=\"nowrap\">Flk1/KDR)</span> are seen in a subset of these patients, with unclear clinical implications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of angiogenesis inhibitors&quot;, section on 'VEGF receptors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) </strong>&ndash; SFTs are slow-growing tumors that arise most commonly in the pleura, pelvis, or dura, where they can reach a very large size before detection due to their slow change over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solitary-fibrous-tumor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solitary fibrous tumor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H2388141401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While many SFTs are classified as benign tumors with a very low risk of metastasis, others are classified as malignant because of hypercellularity, at least focal cytologic atypia, tumor necrosis, numerous mitoses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infiltrative borders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These lesions have a greater ability to metastasize, usually at an interval of several years, most commonly to bone, liver, and lung. Tumor cells stain positive for stem cell marker CD34.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rare patients will present with hypoglycemia on the basis of overexpression of a form of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). This finding resolves with resection of the tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These tumors are commonly associated with an <em>NAB2-STAT6</em> fusion gene, which functions as a chimeric transcription factor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solitary-fibrous-tumor#H32709116\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solitary fibrous tumor&quot;, section on 'Molecular pathogenesis and molecular diagnostics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Desmoid <span class=\"nowrap\">tumor/deep</span> fibromatosis </strong>&ndash; Desmoid tumors, also referred to as aggressive or deep fibromatosis, are not sarcomas, but they represent neoplasms of fibroblastic tissue that lack the ability to metastasize. However, desmoid tumors have a propensity for local recurrence, even after complete resection, and they have the capacity to cause local morbidity and death in rare cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and local therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Desmoid tumors typically arise in the extremity in sporadic cases or in the abdominal wall in association with pregnancy (where they usually improve postpartum) and arise in the mesenteric root in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is characterized by loss of expression of the gene <em>APC</em>. The development of desmoid tumor in the setting of FAP is a characteristic of Gardner syndrome, a specific version of FAP. Mesenteric desmoids are those with the highest degree of mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><em>CTNNB1</em> gene mutations are found in most sporadic desmoids, although some, instead, have loss of the <em>APC</em> gene. The specific type of <em>CTNNB1</em> mutation may predict for risk of recurrence.</p><p/><p>Among children, who account for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of soft tissue sarcoma, the &quot;small round blue cell&quot; sarcomas predominate (eg, Ewing sarcoma, embryonal RMS, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET]). Central (supratentorial) PNET tumors are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to differentiate between the various subtypes of sarcoma for both prognosis and potential differences in treatment. This is especially true for typical pediatric tumors that arise in adults, such as RMS. Both embryonal and alveolar RMS are more susceptible to chemotherapy and carry a better prognosis than many types of adult soft tissue sarcomas. Nevertheless, pleomorphic RMS has a relatively poor prognosis compared with other RMS subtypes and predominates in adults, and outcomes are worse than in children.

The three-tiered system is incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for soft tissue sarcomas and is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].

These include genetic predisposition (eg, Li Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I), retinoblastoma, exposure to radiation therapy or chemotherapy, chemical carcinogens, chronic irritation, and lymphedema. In addition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human herpes virus 8 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma. These topics are discussed separately.

Tumors tend to grow along tissue planes and only rarely traverse or violate major fascial planes or bone. The growing tumor compresses surrounding normal tissue, leading to the formation of a so-called pseudocapsule that is comprised of compressed normal tissue with poorly defined margins and fingerlike tumor projections that infiltrate adjacent tissues. Dissection along the pseudocapsule plane will invariably leave residual disease and should be avoided.

A retrospective review performed in the United Kingdom found that CXR alone detected two-thirds of pulmonary metastases in patients with soft tissue sarcoma; when compared with CT as the &quot;gold standard,&quot; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CXR were 60.8, 99.6, 93.3, and 96.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The use of CXR only to stage the lungs would have missed one-third of all patients with lung metastases, but because of the infrequency of lung metastases overall (96 of 1170 patients), the initial staging would have been inaccurate in only 3.1 percent of cases. A greater proportion (4.9 percent) would have been incorrectly staged if CXR alone had been used in patients with high-grade, large, deep tumors.

In addition, an inappropriately placed diagnostic biopsy may preclude subsequent surgical resection, preparation of flaps, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic repair, or result in the need for a more extensive surgery to encompass the biopsy site at the time of definitive resection. Because of these issues, early referral of a patient with a suspicious soft tissue mass to a specialized center with a multidisciplinary sarcoma team is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H12227121\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our practice for the diagnostic workup of a soft tissue mass includes (see <a href=\"#H12227121\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a primary extremity lesion and computed tomography (CT) of a primary abdominal, visceral, or retroperitoneal lesion. (See <a href=\"#H7799658\" class=\"local\">'Imaging of the primary tumor'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Our preferred method of obtaining tissue is with a core needle biopsy, if technically feasible. If incisional biopsy is required, it should be carefully planned and performed by the surgeon who will be doing the definitive resection. A poorly placed initial biopsy may preclude subsequent surgical resection, preparation of flaps, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic repair, or result in the need for a more extensive surgery to encompass the biopsy site at the time of definitive resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We recommend that all pathology specimens of suspected soft tissue sarcomas be reviewed by a pathologist who specializes in the evaluation of soft tissue tumors. (See <a href=\"#H12227177\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the diagnosis of a sarcoma is established, we recommend chest imaging to evaluate for pulmonary metastatic disease in all patients; we use chest CT rather than chest radiograph in patients with a high risk of pulmonary metastases (tumors &gt;5 cm, deep-seated, or intermediate or high grade). We also recommend CT of the abdomen and pelvis in round <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/myxoid</span> liposarcomas due to the common presentation of extrapulmonary metastases to the abdomen and retroperitoneum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Imaging of the brain is suggested for patients with angiosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma due to the high propensity of these tumors for central nervous system metastases. (See <a href=\"#H12227170\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for metastatic disease'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not routinely perform positron emission tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in the initial staging evaluation of a newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma. PET or gallium scan may be of value in a patient with neurofibromatosis as an aid to differentiating between a plexiform neurofibroma and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. (See <a href=\"#H12227163\" class=\"local\">'PET and PET/CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4377878\" class=\"local\">'Role of PET scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bone scan is not helpful for initial staging of soft tissue sarcomas. (See <a href=\"#H12227170\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue sarcomas are staged according to the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system, which is based on tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), distant metastases (M), and histologic grade (G).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most recent (eighth edition, 2017) version of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> staging manual has separate T staging criteria and prognostic stage groups for soft tissue sarcoma arising in the <span class=\"nowrap\">extremity/trunk</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110711 \">table 3</a>) and retroperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110713 \">table 2</a>); in addition, there are unique primary tumor definitions for sarcomas of the viscera of the abdomen and thorax but no recommended prognostic stage groupings at this site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110739 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/37,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,97</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H351701269\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The TNM staging system is not in widespread use for retroperitoneal sarcomas. It does not account for disease site or histology, two major prognostic indicators. In addition, its ability to discriminate outcome is limited. Because of this, the AJCC specifically recommends the use of a prognostic nomogram to estimate the likelihood of postoperative survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98038\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98038 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to tumor stage, other prognostic variables include anatomic site, patient age, and histologic subtype. A nomogram developed by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is available online to aid in predicting survival and treatment decision-making for individual patients.
