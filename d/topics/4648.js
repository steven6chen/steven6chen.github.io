(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rhabdomyolysis may be due to either traumatic or nontraumatic muscle injury. Much of our knowledge on rhabdomyolysis-associated ATN derives from observations of traumatic rhabdomyolysis that forms the basis for development of the crush syndrome resulting from large-scale, natural or manmade disasters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Treatment of both acute and chronic kidney diseases after disasters deserves special mention because it almost always requires complex technology and equipment. Crush syndrome-related AKI is the most frequent acute kidney problem after mass disasters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and prevention of AKI due to traumatic rhabdomyolysis will be reviewed here. ATN due to nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis and general overviews of rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and drug-induced myopathies are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced myopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic manifestations that are induced by crush injury are often referred to as crush syndrome. Crush syndrome develops in 30 to 50 percent of cases of traumatic rhabdomyolysis and is frequently seen after catastrophic earthquakes. According to some estimates, the incidence of crush syndrome ranges between 2 and 5 percent of all injured victims of catastrophic earthquakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. All disaster victims, irrespective of whether they are mildly or severely injured, should be considered at increased risk.</p><p>The incidence of AKI and the frequency with which dialysis is required in these cases have varied widely in different studies. The following reports have analyzed these aspects as part of crush injury following catastrophic earthquakes.</p><p>In a report from Bam, Iran, dialysis was required in 6.5 percent of 1975 patients admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The majority of victims were rescued in less than four hours. In contrast to other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], the authors detected a direct correlation between time under the rubble and outcome. The short time under the rubble might thus explain, at least in part, the lower rate of requiring dialysis in Bam compared with other reports, although this is not entirely certain.</p><p>Much higher rates of dialysis requirement were noted in two other catastrophic earthquakes: 54 percent in the Kobe earthquake and 75 percent in the Marmara earthquake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. In the Kobe earthquake, the need for hemodialysis correlated directly with increased serum creatine kinase (CK) levels as dialysis was required in 84 and 39 percent of patients with a CK level greater or less than 75,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the Kobe and Marmara earthquakes, the time under the rubble correlated inversely with both serum CK and the frequency of requiring dialysis. A possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is that victims with more extensive muscle injury and higher CK levels died before they were extricated and transported to the hospital.</p><p>Although not many other natural disasters cause traumatic rhabdomyolysis, a number of manmade disasters may do so (such as terrorist attacks, mining accidents, wars, and torture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30874404\"><span class=\"h2\">Compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most typical local finding of traumatic rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome due to swollen muscles. Patients suffer from severe pain, weakness, paresthesia, paresis or paralysis, and pallor in the affected extremities. Distal pulses may be absent when intracompartmental pressure is very high, although increased intracompartmental pressure may be present, even when distal pulses are palpable. In traumatic rhabdomyolysis, signs of penetrating or, more frequently, blunt trauma may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H122605572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Extremity evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypovolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with rhabdomyolysis have been immobile or comatose for significant periods of time. As a result, hypovolemia due to absence of fluid intake plus ongoing losses may be observed. This is particularly important among patients with rhabdomyolysis due to crush injury since they may have been immobilized for hours to days. In addition, third spacing at the site of muscle injury (compartment syndrome) among such patients significantly worsens hypovolemia. The latter phenomenon typically starts only after decompression due to reperfusion of the traumatized muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dark urine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic manifestation of heme pigment-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is discolored urine. Marked release of myoglobin leads to red or brown (or even black) urine, unless pigment excretion is limited, because of a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), extreme dilution of the urine due to preventive fluid administration, or clearance of myoglobin from the plasma by the reticuloendothelial system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Urinalysis also reveals pigmented granular casts.</p><p>The plasma is typically normal in color with myoglobinuria. This is in contrast to conditions resulting in hemoglobinuria-induced ATN, such as massive hemolysis, which are characterized by red-tinted plasma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>). The reason for normal-colored plasma may be that massive rhabdomyolysis is required for a color change. However, such extensive rhabdomyolysis is almost always associated with fatal hyperkalemia; thus, these patients die before admitting to hospitals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of renal insufficiency ranges widely from a mild elevation in the serum creatinine concentration to oliguric AKI requiring immediate hemodialysis. This variability is due to differences in severity of injury to muscle and presence or absence of volume depletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying, additional comorbid conditions, particularly sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. AKI resulting from heme pigment-induced ATN is usually characterized by an initial oliguric period, followed by polyuria, which usually starts within one to three weeks after the primary event. Some cases may present with a nonoliguric course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30874451\"><span class=\"h2\">Other clinical problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other systemic manifestations of crush syndrome may include, but are not limited to, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, bleeding diathesis, cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and psychological trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOCHEMICAL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biochemical abnormalities that characterize rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI include hyperkalemia that may be life threatening, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia (which is occasionally followed by hypercalcemia during the recovery stage), a high creatine kinase (CK), and a low fractional excretion of sodium. These are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>). High serum levels of myoglobin are very rarely detected because of the short half-life of myoglobin. In addition, myoglobin is cleared very quickly from the plasma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with rhabdomyolysis-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) typically present with a red to brown color of the urine without presence of erythrocytes at microscopic examination, pigmented granular casts in the urinary sediment, varying severity of kidney dysfunction, and a marked elevation in the plasma creatine kinase (CK) level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intermittent excretion of red to brown urine can be seen in a variety of clinical settings, including heme pigment-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The approach to this issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>.)</p><p>AKI can also be caused by other conditions or abnormalities commonly observed in patients with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. These include drug-induced AKI (such as aminoglycosides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), sepsis, severe hypotension due to marked hypovolemia, and others. This is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general goals for preventive therapy in all cases of heme pigment-induced AKI are to both enhance renal perfusion (thereby minimizing ischemic injury) and increase the urine flow rate to wash out obstructing casts. Volume resuscitation should be initiated before the crush is relieved or as soon as possible thereafter, before heme pigment and other intracellular elements have been released into the circulation and before third spacing at the site of muscle injury worsens hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/2,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21-23</a>]. In the case of disaster, preventive measures should be applied to crush victims already at the disaster field, in the field hospitals, during transportation to the hospitals, and after admission to regular hospitals.</p><p>The most important preventive measure at the disaster field is the correction of volume depletion. During volume resuscitation, the timing and rate of fluid administration, volume of fluids, and also types of fluid are important elements to consider.</p><p>The approach to prevention of AKI also may vary based upon the location of the patient and ability to closely monitor the victim or not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Before and during extrication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive fluid repletion should be started before the extrication of entrapped subjects prone to develop the crush syndrome, if possible. Third spacing at the site of muscle injury worsens hypovolemia. Thus, patients with rhabdomyolysis may require massive amounts of fluid (even up to 20 liters) to initiate and maintain a vigorous diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale of early and generous volume resuscitation is based upon the observations that early adequate fluid resuscitation is very important to help prevent AKI in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to crush injury.</p><p>Practically all of the published experience with volume resuscitation in patients with heme pigment-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) has come from retrospective reports of rhabdomyolysis in subjects with crush injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/2-4,21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,21,23,24</a>]. The following studies serve as examples of the importance of early fluid repletion in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven patients with crush syndrome who were trapped under rubble (all with creatine kinase [CK] concentrations &gt;30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> were treated with alkaline diuresis immediately after extrication; none developed renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. One patient who did not receive prophylactic volume repletion developed AKI and required hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixteen earthquake victims trapped for a mean of 10 hours (12 had CK concentrations &gt;20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> were treated initially with isotonic saline at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour,</span> then with an alkaline-mannitol solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The four patients who required dialysis were treated approximately nine hours after extrication and received significantly less fluids compared with 12 patients who did not require dialysis and who were treated four hours after extrication with more massive quantities of fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other reports of earthquake-related crush injury, AKI occurred in over 50 percent of patients for whom therapy was instituted much later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p/><p>However, in the aftermath of the Marmara earthquake, more extensive fluid administration was unexpectedly associated with a more frequent need for dialysis. This seemingly contradictory finding may be explained by the fact that many victims had already established AKI when they were admitted to hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In such cases, delayed fluid resuscitation might result in hypervolemia and a subsequent higher need for dialysis. Therefore, this finding does not indicate that disaster victims should receive less fluid in order to avoid dialysis, but underscores that, once AKI is established, the risk of volume overload is substantial. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of established acute kidney injury'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal type and rate of fluid repletion are unclear. No studies have directly compared the efficacy and safety of different types and rates of fluid administration in this setting.</p><p>Prior to and during extrication, we agree with the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force (RDRTF) of the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) that isotonic saline, rather than isotonic bicarbonate, be administered because saline solutions are more readily available in disasters and have a well-described efficacy for volume replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. If available, isotonic saline plus 5 percent dextrose may be used since it provides the advantage of supplying calories and attenuating hyperkalemia.</p><p>Isotonic saline should initially be given at a rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour</span> (10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight per hour) while the victim is still under the rubble (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108672\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108672 \">algorithm 1</a>). After 2 liters are given, the rate of administration should be decreased to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> to avoid volume overload. However, this volume should be individualized. Factors to consider are age (fluid administration should be performed more carefully in older adults); body mass index (more fluids are needed for the victims with larger body volume); trauma pattern (more fluid is needed in patients with more serious trauma); and amount of presumed fluid losses (more fluids are needed in hot climates and in victims who produce urine or have ongoing blood losses).</p><p>There is a potential role for isotonic bicarbonate therapy after extrication (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Use of bicarbonate'</a> below), but this application is hampered in the aftermath of mass disasters for practical reasons (eg, availability).</p><p>Severe hyperkalemia is relatively frequent among patients with crush injuries. As a result, intravenous solutions containing potassium, such as Ringer's lactate, are contraindicated in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428143791\"><span class=\"h2\">After extrication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extricated victims should be evacuated as quickly as possible from the site of structural collapse. Vital signs should be checked and a primary survey performed to define the extent and type of medical and surgical interventions needed. Victims with a low potential for survival should be triaged to determine who should receive priority for treatment. Afterwards, an initial systematic assessment of the injured patient should be performed to identify any life-threatening injuries and to prioritize urgent therapeutic needs. Hydration status of victims should be evaluated to determine the volume of fluids required. If no intravenous fluid was given prior to extraction, intravenous isotonic saline at a rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour</span> for adults should be initiated as soon as possible after rescue. The victim should be evaluated regularly, and urinary output should be monitored at least six hours while administering 3 to 6 L of fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108672\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108672 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of bicarbonate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After urine output has been documented and overt alkalosis has been excluded, we agree with the RDRTF that an alkaline solution that is approximately isotonic may be used where feasible (such as in small-scale disasters) in an attempt to achieve a forced alkaline diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the use of complex solutions such as bicarbonate-containing solutions may be limited by logistic circumstances in mass disasters. The preparation of such solutions is time consuming and carries the risk of contamination and error in preparation.</p><p>The rationale for this approach is that raising the urine pH above 6.5 may prevent heme-protein precipitation with Tamm-Horsfall protein, intratubular pigment cast formation, and uric acid precipitation; correct metabolic acidosis; and reduce hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1,3,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,28</a>]. Alkalinization may also decrease the release of free iron from myoglobin and the formation of F2-isoprostanes, which may enhance renal vasoconstriction. Administration of isotonic bicarbonate instead of NaCl may also prevent chloride accumulation and subsequent hyperchloremic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these potential benefits, there is no clear clinical evidence that an alkaline diuresis is more effective than a saline diuresis in preventing AKI as no direct comparative trial has been performed. The best data in support of an alkaline diuresis are derived from uncontrolled case series. In a study cited above, for example, renal failure did not develop in seven patients with crush syndrome who were trapped under rubble and were treated with alkaline diuresis immediately after extrication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. By comparison, one patient who did not receive prophylactic volume developed AKI and required hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The optimal regimen and rate of administration of bicarbonate are unknown. We generally administer one of the following two fluid regimens after extrication:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One liter of isotonic saline alternating with 1 liter of half-isotonic saline plus 50 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isotonic saline for the first two liters, followed by 1 liter of half-isotonic saline plus 50 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. This sequence is then repeated, as indicated.</p><p/><p>The choice between these two regimens depends in part upon the general clinical and biochemical condition of the patient and the blood pH. As an example, if measured laboratory values reflect only a mild acidosis, more liters of isotonic saline and fewer liters of bicarbonate-containing solution are given.</p><p>The rate of fluid administration with either regimen is based upon the ability to attain urinary output goals and assessment of volume status. In general, we administer the intravenous solution at 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for the first 24 hours, as long as there is no evidence of fluid overload and the patient can be closely monitored. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Urine output goal'</a> below.)</p><p>The rate of fluid administration is decreased after the first 24 hours but is still maintained at a rate that is greater than the urine output, as long as there is no evidence of fluid overload. Generally, a total of 200 to 300 mEq of bicarbonate is given on the first day, as long as the patient is not alkalemic. The exact rate and regimen are altered based upon ongoing clinical assessment and laboratory values. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Urine output goal'</a> below.)</p><p>Potential risks associated with alkalinization of the plasma include promoting calcium phosphate deposition and inducing or worsening the manifestations of hypocalcemia by both a direct membrane effect and a reduction in ionized calcium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Manifestations of severe ionized hypocalcemia include tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias. To minimize the risk of these complications, the arterial pH should not exceed 7.5. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alkalinization can also reduce the plasma potassium concentration secondary to intracellular shift. This is often a beneficial effect since the combination of tissue breakdown and renal failure often leads to hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Increased entry into cells'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the potential risks with bicarbonate therapy, we recommend close monitoring of serum bicarbonate, calcium, and potassium and the urine pH. The urine pH can be measured by immersion of a simple urine dipstick, but this is only reliable on freshly voided urine, unless urine is collected under paraffin (which is difficult to obtain). The target urine pH is &gt;6.5. We recommend discontinuing the bicarbonate-containing solution (but continuing to replete volume with isotonic saline) if the arterial pH exceeds 7.5, the serum bicarbonate exceeds 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> or the patient develops symptomatic hypocalcemia. Calcium supplementation should be given only for symptomatic hypocalcemia or severe hyperkalemia since early deposition of calcium in muscle is followed by hypercalcemia later in the recovery process.

In addition to these beneficial effects on the kidney, mannitol may extract sequestered water from the injured muscles, thus preventing compartmental syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>However, at least some studies have shown no amelioration of proximal tubular necrosis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, and mannitol may cause hyperosmolality and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Mannitol administered in very high doses or to patients with reduced renal excretion due to renal insufficiency can also raise plasma osmolality sufficiently to cause symptoms of hyperosmolality and volume expansion. The increase in plasma osmolality can also cause passive movement of potassium out of cells and raise the plasma potassium concentration. AKI may occur if patients are treated with more than 200 g of mannitol per day.

Catheters carry a risk of infection, especially in the chaos accompanying most disasters.

Absolute values are increased not only in hypervolemia, but also in other disease states, such as cardiac failure.
