They were originally termed choledochal cysts due to their involvement of the extrahepatic bile duct. However, the original clinical classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] was revised in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Biliary cysts are associated with significant complications such as ductal strictures, stone formation, cholangitis, rupture, and secondary biliary cirrhosis. In addition, certain types of biliary cysts have a high risk of malignancy. </p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of biliary cysts. Cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and a detailed discussion of type V biliary cysts (Caroli disease) are discussed elsewhere.

It was expanded in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and further refined in 2003 to incorporate the presence of an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction'</a> below.) </p><p>The classification scheme defines six types of biliary cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type I cysts</strong> (50 to 85 percent of cysts) &ndash; Type I cysts are characterized by cystic or fusiform dilation of the common bile duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62324\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62324 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Type I cysts do not involve the intrahepatic bile ducts. Type I cysts are further subcategorized as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IA</strong> &ndash; Cystic dilation of the common bile duct, as well as part or all of the common hepatic duct and extrahepatic portions of the left and right hepatic ducts. Type IA cysts are associated with an APBJ. The cystic duct and gallbladder arise from the dilated common bile duct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IB</strong> &ndash; Focal, segmental dilation of an extrahepatic bile duct (often the distal common bile duct). Type IB cysts are not associated with an APBJ. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IC</strong> &ndash; Smooth, fusiform (as opposed to cystic) dilation of all the extrahepatic bile ducts. Typically, the dilation extends from the pancreatobiliary junction to the extrahepatic portions of the left and right hepatic ducts. Type IC cysts are associated with an APBJ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type ID</strong> &ndash; Cystic dilation of the common duct and cystic duct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type II cysts </strong>(2 percent of cysts) &ndash; Type II cysts are true diverticula of the extrahepatic bile ducts and communicate with the bile duct through a narrow stalk. They may arise from any portion of the extrahepatic bile duct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type III cysts </strong>(1 to 5 percent of cysts) &ndash; Type III cysts are cystic dilations limited to the intraduodenal portion of the distal common bile duct and are also known as choledochoceles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81700 \">figure 2</a>). Type III cysts can be lined by duodenal or biliary epithelium and may arise embryologically as duodenal duplications involving the ampulla. As many as five subtypes have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; however, most commonly they are subdivided into two types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IIIA</strong> &ndash; The bile duct and pancreatic duct enter the cyst, which then drains into the duodenum at a separate orifice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IIIB</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A diverticulum of the intraduodenal common bile duct or intra-ampullary common ductal channel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type IV cysts </strong>(15 to 35 percent of cysts) &ndash; Type IV cysts are defined by the presence of multiple cysts and are subdivided based on their intrahepatic bile duct involvement: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IVA </strong>&ndash; Both intrahepatic and extrahepatic cystic dilations. Type IVA is the second most common type of biliary cyst and is often associated with a distinct change in duct caliber <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a stricture at the hilum, features that help differentiate it from a type IC cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Type IVB</strong> &ndash; Multiple extrahepatic cysts but no intrahepatic cysts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type V cysts</strong> (20 percent of cysts) &ndash; Type V cysts are characterized by one or more cystic dilations of the intrahepatic ducts, without extrahepatic duct disease. The presence of multiple saccular or cystic dilations of the intrahepatic ducts is known as Caroli disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caroli-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caroli disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type VI cysts </strong>(rare) &ndash; Isolated cystic dilatations of the cystic duct.</p><p/><p>This classification system does not include rare cases of cystic duct cysts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61950359\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of biliary cysts in Western populations has been estimated to be 1:100,000 to 1:150,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence is higher in some Asian countries (up to 1:1000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], with between one-half and two-thirds of the reported cases occurring in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. A report from Finland suggests that the incidence of biliary cysts has increased from 1:128,000 to 1:38,000 over the past 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Biliary cysts are more common in women, with a female to male ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/2,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,12</a>]. In the past, the majority of cases were reported in children, although more recent series report equal numbers in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several theories of biliary cyst formation have been proposed, and it is likely that no one mechanism accounts for all biliary cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In many patients, an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction appears to play an important role. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction'</a> below.) </p><p>Cysts may be congenital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] or acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and have been associated with a variety of anatomic abnormalities. A genetic or environmental predisposition to biliary cysts is suggested by reports of the familial occurrence of cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and by the increased incidence in some Asian countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61949987\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental anomalies associated with biliary cysts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary atresia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duodenal atresia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic atresia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imperforate anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiseptate gallbladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemifacial microsomia with extracraniofacial anomalies (OMENS plus syndrome) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular septal defect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic hypoplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital absence of the portal vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterotopic pancreatic tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial adenomatous polyposis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61949993\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital cysts may result from an unequal proliferation of embryologic biliary epithelial cells before bile duct cannulation is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Fetal viral infection may also have a role, as reovirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from biliary tissue of neonates with infantile biliary obstruction and biliary cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, cyst formation may be the result of ductal obstruction or distension during the prenatal or neonatal period. In a sheep model, bile duct ligation in neonates led to cyst formation, whereas duct ligation in adult animals led to gallbladder distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some biliary cysts may be the result of an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ), also called pancreaticobiliary maljunction or malunion. The APBJ may allow reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tree with resultant damage to the biliary epithelium and cyst formation.</p><p>While APBJ is a rare congenital anomaly, with a prevalence of 0.03 percent in one population-based series from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], it is present in 50 to 80 percent of patients with biliary cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77946\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77946 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57937\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57937 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62324\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62324 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. An APBJ may also be a significant risk factor for the development of malignancy within a biliary cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H67100904\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal pancreatobiliary junction and cancer'</a> below.)</p><p>APBJ is characterized by a junction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct outside the duodenal wall with a long common ductal channel leading to the duodenal lumen (at least 8 mm, and often over 20 mm, in length) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. APBJ may result from failure of the embryological ducts to migrate fully into the duodenum. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that the ampulla of Vater is diminutive or flat in patients with APBJ. In one series, the papilla was displaced distally in the duodenum of patients with APBJ, with the distal displacement of the papilla corresponding to the length of the common channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A long common channel may predispose to reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tree since the ductal junction lies outside of the duodenal wall and the sphincter of Oddi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This can result in increased amylase levels in bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], intraductal activation of proteolytic enzymes, and alterations in bile composition. A bile amylase concentration of &gt;8,000 International <span class=\"nowrap\">Unites/L</span> may be considered diagnostic of an APBJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These changes in the composition of bile could theoretically lead to biliary epithelial damage with inflammation, ductal distension, and eventually, cyst formation. Elevated sphincter of Oddi pressures have been documented in APBJ and could promote pancreaticobiliary reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1268888981\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely Type 1 biliary cysts can occur after cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one series that included 27 patients, six had an APBJ, and 21 had elevated bile amylase levels diagnostic of pancreaticobiliary reflux. Sphincter of Oddi stenosis could account for cyst formation in these patients. The risk of biliary malignancy in such patients is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1465186\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic features of biliary cysts are variable, ranging from normal bile duct mucosa to carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>]. More commonly in children, there is a densely fibrotic cyst wall with evidence of chronic and acute inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In adults, there are frequently inflammatory changes, erosions, sparse distribution of mucin glands, and not infrequently, metaplasia and biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN), precursors of cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35,36</a>]. Malignancy, when present, is most commonly found in the posterior cyst wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In the case of type III cysts, the cyst is usually lined by duodenal mucosa and less commonly by bile duct epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1464909\" class=\"local\">'Types of biliary cysts'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67100690\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with biliary cysts will present before the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The classic presentation includes the triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and a palpable mass, and is more common in children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the majority of patients will only have one or two elements of the triad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,39</a>]. Patients may also report nausea, vomiting, fever, pruritus, and weight loss. Neonates typically present with obstructive jaundice and abdominal masses whereas adults frequently present with pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Biliary cysts may also be an incidental finding during prenatal ultrasonography or in an asymptomatic patient who is undergoing imaging or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for other reasons.</p><p>Patients may also present with signs and symptoms related to complications associated with biliary cysts, including pancreatitis, cholangitis, and obstructive jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H67101193\" class=\"local\">'Complications other than cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67101020\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum liver tests are often normal in patients with biliary cysts. In the presence of an obstructing stone, stricture, or malignancy, serum liver tests will typically be elevated in a cholestatic pattern (disproportionate elevations of the alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin relative to the aminotransferases). Laboratory evidence of complications may also be present (eg, elevated pancreatic enzymes with pancreatitis, elevated white blood cell count with cholangitis). (See <a href=\"#H67101193\" class=\"local\">'Complications other than cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67100188\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Cancer is more common in patients who are older and in those with type I and IV cysts. Because of the increased risk of malignancy, it is recommended that patients with type I or IV cysts have the cysts completely removed with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The risk of cancer appears to be lower in patients with type II or III cysts. Patients with type II cysts can often be treated with simple cyst excision, while those with type III cysts can be treated with sphincterotomy or endoscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with type V cysts have a moderate risk of cancer, but because of the intrahepatic nature of the cysts, treatment can be difficult and some patients require liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caroli-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caroli disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Overall, the incidence of cancer is reported to be in the range of 10 to 30 percent with a mean age at diagnosis of 32 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. However, the cited statistics likely overestimate the risk of cancer in biliary cysts because most series include only symptomatic patients presenting with complications, including malignancy. To calculate the true risk of malignant degeneration, the incidence of asymptomatic biliary cysts in the population should be used as the denominator, a value that is unknown. If patients who developed malignancy at least two years after initial diagnosis of their cyst are studied, the incidence appears lower (4.5 percent rather than 14 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, evidence clearly points to a 20- to 30-fold increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma in biliary cysts compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This evidence includes the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients as young as 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], the occurrence of synchronous and metachronous biliary cancers, and the subsequent development of cancer in patients with incompletely resected cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The possibility of cancer should always be considered in an adult with a newly diagnosed biliary cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67100770\"><span class=\"h3\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of malignancy increases with age. In two reviews of all published series of biliary cysts, the incidence of cancer was 0.4 percent in patients under 18 years of age, and 11 percent in all adults. Among adults, the incidence increased with each decade of life from 5 percent in patients 18 to 30 years of age to 38 percent in patients over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Some studies have reported a cancer incidence as high as 50 percent in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67100717\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyst type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer has been associated with all subtypes of biliary cysts, but is probably most common in type I and type IV cysts. In one series, 68 percent of the malignancies occurred in patients with type I cysts, and 21 percent occurred in patients with type IV cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Patients with type II cysts and type III cysts accounted for 5 and 2 percent of cases, respectively. Cancer in patients with type III cysts may be limited to those with cysts lined by biliary, rather than duodenal, epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A high level of suspicion is required for diagnosis, particularly for type I cysts, which may go undiagnosed unless considered in the differential diagnosis of patients found to have ductal dilation. The diagnosis can typically be made with a combination of transabdominal ultrasonography and cross-sectional imaging. Additional testing may be required to rule out biliary obstruction (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]) or to confirm communication of the cyst with the biliary tree (hepatobiliary scintigraphy or ERCP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74952950\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having biliary cysts should undergo an evaluation to confirm the presence of the cysts and to determine whether there is communication between the cysts and the biliary tree. Cysts are often first suspected based on the findings from transabdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) in a patient being evaluated for abdominal pain, jaundice, or an abdominal mass. With the widespread use of CT and MR, many cysts are now discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging performed for an unrelated reason. It is important to consider a biliary cyst in a patient found to have a dilated bile duct or cystic liver lesion(s).

This nuclear medicine examination uses a radiolabeled bile salt (technetium-99m-labeled hepatic iminodiacetic acid [HIDA]), which is injected intravenously and is then selectively taken up by hepatocytes and excreted into the bile. In patients with extrahepatic biliary cysts, the characteristic appearance is of an ovoid or spherical photon-deficient area that shows progressive radiotracer accumulation on delayed imaging (&gt;2 hours after injection), with persistent pooling of activity seen for up to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. This appearance is seen in over 80 percent of extrahepatic biliary cysts.

If doubt remains after cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]), hepatobiliary scintigraphy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be performed to confirm that the cyst communicates with the biliary tree.

Such patients usually present with jaundice or elevated serum liver tests, have a readily identifiable obstructing lesion such as a stone, stricture, or mass, and their biliary dilation often improves after appropriate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. A careful evaluation for an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction (eg, with ERCP) may help with diagnosis in indeterminate cases.

Patients with type I, II, or IV cysts usually undergo surgical resection of the cysts due to the significant risk of malignancy, provided they are good surgical candidates. Type I and IV cysts should be completely resected with creation of a Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy. Serial sections from the cyst wall should be examined by the pathologist to look for any malignant changes. Type II cysts can be treated with simple cyst excision. Type III cysts (choledochoceles) require treatment if they are symptomatic and may be managed with sphincterotomy or endoscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Treatment for type V cysts is largely supportive and is aimed at dealing with problems such as recurrent cholangitis and sepsis. Type V cysts can be difficult to manage, and some patients with type V cysts eventually require liver transplantation.</p><p>Regardless of the type of cyst, patients with ascending cholangitis require treatment with antibiotics and drainage. Drainage of an obstructed and infected bile duct can usually be obtained via endoscopic stent placement, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage, or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.

The approach is advocated because of the risk of malignancy associated with these cysts. In addition to decreasing the risk of malignancy, cyst excision can reduce complications such as recurrent cholangitis, cystolithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis. Surgical treatment by cyst-enterostomy rather than resection is associated with poorer short- and long-term outcomes, with a higher risk of subsequent malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The lower resection margin depends on the distal extent of the cyst.

In some cases, excision of the cyst may be complicated by its relationship to nearby structures. If dissection of a cyst from the portal vein or hepatic artery is technically difficult, some surgeons advocate leaving the posterior cyst wall intact and performing a mucosectomy (removal of the epithelial lining of the cyst) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The mucosectomy is performed in an attempt to decrease the risk of malignancy. </p><p>The relationship of type I cysts to the pancreatic head can also complicate cyst removal. The intrapancreatic portion of type I cysts can generally be treated with intramural dissection of the bile duct down to the pancreaticobiliary junction without pancreatic head resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. If left in place, the intrapancreatic portion of a type I cyst can be associated with subsequent malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] or stone formation in the cyst remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>The most frequent long-term complication of hepaticojejunostomy is stenosis of the biliary-enteric anastomosis leading to cholangitis, jaundice, or cirrhosis.

Because malignancy has rarely been reported in type IIIA cysts, endoscopic biopsies of the cyst epithelium should be obtained following sphincterotomy to determine if the cyst is lined by duodenal or biliary mucosa (the latter being associated with an increased risk of malignancy), and to exclude dysplasia. Endoscopic snare resection of type IIIA cysts can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Type IIIB cysts may be resected surgically or endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1466490\"><span class=\"h2\">Type V cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with type IVA cysts, the intrahepatic cysts in patients with type V biliary cysts can be difficult to manage. Treatment for type V cysts is largely supportive and is aimed at dealing with problems such as recurrent cholangitis and sepsis. Some patients with type V cysts will eventually require liver transplantation. The treatment of patients with type V cysts is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caroli-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caroli disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67101917\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction (APBJ) and no biliary cyst should undergo prophylactic cholecystectomy because of the increased risk of gallbladder cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction and a dilated common channel may develop proteinaceous plugs or stones within the common channel, resulting in ductal obstruction and pancreatitis. In such patients, cyst resection alone may not lead to symptom resolution. Surgical or endoscopic removal of stones or protein plugs from the common channel and surgical sphincteroplasty or endoscopic sphincterotomy may also be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61950554\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who have undergone cystenterostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, some patients with type I or IV biliary cysts were treated with internal drainage via a cystenterostomy. While effective at treating symptoms, the procedure was associated with significant complications such as ascending cholangitis due to reflux of enteric contents into the cyst and biliary tree, anastomotic stricture formation, and most importantly, a 30 percent postoperative risk of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/83,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,88</a>]. Patients who have previously undergone cystenterostomy should undergo surgery to completely remove the cyst.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67101754\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives to surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with type I, II, or IV biliary cysts who refuse surgical resection or who are poor surgical candidates, lesser interventions (such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, endoscopic sphincterotomy, or endoscopic stent placement) may treat symptoms caused by gallstones or sludge. There is no proven effective method of screening biliary cysts for dysplasia or intramucosal cancer. If screening is attempted, intraductal ultrasound (performed via ERCP) is probably the most sensitive test for detecting early malignancy in the cyst wall. A less invasive approach is to perform periodic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast and MRCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraductal-ultrasound-of-the-pancreaticobiliary-ductal-system#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraductal ultrasound of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system&quot;, section on 'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61950961\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the carcinoma risk is decreased in patients who have undergone cyst resection, these patients continue to be at increased risk of carcinoma in the remaining biliary tree compared with the general population. Post-excisional malignant disease is seen in 0.7 to 6 percent of patients and may be due to remnant cyst tissue or subclinical malignant disease that was not detected prior to cyst excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/43,44,80,89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,80,89,90</a>]. Malignancy may develop in portions of cysts that were left behind at surgery, at the anastomotic site, or in the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-cysts/abstract/43,44,91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,91-93</a>]. </p><p>The appropriate follow-up for patients who have been treated for a biliary cyst is unclear. For those who have undergone total cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy, annual serum liver tests are warranted to screen for anastomotic biliary stenosis. For those who have undergone partial cyst excision or who refuse cyst excision, the value of periodic imaging tests to screen for malignancy is unproven. It is reasonable to consider yearly imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography with contrast, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraductal ultrasound) in such patients to assess for early malignant change, particularly if findings will alter patient management. For those with type III cysts treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy, it is reasonable to perform endoscopic biopsies of the cyst mucosa, both at the time of sphincterotomy and a year later, to assess for dysplasia. Patients with malignancy in the resected cyst may require additional treatment and follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1466662\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilations that may occur singly or in multiples throughout the biliary tree. Biliary cysts can lead to significant complications such as ductal strictures, stone formation, cholangitis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, rupture, and cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classification scheme for biliary cysts takes into account cyst location, cyst number, and whether there is an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80937 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1464909\" class=\"local\">'Types of biliary cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic presentation of a biliary cyst includes the triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and a palpable mass. However, the majority of patients will only have one or two elements of the triad. Patients may also report nausea, vomiting, fever, pruritus, and weight loss. Biliary cysts may also be an incidental finding during prenatal ultrasonography or in an asymptomatic patient who is undergoing imaging or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary cysts are associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly cholangiocarcinoma. Overall, the incidence of cancer is reported to be in the range of 10 to 30 percent, though published reports may overestimate the true incidence. Cancer is more common in patients who are older and in those with type I and IV cysts. The risk of cancer is lower in patients with type II or III cysts. Cancer is reported in 7 to 15 percent of patients with type V cysts. (See <a href=\"#H67100188\" class=\"local\">'Cancer risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary cysts are typically diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging. Additional testing may be required to rule out biliary obstruction (ERCP or endoscopic ultrasound) or to confirm communication of the cyst with the biliary tree (hepatobiliary scintigraphy or ERCP). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with biliary cysts depends on the cyst type and whether the patient has symptoms. For cysts with high malignant potential, resection decreases (but does not eliminate) the risk of malignancy. In addition to decreasing the risk of malignancy, the excision of cysts can reduce complications such as recurrent cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H61950961\" class=\"local\">'Patient follow-up'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with type I or IV cysts, we recommend complete surgical excision of the cyst with Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Type I and IV cysts have a high risk of malignancy if left in place. (See <a href=\"#H1466497\" class=\"local\">'Type I and IV cysts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H67100188\" class=\"local\">'Cancer risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H61950961\" class=\"local\">'Patient follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with type II cysts, we suggest simple excision of the cyst rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2791467413\" class=\"local\">'Type II cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with type III cysts, we suggest treatment of symptomatic cysts as well as asymptomatic cysts in young patients, rather than treating all patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Sphincterotomy is often sufficient to relieve symptoms but should be accompanied by biopsy of the cyst epithelium to determine if the cyst is lined by duodenal or biliary mucosa (the latter being associated with an increased risk of malignancy), and to exclude dysplasia; alternatively, endoscopic or surgical resection may be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1466518\" class=\"local\">'Type III cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment for type V cysts is largely supportive and is aimed at dealing with problems such as recurrent cholangitis and sepsis. Type V cysts can be difficult to manage, and some patients with type V cysts eventually require liver transplantation.

Patients with an abnormal pancreatobiliary junction are at increased risk for gallbladder cancer.
