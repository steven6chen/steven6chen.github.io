These effusions result from the spread of inflammation and infection to the pleura. Much less commonly, infections in other areas adjacent to the pleura, such as the retropharyngeal, vertebral, abdominal, and retroperitoneal spaces, may spread to the pleura resulting in the development of effusion.</p><p>Early in the course of parapneumonic effusion, the pleura becomes inflamed; subsequent leakage of proteins, fluid, and leukocytes into the pleural space forms the effusion. At the time of formation, the pleural effusion is usually sterile with a low leukocyte count. With time, bacteria invade the fluid, resulting in empyema, which is defined as the presence of grossly purulent fluid in the pleural cavity. The development of pleural empyema is determined by a balance between host resistance, bacterial virulence, and timing of presentation for medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Early in the disease course, the effusion usually is free-flowing (also known as a &quot;simple&quot; effusion) and sterile. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loculated parapneumonic effusion</strong> refers to the presence of septations (separate compartments) within the effusion, which interfere with free flow of fluid. Loculation usually is detected by imaging (ultrasonography or computerized tomography [CT]). Loculation is caused by accumulation of proteinaceous debris in the fluid as the disease progresses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Empyema</strong> is defined as the presence of bacterial organisms on gram stain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> grossly purulent fluid in the pleural cavity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated parapneumonic effusion</strong> refers to changes in the pleural fluid due to bacterial invasion into the pleural space. Because bacteria are cleared rapidly after antibiotic therapy, cultures of fluid from complicated parapneumonic effusions are often negative. In clinical practice, the term is often used to refer to either loculated effusion or empyema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated pneumonia</strong> refers to pneumonia with any complication, including loculated parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or (more rarely) pneumothorax, necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both medical and surgical interventions have a role in the management of parapneumonic effusion in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The goals of therapy include sterilization of the pleural cavity, resolution of pleural fluid, and reexpansion of the lung. Selection of treatment depends upon factors including the patient's respiratory function and the size and loculation of the fluid collection, as well as the response to initial interventions. With appropriate treatment, outcomes are generally excellent. </p><p>Clinical experience and data from studies of parapneumonic effusion in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, because underlying lung disorders are more common in adults, and the morbidity and mortality of parapneumonic effusion in adults are higher than in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusions will require hospitalization for further management. Transfer to a facility with specialists in pediatric pulmonology, pediatric surgery, and pediatric anesthesia should be considered early in the care of children who may require video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Occasionally patients with small parapneumonic effusions who are clinically well and are responding to outpatient therapy can be managed without hospitalization, providing that they are followed closely to monitor progress. As for any patient with pneumonia, additional indications for hospitalization include ages younger than six months, evidence of bacteremia or respiratory compromise, and failure of outpatient management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;, section on 'Hospitalization'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parapneumonic effusion and empyema is a disease process that evolves over time, and different management strategies are appropriate at different stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In early stages, children tend to have small effusions and are in no respiratory distress; such patients usually can be managed as outpatients, with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and close observation with chest radiographs on an outpatient basis. (See <a href=\"#H242599471\" class=\"local\">'Small parapneumonic effusion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Later in the evolution of the process, the effusion may become larger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compromise respiratory function. Patients with these characteristics require hospitalization, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, ultrasound assessment, and drainage of pleural effusion (eg, via chest tube) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H242600537\" class=\"local\">'Moderate or large simple effusion (not loculated)'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequently, the effusion may become loculated or organized, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frankly infected (empyema). This stage usually requires more aggressive therapy, including fibrinolytic therapy or surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">debridement/drainage</span> of the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Expert opinion on the optimal type and timing of drainage and surgical intervention continues to evolve, and management remains somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H242600517\" class=\"local\">'Loculated effusion or empyema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Children with pneumonia-associated pleural disease can present initially with an effusion that is in any one of these stages of evolution. Management depends on the stage of evolution of the parapneumonic process and what therapy has already been provided. In some cases, oral antibiotics may have already been initiated in the outpatient setting before the effusion became apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242599713\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care for children with parapneumonic effusion may include antipyretics, analgesia, and early ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children with empyema are invariably febrile; antipyretics should be used for comfort as needed, with the caveat that their use may mask the resolution of fever, which is one of the indicators of clinical progress. Analgesia should be administered for pleuritic pain, which may interfere with breathing and affect the child's willingness to cough. Adequate analgesia will also help with early ambulation and other measures to encourage lung expansion. However, analgesia should be tailored to the patient's symptoms rather than regularly scheduled, to permit monitoring of clinical improvement. Sedatives and agents that may cause central respiratory depression should be used only if needed, and when needed should be used cautiously with close monitoring of respiratory status. </p><p>Children with parapneumonic effusions may become dehydrated as a result of poor intake and increased losses from fever and tachypnea. IV fluids should be administered if the child refuses oral intake or is unable to drink. However, close attention must be paid to fluid balance since these children also are at risk for developing syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bronchodilator therapy has no role in treatment of children with parapneumonic effusions and may potentially worsen their ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch, exacerbating hypoxemia.

In children with a small effusion, this may include broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and close observation on an outpatient basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Children with moderate to large effusions or empyema should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics in doses adequate to ensure pleural penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If drainage of pleural fluid is indicated, pleural fluid should be sent for culture and antibiotic sensitivity analysis, and testing for common organisms by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), if available. The culture should be performed prior to beginning antibiotics if this does not delay treatment. However, cultures can still be helpful even if the patient has been on antibiotics prior to the sampling of pleural fluid. (See <a href=\"#H242601411\" class=\"local\">'Placement'</a> below.) </p><p>The initial choice of antibiotic(s) should be empiric, informed by considerations of the most common organisms causing community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia in the patient's age group in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> community or hospital, respectively.

The choice of first-line antibiotics is mainly determined by the most common bacteriological etiology causing community-acquired pneumonia in a given area. Antibiotic selection is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56260 \">table 2</a>) and detailed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment#H96270984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;, section on 'Complicated CAP'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For ill-appearing children, it is particularly important to include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> in the regimen because of the increasing frequency of parapneumonic effusions caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Vancomycin remains the drug of choice to treat MRSA. However, other antibacterial agents, such as clindamycin, can be used if the organism is sensitive to them. The use of newer anti-MRSA antibiotics should be reserved for the most resistant cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-in-children-treatment-of-invasive-infections#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children: Treatment of invasive infections&quot;, section on 'Pneumonia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242602986\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospital-acquired infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic coverage for children with hospital-acquired (nosocomial) parapneumonic effusion should include coverage of gram-negative organisms.

Common practice is to continue antibiotics for at least 10 days after resolution of fever; antibiotics may be changed from the IV to oral route when the child has been afebrile and without a chest drain for two to five days, or possibly sooner if close clinical follow-up is assured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For community-acquired pneumonia associated with a parapneumonic effusion, oral antibiotics appear to be as effective as intravenous antibiotics after hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Moreover, oral antibiotics avoid potential complications that can be associated with intravenous catheters. For most cases of parapneumonic effusion or empyema, a total antibiotic course of two to four weeks is adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These approaches are similar, as summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76277\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76277 \">algorithm 2</a>): </p><p>Patients with simple effusions (free-flowing fluid) can be treated with drainage and antibiotics. In our practice, we insert a pigtail catheter (small bore catheter), which allows for continuous drainage. Continuous drainage (rather than antibiotics alone or simple thoracentesis) is particularly important if the patient has significant respiratory compromise or if the effusion is very large (eg, occupying more than one-half of the hemithorax), as determined by thoracic ultrasound (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chest tubes'</a> below). A fluid sample is sent for analysis and culture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology; clinical presentation; and evaluation of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children&quot;</a>); evaluation by PCR also may help to identify the organism, especially if antibiotics have already been initiated. The patient is treated intravenous (IV) antibiotics that are initially selected empirically, then adjusted based on PCR or culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who do not have a good clinical or radiologic response within 24 to 48 hours to management with antibiotics and chest tube drainage should advance to therapies used for loculated fluid or empyema. (See <a href=\"#H633131971\" class=\"local\">'Failure to respond'</a> below and <a href=\"#H242600517\" class=\"local\">'Loculated effusion or empyema'</a> below.). </p><p>As an alternative, a trial of antibiotics without drainage has been suggested for clinically stable patients with moderate pleural effusions, and occasionally in selected patients with large effusions. This approach was evaluated in a trial in children admitted with a moderate or even large pleural effusions and who are clinically well (admitted to the ward and not the intensive care unit (ICU), without requirement for supplemental oxygen, and without severe respiratory distress). These children were treated with a trial of empirically selected antibiotics for a 24 to 72 hour period without undergoing a drainage procedure; patients who did not respond clinically proceeded to chest tube placement or surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The underwater seal system is frequently used. This system is comprised of a tube placed underwater at a depth of approximately 1 to 2 cm, and a side vent, which either permits escape of air or is connected to a suction pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The system should be assessed daily for the amount of drainage, the presence of bubbling, and the presence of swing in the fluid with respiration (which confirms tube patency and appropriate position in the pleural cavity).</p><p>Very rapid drainage of fluid should be avoided. We suggest clamping the drain for one hour after drainage of the initial 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of pleural fluid. In large children and adolescents, some experts suggest that no more than 1500 mL of fluid should be drained at one time, and that drainage should be limited to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> although there is no specific evidence on which to base this suggestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. These precautions are suggested because very rapid drainage of pleural fluid occasionally causes pulmonary edema (known as &quot;reexpansion pulmonary edema&quot;). This complication has been reported after drainage of large effusions in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and in children with malignant lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but is otherwise rare in children. </p><p>Clamped drains must be immediately unclamped if there are any signs of clinical deterioration (eg, breathlessness, chest pain). This is because tension pneumothorax may develop in patients with air leak (which may be subclinical) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>A bubbling chest drain should never be clamped, for the same reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. Continuous bubbling from a chest drain suggests a continued visceral pleural air leak, which may develop into a tension pneumothorax if the chest drain is clamped. In chest tubes that are on suction, continuous bubbling may indicate that the drain is partly out of the thorax and one of the tube's drainage holes is open to the atmosphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Small soft drains are prone to kinking at the exit site, particularly in young mobile children. Obstruction of the tube by pus may be relieved by carefully flushing with normal saline (10 mL should be adequate in a small bore drain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The choice may be influenced by available expertise, cost considerations, and patient preferences. </p><p>Pleural drainage with fibrinolytics is successful in approximately 83 percent of children; the remaining 17 percent who fail medical therapy will require VATS, as shown in the following randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial in Europe compared VATS to medical therapy with fibrinolysis and found no difference in clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this trial, 60 children (&lt;16 years) with radiographic evidence of empyema and indications for drainage were randomly assigned to treatment with primary VATS or percutaneous chest tube drainage with intrapleural urokinase.

The median hospital stay after intervention was 6 days for both groups, with a range of 3 to 16 days for those treated with VATS and 4 to 25 days for those randomized to fibrinolysis. Hospital costs were 25 percent higher for the group treated with primary VATS versus those randomized to primary fibrinolysis. Of note, the fibrinolytic used in this trial was urokinase, which is less expensive than the fibrinolytic agents commonly used in the United States. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were shown in a randomized trial from the United States, in which 36 children were randomized to initial treatment with primary VATS or fibrinolysis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alteplase</a> (recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
