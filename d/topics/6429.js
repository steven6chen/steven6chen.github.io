The disparity in reported prevalence is due in part to the variably defined hematocrit thresholds used and the inclusion of transitory erythrocytosis (ie, persisting for less than six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Differences in immunosuppressive regimens may also contribute to disparities between centers in the reported prevalence of PTE since individual agents have variable effects on hemoglobin.</p><p>The incidence of PTE appears to be decreasing. Erythrocytosis defined as hemoglobin &gt;17 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> was reported in 19 percent of those transplanted between 1993 to 1996, but only 8 percent of those transplanted between 1997 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H719588705\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND ASSOCIATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential risk factors associated with posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) include male gender, a rejection-free course, and preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].

Renal artery stenosis of the native or transplanted kidney was suggested as a risk factor for PTE in early case reports, but this has not been confirmed in subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,22,23</a>].</p><p>PTE may be more common among recipients of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation.

Patients who received a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant had a higher incidence of PTE, compared with living, related renal transplant recipients (16 versus 3 percent, respectively).

Some patients appear to be particularly susceptible to PTE, suggesting that patient-specific risk factors play a role. As an example, in one report of a patient who underwent two transplants, PTE occurred after both surgeries, despite the presence of severe anemia in the intervening 12 months between transplantation of the first and second graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The following hormonal systems and growth factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PTE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythropoietin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins and serum-soluble stem cell factor (sSCF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renin-angiotensin system (RAS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous androgens</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2873640898\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased erythropoietin has been shown in many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/18,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,26</a>], though not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,26</a>], studies. As an example, in one study, serum erythropoietin concentrations were elevated in six of seven patients with PTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Even among PTE patients with serum erythropoietin concentrations within normal range, the concentration may be inappropriately elevated for a given hemoglobin. In one study, the mean <span class=\"nowrap\">observed/expected</span> serum erythropoietin ratio was elevated among 13 PTE patients compared with that of 42 renal transplant recipients without erythrocytosis (8.6 versus 0.3, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The demonstration of increased, or even normal, erythropoietin levels suggests that PTE may be a form of &quot;tertiary hypererythropoietinemia,&quot; in which mechanisms that suppress erythropoietin synthesis or secretion and are normally provoked by a normal or elevated hematocrit do not function adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].</p><p>The source of excess erythropoietin appears to be the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. This was suggested by one detailed study of three patients that demonstrated higher blood erythropoietin titers obtained by selective catheterization from the renal veins of native kidneys versus transplanted kidneys (41 versus 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL,</span> respectively). In one patient, erythropoietin titers and hematocrit were decreased within two weeks of bilateral native nephrectomy.</p><p>With the exception of phlebotomy, therapies that correct PTE are generally accompanied by a reduction in erythropoietin levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> normalization of the erythropoietin versus hematocrit relationship. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H223341273\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic factors, including IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, and the sSCF, may either enhance the sensitivity to erythropoietin or directly promote erythropoiesis in patients with PTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27-29</a>]. In one study, cultured erythroid progenitors from patients with PTE were shown to have increased sensitivity to erythropoietin in vitro compared with erythroid progenitors from transplant recipients with normal hematocrits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Increased concentrations of plasma IGF-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its major binding proteins have been demonstrated in patients with PTE compared with transplant recipients with normal hematocrits. In one series of 40 PTE patients, treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor reduced concentrations of both erythropoietin and IGF-1 from 15.4&plusmn;6.2 to 11.2&plusmn;6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL</span> and from 364&plusmn;99 to 280&plusmn;129 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms underlying increased IGF-1 concentrations are unknown.</p><p>sSCF, which stimulates the growth of erythroid progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], has been shown to correlate with both hematocrit values and with the <span class=\"nowrap\">observed/expected</span> erythropoietin values in PTE patients, suggesting a possible role in pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3784133997\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation of renin-angiotensin system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the RAS and especially angiotensin II, its active octapeptide, may contribute to PTE by acting as a direct growth factor on erythroid progenitors and stimulating erythropoietin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In this regard, activation of the angiotensin II receptor in PTE patients may enhance erythropoietin production in the graft or the native kidneys and directly activate red cell precursors in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,32,34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,32,34-40</a>]. In addition, angiotensin II may induce hypoxia-inducible factor, a transcription factor that promotes the production of erythropoietin, and augment iron metabolism through alterations of iron transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. However, in a study with 331 consecutive transplant recipients, there was no association of polymorphic variants of the ACE, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II receptor type 1 genes with PTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, experimental observations in genetically manipulated animals suggest an interrelationship between RAS activation and augmented erythropoiesis. In mice that carry both the human renin and angiotensinogen genes, development of hypertension is accompanied by higher hematocrit values, increased serum erythropoietin levels, and enhanced expression of erythropoietin messenger RNA. Both blood pressure and hematocrit remain normal when the two transgenes are introduced into the angiotensin II receptor null background, an observation that highlights the pivotal role of this receptor in both mediating sustained hypertension and regulating erythropoiesis. In contrast, in angiotensinogen, ACE, and angiotensin II receptor knock-out animals, lowering of blood pressure is coupled by decreased hematocrit values. In angiotensinogen and renin knock-out animals, anemia is rescued by angiotensin II infusion, an effect that is completely blocked by simultaneous administration of angiotensin II receptor blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/37,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,45</a>].</p><p>Similarly, a host of clinical data indirectly support the role of the RAS system in erythropoiesis. As an example, erythrocytosis has been reported in patients with renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cell tumors and in patients with Bartter syndrome, a condition characterized by hyperreninemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. By contrast, RAS inactivation by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibits erythropoiesis in most patients, although it does not cause clinically significant anemia in the vast majority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may inhibit erythropoiesis in renal transplant recipients and nontransplant cohorts. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Enalapril</a> was associated with anemia in renal transplant recipients with high-normal hematocrit at baseline, but not in those with lower baseline hematocrits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Cochrane meta-analysis that included 332 renal transplant recipients, ACE inhibitors, compared with calcium channel blockers, were associated with a 12.96-point lower hemoglobin concentration (95% CI 15.7-10.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Enalapril</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> decreased hematocrits in nontransplanted individuals who have secondary polycythemia due to high-altitude or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Enalapril</a> decreased hemoglobin levels without affecting plasma volume and increased the odds for anemia by approximately 50 percent in cardiac patients with low ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors or ARBs may increase erythropoietin requirements in patients treated with maintenance dialysis, whereas their withdrawal allows decreases in erythropoietin doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p>The mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhibit erythropoiesis are incompletely defined, and some effects may not be common to both classes of drugs. As an example, ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, cause an increase in the protein, Ac-SDKP (goralatide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/35-37,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37,56</a>]. Goralatide inhibits pluripotent stem cell entry into S phase and is usually metabolized by ACE, thereby diminishing erythropoiesis. However, this mechanism does not explain the effectiveness of ARBs in correcting PTE, suggesting that other mechanisms are also operative.</p><p>Some studies have shown that, among PTE patients with normal or high erythropoietin concentrations, the ACE inhibitor-induced reduction in hematocrit is associated with a fall in plasma erythropoietin concentrations, suggesting an erythropoietin-dependent mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/7,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,57</a>]. However, ACE inhibitors are also effective among patients whose erythropoietin concentrations are initially suppressed or which do not fall significantly after therapy is begun, suggesting that these agents may also act via an erythropoietin-independent mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,7,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,58</a>]. Also compatible with an erythropoietin-independent mechanism is the observation that withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor in patients with PTE results in a gradual rise in hematocrit without a concurrent elevation in erythropoietin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2662106967\"><span class=\"h2\">Endogenous androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endogenous androgens may play a role in the development of PTE. Male sex is one of the most important risk factors for the development of PTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Androgens directly stimulate erythroid progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] and indirectly promote erythropoiesis by stimulating either endogenous erythropoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] or the RAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>One study sought to determine whether angiogenic factors contribute to PTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured in 13 patients with PTE, 75 untreated erythrocytosis nontransplant patients, and 21 healthy controls. The results indicated that VEGF was overproduced in advanced and untreated polycythemia vera (PV) patients and to a lesser degree in idiopathic erythrocytosis, but there was no evidence of increased VEGF in PTE and in secondary erythrocytosis. The absence of angiogenesis in PTE and its presence in PV demonstrates that the pathogenesis of these two entities is different. This might explain the relatively benign course of PTE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H719588281\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttransplant erythrocytosis (PTE) usually occurs 8 to 24 months after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the absence of treatment, PTE spontaneously remits in one-fourth of patients within two years from onset. In the remainder of patients, PTE persists for a number of years, after which it may remit in association with deteriorating renal function due to chronic rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrocytosis-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/15,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25</a>].</p><p>As in other forms of erythrocytosis, approximately 60 percent of patients with PTE experience malaise, headache, plethora, lethargy, and dizziness; 10 to 30 percent develop thromboembolic events; and 1 to 2 percent eventually die of associated complications if untreated and if erythrocytosis does not spontaneously remit.
