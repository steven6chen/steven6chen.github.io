Young children usually swallow their sputum; as a result, hemoptysis is rare in children unless the bleeding is substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264008784\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoptysis refers to expectoration of blood originating from the lower respiratory tract. Blood from the upper respiratory tract, nasopharynx, and upper gastrointestinal tract can be expectorated and can mimic true hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"#H264009285\" class=\"local\">'Mimics of hemoptysis'</a> below.) </p><p>There is no consensus for quantifying the degree of hemoptysis. In adults, a common threshold for defining massive hemoptysis is expectoration of &ge;500 mL over a 24-hour period, or bleeding at a rate of &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a consensus panel classified hemoptysis as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scant &ndash; less than 5 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild to moderate &ndash; 6 to 240 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive &ndash; more than 240 mL</p><p/><p>However, such estimates are often imprecise, and these categories do not account for the size of the patient. Moreover, an estimate of the volume of bleeding does not consistently predict the cause or outcome of bleeding in CF or other diseases. Thus, management depends on individual patient characteristics and clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lung contains two separate blood supplies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulmonary arterial circulation is a high volume, low pressure system, in which maximal pulmonary artery pressure normally does not exceed 40 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Its branches accompany the bronchi down to the level of the terminal bronchioles. Ultimately, pulmonary vessels branch to supply the capillary bed in the walls of the alveoli and then return to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchial circulation carries a much smaller volume of oxygenated blood, an estimated 1 percent of the cardiac output in a normal individual at rest, but does so at higher systemic pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Usually, the patient has three recognizable bronchial arteries, two that supply the left lung and one that supplies the right, although 20 to 30 percent of individuals have two vessels on each side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These arteries typically originate from the aorta or the intercostal arteries and perfuse conducting airways approximately to the level of the terminal bronchioles. More distally, the airway structures are nourished by the pulmonary artery circulation.</p><p/><p>Bleeding can arise from either system. Bleeding usually is slower or more insidious when it arises from the pulmonary circulation (eg, in the presence of left-sided cardiac disease) because of the lower pressure. Bleeding is more likely to be substantial when it arises from the bronchial circulation because of the higher hydrostatic pressures promoting hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of hemoptysis in children are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62214\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62214 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. In children, respiratory infection, aspirated foreign bodies, and bronchiectasis are the most common etiologies, and among those with bronchiectasis, most have cystic fibrosis (CF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway diseases</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchiectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with CF, chronic airway infection and inflammation damages the airway, stimulates neovascularization, and promotes growth of dilated and fragile bronchial arteries. These vessels lie close to the inflamed mucosal surface, increasing the risk of bleeding with cough or further infection. This mechanism probably applies to non-CF bronchiectasis as well, though this has not been evaluated rigorously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>CF-associated bronchiectasis is a common cause of hemoptysis in children and adolescents. In a series of 228 patients admitted to a tertiary center with hemoptysis, 65 percent had CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Children and young adults with CF frequently experience small-volume hemoptysis with blood-streaked sputum, particularly during pulmonary exacerbations. Over time, up to 60 percent of patients older than 18 years of age with CF have blood-streaked sputum in intermittent episodes, and 4.1 percent will suffer massive hemoptysis during their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this population, coagulopathy secondary to vitamin K deficiency caused by fat malabsorption may exacerbate hemoptysis. In the CF patient, esophageal varices due to hepatic cirrhosis are also important causes of bleeding, which can mimic hemoptysis. Patients with bronchiectasis attributable to causes other than CF have an incidence of hemoptysis of approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In a substantial majority of cases, the aspiration is not initially recognized within the first 24 hours of the event and the child may present days or weeks after the aspiration event with wheezing (usually monophonic and perhaps unilateral), chronic cough, pneumonia, or hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A history of choking is highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration, but the event may not be recalled at the time of presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8221307\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with an acute respiratory infection, forceful cough can cause mechanical trauma to the airway and result in minor hemoptysis, characterized by blood-streaked sputum. This type of hemoptysis is usually benign and self-limited. </p><p>In children with endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes, deep suctioning can lead to mucosal injury of central airways, resulting in bloody sputum. In about 10 percent of such children, the bleeding is more than scant; bronchoscopy findings in such cases include mucosal abrasions or granulation tissue. Use of humidification, soft suction catheters, and suction to a measured length may help prevent bleeding or allow the injured mucosa to heal. Massive hemoptysis can occur in the rare instance of an airway tube eroding into a large vessel in the mediastinum or tracheal wall. The risk of erosion is greatly increased with the use of cuffed endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary parenchymal diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of bleeding originating from the pulmonary parenchyma fall into several major categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Hemoptysis can be caused by any pneumonia or lung abscess but is especially associated with tuberculosis or aspergilloma. Acute infection with endemic mycoses can produce massive hemoptysis in otherwise healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

It typically presents with recurrent dyspnea, cough, and anemia. Hemoptysis usually develops later, but occasionally is a presenting symptom. It is characterized by hemosiderin laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid without evidence of capillaritis or other cause of bleeding on lung biopsy.

Initial reports from a cluster in Cleveland suggested a possible association between AIPH and exposure to <em>Stachybotrys chartarum</em> (also known as <em>Stachybotrys atra</em>) toxin, a black mold found in damp ceilings and basements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

In some reported cases, the infants required mechanical ventilation but recovered completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A separate report suggests that von Willebrand disease caused or contributed to pulmonary hemorrhage in several cases that were initially diagnosed as AIPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &ndash; Miscellaneous causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage include bone marrow transplant (presenting with hemoptysis during the first months after transplant), pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and catamenial hemoptysis (recurrent hemoptysis that coincides with menses, due to intrathoracic endometriosis). An association between celiac disease and pulmonary hemosiderosis has been termed &quot;Lane Hamilton syndrome,&quot; and appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, hemoptysis is related to a specific exposure, including medications (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propylthiouracil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">penicillamine</a>), or inhalation (nitrogen dioxide, pesticides, marijuana, or cocaine).

This complication is rare because Swan-Ganz catheters are now used infrequently. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital heart disease</strong> &ndash; Hemoptysis is a known complication in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). This symptom may account for up to 4.5 percent of cases of CHD presenting to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a report from a pediatric tertiary care center, CHD was responsible for 25 percent of cases of hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Underlying defects that lead to hemoptysis include pulmonary venous obstructive disease, pulmonary hypertension (specifically post-capillary hypertension), and left-sided cardiac obstructive lesions such as mitral stenosis and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Other cardiac-related causes of hemoptysis include congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema, which may present with pink, frothy sputum.

Bleeding from the upper respiratory tract, nasopharynx, or upper gastrointestinal tract can mimic true hemoptysis. As an example, cystic fibrosis (CF) predisposes to both hemoptysis (due to bronchiectasis) and bleeding from esophageal varices (due to cirrhosis), and the bleeding source is not always apparent (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Bronchiectasis'</a> above). The history and physical examination should investigate these possible sources of bleeding. In some patients, investigations such as gastrointestinal endoscopy or nasopharyngeal fiberoptic endoscopy may be needed to exclude gastrointestinal or nasopharyngeal sources of bleeding. </p><p>Factitious hemoptysis, where children have inflicted injuries mimicking pulmonary bleeding, has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Munchausen syndrome (or Munchausen syndrome by proxy) should be considered in a patient who presents with hemoptysis, unusual symptoms, and a negative evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In these patients, evaluation for the cause of the hemoptysis occurs simultaneously, or as a second step after stabilization.

Mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may improve oxygenation and tamponade the site of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Selective intubation to the unaffected lung may help decrease the risk of asphyxiation and assist in ventilation. When the site of bleeding is unknown, double-lumen tubes should be used, if available for the child's size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. For the cystic fibrosis (CF) patient with massive hemoptysis, Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) should be discontinued due to the risk of further aspiration of blood and the potential need for a more stable airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For this reason, BiPAP is also not recommended for non-CF hemoptysis. </p><p>Cough should be minimized by opiates in order to prevent worsening of hemoptysis. If the hemithorax in which the bleeding originates can be identified (either by chest radiograph or physical findings), the patient should lie with the bleeding side down in order to prevent blood from filling the unaffected lung. Chest physiotherapy and medications that may affect clotting should be stopped, including non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87172681\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If bleeding does not stop with these measures, bronchoscopy usually is the next step to evaluate and control active bleeding. For patients with CF and massive hemoptysis who are clinically unstable, a consensus panel suggests proceeding directly to bronchial artery embolization (BAE), rather than performing bronchoscopy for evaluative purposes prior to BAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This does not preclude performing bronchoscopy for therapeutic purposes in CF patients, if the clinicians judge that this would be valuable for the individual patient. Similarly, proceeding directly to BAE is appropriate for some patients without CF, if the source of the bleeding is known or localized by radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6035332\" class=\"local\">'Bronchial artery embolization'</a> below.) </p><p>No clear consensus exists as to whether rigid or flexible bronchoscopy (also called fiberoptic bronchoscopy) is preferable. The information gained from these techniques is complementary, and the procedures may be performed sequentially under the same sedation. </p><p>Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred by some clinicians in cases of ongoing profuse bleeding because it allows airway control and more rapid suctioning of large volumes of clots and debris. The larger lumen also permits interventions to provide tamponade. However, this technique must be performed using general anesthesia, and generally it is performed by a surgeon in an operating room, so the patient may need to be moved. The visual range of rigid bronchoscopy is limited to the major bronchi. </p><p>Flexible bronchoscopy also can be used to control bleeding.

For such patients, a focused history, physical examination, and chest radiograph usually are sufficient to determine whether the hemoptysis is consistent with a benign cause (eg, bronchitis with forceful coughing, or trauma from deep suctioning). In such cases, the hemoptysis tends to resolve spontaneously and is unlikely to recur. No further intervention is necessary other than observation for recurrence and appearance of other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8221307\" class=\"local\">'Airway trauma'</a> above.) </p><p>Particular attention should be paid to clinical characteristics that suggest the possibility of foreign body aspiration, especially in young children or those with swallowing dysfunction. These include a history of choking (days to weeks prior to hemoptysis, even if transient) and new respiratory symptoms such as wheezing. Children with foreign body aspiration may or may not have an abnormal chest radiograph and fever. If foreign body aspiration is suspected, bronchoscopy should be performed for diagnosis and removal. (See <a href=\"#H8221348\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with CF and mild or moderate hemoptysis (&ge;5 mL blood), consensus guidelines specifically recommend stopping non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs) and treating with systemic antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97388 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemoptysis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Other conclusions of the consensus panel are summarized in the table.

These efforts also should attempt to localize the bleeding source to either the gastrointestinal tract or the upper or lower respiratory tract, based on the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood from a pulmonary source (true hemoptysis) usually is bright red or rust colored, and it can be frothy and mixed with sputum. The pH usually is alkaline. Symptoms include coughing or a gurgling noise perceived by the patient. Older children may report discomfort in one hemithorax that may help localize the bleeding site. Frothy sputum suggests an alveolar source of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, blood from a gastric source (hematemesis), usually is crimson or brown with a coffee-ground appearance and may contain food particles. The pH is acidic, and nausea or retching may precede the episode. </p><p/><p>These characteristics are helpful, but they are not reliable indicators of the source of the bleeding. If gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected, this possibility should be further explored through an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This includes patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or other causes of liver disease, who are at risk for portal hypertension and bleeding from esophageal varices. In all patients, the possibility of nasopharyngeal bleeding should be explored by a careful inspection during the physical examination, with nasopharyngeal fiberoptic endoscopy if needed.
