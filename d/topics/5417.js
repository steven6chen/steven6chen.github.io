Other methods to anesthetize locally the tissues of the digits vary from applications of topical agents to subcutaneous injections of anesthetic solutions. Due to the extreme sensitivity of the palmar surfaces of the digits, a local injection may be painful and ineffective at anesthetizing the tissues. The injection sites for the digital nerve block are typically less painful; furthermore, they provide a larger area of consistent anesthesia throughout the operative region.</p><p>The performance of digital nerve blocks is reviewed here. Specific anesthetics, peripheral nerve blocks of larger nerves, and the management of specific conditions such as nail bed injuries are discussed separately.

In order to achieve a complete anesthetic effect, it is necessary to block all four nerves. The digital nerves of the fingers arise from either the median or ulnar nerves and divide in the palm into palmar (or volar) branches. These nerves are accompanied by digital blood vessels as they run on both sides of the flexor tendon sheath to innervate each finger. The palmar nerves dominate by innervating all of the finger and the nail bed except for the dorsum of the finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52343 \">figure 1</a>), which is innervated by the dorsal digital nerves that run along the dorsolateral aspect of each finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52608%7EPC%2F50552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52608 graphicRef50552 \">figure 2A-B</a>). The digital nerves of the toes run on both sides of each toe and represent the terminal branches of the tibial and peroneal nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82236%7EPC%2F52461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82236 graphicRef52461 \">figure 3A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Hand and foot anatomy are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults#H406361780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic foot anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC AGENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The types and use of local anesthetic agents is reviewed separately. Selected issues relevant to digital nerve blocks are discussed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Most local anesthetics are classified as amides or esters. These pharmacologic agents act by inhibiting nerve impulses. Commonly used preparations include the amide class agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (Xylocaine) and the ester class agent procaine (Novocain) in concentrations of 1 or 2 percent. Use of higher concentrations can reduce the total volume of fluid injected, which may reduce discomfort and complications from tissue compression. Onset of anesthesia with a digital block typically occurs in about five minutes, but full anesthetic effect takes longer (10 to 15 minutes). Individual variation is to be expected.</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or procaine may last only 30 to 40 minutes, but anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> (Marcaine) 0.25 percent typically lasts several hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The duration of effect of all agents is longer if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is added, but bupivacaine remains longer-acting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bupivacaine has been used in combination with shorter-acting agents in patients where prolonged anesthesia is required to try to achieve rapid onset of anesthesia with a prolonged effect, but this is probably not necessary; one small randomized trial found that bupivacaine alone had a similar onset of action to that of lidocaine plus bupivacaine (mean time to anesthesia 5.35 versus 5 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Before choosing an agent, check to see that the patient does not have any allergies to the preparation to be used. Allergies to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> are rare, but they do occur. Treat allergic reactions aggressively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to local anesthetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some local anesthetics are combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in commercially available solutions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> hydrochloride 1 percent with epinephrine 1:100,000). Epinephrine causes local vasoconstriction, thereby reducing bleeding, and maintains the anesthetic in the tissues for a longer period of time. However, the digital arteries run in close proximity to the digital nerves and injecting epinephrine into the base of a digit causes vasoconstriction of these vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which may increase the risk of digital ischemia in susceptible individuals. </p><p>Controlled studies of the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In most cases, the use of epinephrine for digital blocks appears to be effective and safe when used for short procedures, such as treating ingrown nails (paronychia), repairing a skin laceration, removing a nail, or performing a skin or nail biopsy. In patients at increased risk for digital ischemia or infarction, such as those with peripheral vascular disease, it is best to avoid epinephrine.</p><p>Comprehensive reviews of the medical literature and large observational studies, including studies of both low (1:100,00) and high (1:1,000) concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, have failed to find any reports of gangrene or major ischemic complications solely attributable to lidocaine with epinephrine or with the use of commercial <span class=\"nowrap\">lidocaine/epinephrine</span> preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/7-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-17</a>]. Gangrene had occurred in 1948, prior to the introduction of such commercial preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In addition, a Doppler study of 24 patients treated with digital blocks containing epinephrine found that the drug's vasoconstrictive effects resolve within 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These studies support the safety of appropriately used epinephrine with lidocaine, which leads to faster onset and longer duration of anesthesia without negative vascular sequela when used in digital blocks. </p><p>One alternative to using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to control bleeding when performing a digital block is to place a small Penrose drain clamped around the base of the digit during the procedure. This method is used for short procedures; prolonged digit ischemia (over 60 minutes) must be avoided. Be certain to remove the drain once the procedure is completed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain with administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of anesthetics can be painful. Techniques for reducing such pain are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics#H540550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;, section on 'Methods to decrease injection pain'</a>.)</p><p>A number of measures have been recommended to reduce the pain of anesthesia although data on efficacy are somewhat limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buffering the solution with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using small needles (27 or 30 gauge)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injecting slowly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injecting subcutaneously instead of intradermally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warming the anesthetic to body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p>The standard solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> has a pH of 5.0 to 7.0. It can be buffered to a pH of 7.0 to 7.2 by adding one part of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mL</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> to 9 or 10 parts of 1 percent lidocaine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>EMLA topical cream (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a>)</span> has been used to decrease the pain caused by the initial injection of the anesthetic agent. The effectiveness of such agents for decreasing the pain of a digital block is uncertain, as two studies in patients with ingrown toenails produced conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The reason for these differing results is unclear. For EMLA to provide effective albeit superficial anesthesia, it must be applied for one hour prior to injection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Informed consent is always advisable when pursuing a procedure, regardless of how minor. Explain the benefits and risks of the procedure, and make sure that the patient understands the issues. Common risks for digital blocks include infection and bleeding. There is also the risk of distal paresthesia, if the nerve is damaged, and the possibility of distal infarct from vasospasm. However, these risks are small and can be avoided with careful attention to technique. Prior to proceeding with the block, perform a neurologic exam to detect sensory abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gather all the materials necessary to perform the procedure and place them within easy reach. Prepare all supplies in a sterile fashion. For some procedures (eg, removal of in-grown nails, wart treatment), a clean field, rather than sterile technique, may be sufficient. Prepare the anesthetic vial with alcohol prior to drawing up the solution. Usual materials needed for the digital block are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 3-mL syringe with an 18 to 22 gauge needle for drawing up anesthetic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic, buffered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> if possible. Digital block is usually achieved with 2 to 3 mL of the anesthetic solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 27 to 30 gauge needle for performing the anesthetic injection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prepare the skin with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> solution to decrease the risk of infection. Perform three separate scrubbings with the antibacterial solution to include both the injured area and the injection sites. The ideal technique is to begin at the area of attention and scrub outwards in a circular fashion. This may be difficult with toes, and an alternative is to soak the digit for five minutes in the antibacterial solution. We suggest soaking rather than scrubbing for inflamed, painful digits, such as those with an ingrown nail or paronychia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIGITAL BLOCK PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performing a digital block is relatively straightforward but requires attention to specific precautions. The basic approach is the same for both toes and fingers. Various techniques have been described for anesthetizing the digits. These include the traditional four-sided &quot;ring block,&quot; the three-sided digital block, the finger web space block, the transthecal block, and the subcutaneous block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the technique chosen, advance and inject slowly to minimize pain being caused by distension of the tissues from infiltration of the fluid. Avoid using more than 3 to 4 mL of anesthetic solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a small gauge needle; 27 to 30 gauge is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before injecting the solution, slowly retract on the plunger of the syringe to avoid injecting into one of the digital blood vessels that accompany the digital nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the procedure is somewhat uncomfortable, it should not cause undue pain. Excessive pain or paresthesias suggests that the needle is against or in a nerve. Withdraw 2 mm and reinject; the goal is to bathe the surrounding tissue and nerve with anesthetic, rather than injecting directly into the nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can take 10 to 15 minutes for the anesthetic to take complete effect. Therefore, it is recommended to wait for at least 10 minutes after injection to ensure that an adequate block will be achieved. If sensation is present after 10 minutes, wait an additional five minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for anesthesia by pinching the tissues with forceps or with a needle prick. Begin testing with areas most likely to be numb (ie, proximal tissue). Always test the area to be operated upon. For nail removal, test the tip, the proximal and lateral nail folds, and the nail bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The techniques below describe bilateral blocks to achieve complete anesthesia. If anesthesia is only required on one side of a digit, the block may be limited to that side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If sensation persists at the nail tip despite adequate injection, a wing block can be used. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Wing block procedure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Fingers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Finger web space block (traditional digital block)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique is performed as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the area has been prepped (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Skin preparation'</a> above), place the patient's hand flat and palm-side down on a sterile drape.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the syringe perpendicular to the finger and insert the needle into the subcutaneous tissue of the web space at the base of the finger, just distal to the MCP <span class=\"nowrap\">(metacarpal/phalangeal)</span> joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50533 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject the anesthetic into the subcutaneous dorsal tissue, and infiltrate the tissues surrounding the dorsal nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowly advance the needle straight through the web space toward the palmar surface, injecting as the needle is advanced, and infiltrating the tissues surrounding the palmar nerve. Avoid pushing the needle through the palmar skin surface. One to 1.5 mL of anesthetic should be sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdraw the needle completely and repeat the procedure on the opposite side of the finger.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Transthecal block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transthecal block (or flexor tendon sheath digital block) is performed by infusing the flexor tendon sheath with an anesthetic solution through a single injection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locate the flexor tendon by palpating at the level of the distal palmar crease. Flexing the digit can help to identify the tendon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the area has been prepped (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Skin preparation'</a> above), place the patient's hand flat and palm-side up on a sterile drape.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a 25-gauge needle, hold the syringe at a 45 degree angle and pierce the skin surface just distal to the distal palmar crease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51880\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51880 \">picture 2</a>). Advance the needle into the flexor tendon sheath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once in the sheath, slowly inject 1 to 2 mL of anesthetic solution (1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, buffered if possible). The solution should flow freely into the synovial space between the tendon and sheath. If resistance is met, it is likely that the needle tip is against the tendon. Withdraw slightly, until the injection proceeds smoothly. Distend the sheath slightly with the anesthetic solution so that the medication diffuses throughout the synovial sheath.</p><p/><p>An alternative method can be used to ensure that the needle is in the tendon sheath:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert a 25-gauge needle (not attached to a syringe) into the flexor tendon sheath in the same manner as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the needle placement by having the patient flex and extend the finger.

The authors of one small observational study suggest that the transthecal block works via subcutaneous administration of anaesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There is a theoretical risk of flexor tendon injury from the transthecal approach, although this is unlikely.

The three-sided block is preferred to avoid the potential ischemic risk from the ring block.</p><p>According to one small randomized trial, pain can be reduced when performing a block of the great toe by using a 2-stage injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This approach involves injecting a small amount (about 0.2 mL) of anaesthetic solution along the standard injection track adjacent to the toe, waiting two minutes, and then reinserting the needle into the same site and injecting the remainder of the solution (about 0.8 mL).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Three-sided toe block</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the area has been prepped (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Skin preparation'</a> above), place the patient's foot flat and plantar-side down on a sterile drape.

One to 1.5 mL of anesthetic should be sufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdraw the needle completely and repeat the procedure on the opposite side of the toe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20686097\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral digital block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingrown nails sometimes occur on only one side of a toe or finger. In such cases, a unilateral digital block may be used to provide anaesthesia for removal of the affected nail segment. This involves injecting anesthetic either at the base of the digit or at the area between phalanges on either the medial or lateral side. To perform the procedure, insert the needle midway between the dorsal and volar surfaces of the digit perpendicular to the skin, pointing directly toward the phalanx. The needle tip should be near the bone (if you touch the bone, withdraw the needle 1 or 2 mm). Then inject 0.5 mL of anesthetic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Wing block procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative procedure for achieving anesthesia of a distal digit (as might be needed for nail surgery) is to perform a wing block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A wing block is technically relatively simple and may achieve more rapid anesthesia than a digital block. It can be used for fingers or toes and, if anesthesia is only needed on one side of a digit (as for a partial nail removal), can be performed unilaterally.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the area has been prepped (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Skin preparation'</a> above), place the patient's finger or toe flat and volar-side down on a sterile drape or stabilize the digit with the other hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding the syringe at a 45 degree angle to the plane of the table and perpendicular to the long axis of the digit, insert the needle a short distance to enter the deep intradermal tissue of the dorsum of the digit at a point approximately 3 mm proximal to an imaginary point where a linear extension of the lateral and proximal nail folds would intersect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74358\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74358 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject the anesthetic into the intradermal tissue, first infiltrating the proximal nail fold; the needle can be advanced to allow infiltration along the proximal nail fold. The needle is then partially withdrawn and redirected to allow infiltration of the intradermal tissue along the lateral nail fold. As the anesthetic is injected, the folds blanch and distend creating a wing-like appearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When bilateral anesthesia is desired, anesthetic must be infiltrated similarly on the opposite lateral nail fold and along the entire proximal nail fold. For small digits, it may be possible to achieve this by advancing the needle without requiring a second skin puncture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If sensation persists at the nail tip, additional anesthetic may be injected into the dermis of the sensate skin using a 30 gauge needle. Anesthesia should be almost immediate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several safe and equally effective techniques are available to achieve a digital block. These are described in detail in the text. The least invasive technique that the clinician is comfortable with should be chosen. Regardless of the technique, pay careful attention to details such as using aseptic techniques and minimizing the volume of anesthetic that is injected. Check the adequacy of anesthesia before starting any procedure and administer additional anesthetic directly into sensate skin when necessary.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, 14th ed, Agur A, Dalley A (Eds), Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia 2017.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digital-nerve-block/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thomson CJ, Lalonde DH.
