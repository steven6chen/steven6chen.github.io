Some women have symptoms from the male hormones the tumor makes. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having fewer monthly periods or no periods at all</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of breast tissue, which can make the breasts smaller</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair growth in places where only men tend to grow hair, such as the face, chest, and back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voice changes, making the voice sound deeper</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing hair from the head (like men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the size of the clitoris (a part of the genitals)</p><p/><p>Other women have symptoms as the tumor grows bigger.

This will happen during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279462890\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. The type of surgery done depends partly on your age and whether you plan to have more children.</p><p>Women who are older or done having children usually have surgery to remove their ovaries, uterus, and the tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes). This surgery is called a &quot;hysterectomy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57901 \">figure 2</a>). It's important to know that after a woman's uterus is removed, she cannot get pregnant. Also, women who have both ovaries removed sometimes need to take hormone pills.</p><p>Women who might want more children or who don't want to take hormone pills usually have surgery to remove only the ovary with the tumor.</p><p>Other treatment depends on the type of tumor you have and whether the tumor cells spread to another part of your body. If the cells did not spread, you probably won't need any other treatment.</p><p>But if the tumor cells spread to another part of your body, you will need treatment with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279462922\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor can involve making choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279462937\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirsutism-excess-hair-growth-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hirsutism (excess hair growth in women) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acne (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirsutism-excess-hair-growth-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hirsutism (excess hair growth in women) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acne (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
