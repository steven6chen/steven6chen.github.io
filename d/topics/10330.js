This diagnosis can be easily overlooked among patients with acute chest pain, and a high index of suspicion is needed to obtain a timely diagnosis such that appropriate initial therapy can be instituted promptly. Advances in imaging and better awareness have improved the diagnosis, which is confirmed using advanced cardiovascular imaging. </p><p>The DeBakey and the Stanford (Daily) systems are used to classify aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The Stanford system, which is more widely used, classifies dissections that involve the ascending aorta as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear; all other dissections are classified as type B. </p><p>The goals of early management of aortic dissection are to control pain and limit the extension of the dissection using anti-impulse therapy, which typically involves administration of beta blockers and control of blood pressure. Timing of intervention differs for ascending (type A) and descending (type B) thoracic aortic dissection, and thus, early determination of the extent of dissection is important. </p><p>The management of acute aortic dissection will be reviewed here. The recommendations are generally in agreement with multidisciplinary cardiovascular guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Acute type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency. Acute type B aortic dissection typically does not require urgent surgery unless the patient develops complications (eg, end-organ malperfusion, refractory pain, rapidly expanding false lumen, impending or frank rupture). Acute medical therapies should not interfere with timely transfer to the operating room for those in whom immediate surgery is indicated. An experienced cardiovascular surgeon should be involved early in the course to discuss any decision for surgery and its timing, which must be individualized, taking into account the patient's comorbidities (eg, prior stroke, renal failure, hypertension, coronary heart disease), age, and patient and family wishes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection#H534617607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular management of type B aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Indications for intervention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1300651537\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent and classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is confirmed and the extent of the dissection is determined using advanced cardiovascular imaging. Diagnostic evaluation should be accomplished as promptly as possible. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable, bedside transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used with high sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In stable patients, computed tomographic (CT) angiography is more frequently chosen for the reasons discussed elsewhere.

By comparison, the DeBakey system is based on the site of origin with type I originating in the ascending aorta and propagating to at least the aortic arch, type II originating in and confined to the ascending aorta, and type III originating in the descending aorta and extending distally or proximally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes#H1708752646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute aortic dissection and other acute aortic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3449329237\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of the dissection also has a bearing on management and, in particular, the nature of aortic repair, when indicated, for descending thoracic aortic dissection. In general, patients with idiopathic (sporadic) descending thoracic and abdominal aortic dissection can be managed with endovascular techniques, whereas an open surgical approach is preferred for those with genetically mediated dissection due to the likelihood of further aortic degeneration.

Even in patients with malperfusion syndromes, survival is better with surgical intervention, although prognosis is significantly worse when these risk factors are present. Hemorrhagic stroke is a relative contraindication to urgent surgical intervention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600299499\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative mortality for acute type A aortic dissection at experienced centers ranges from 7 to 36 percent, which is well below the more than 50 percent mortality with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/8-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2070453640\" class=\"local\">'Extent of open repair'</a> below.)</p><p>The survival benefits of surgery were illustrated in an International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) review of 547 patients with a type A dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Eighty percent of patients were treated surgically. The main cited reasons for medical therapy were comorbid conditions, advanced age (mean of 80 years), and patient refusal. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27 and 56 percent for surgical and medical therapy, respectively, which is a difference that was due in part to increased comorbidity in medically treated patients. Not surprisingly, the patients who died had a higher rate of in-hospital complications, including neurologic deficits, coronary or mesenteric ischemia, acute renal failure, and limb ischemia. In a separate series of 487 patients, a similar in-hospital mortality with surgical therapy (22 percent) was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Even the presence of acute myocardial infarction, which may be due to the dissection involving a coronary ostium (particularly the right coronary artery), should not entirely exclude the option of rapid surgical intervention. However, patients with a stroke in progress are at increased risk for hemorrhagic cerebral infarction due to intraoperative heparinization. Thus, hemorrhagic stroke is a relative contraindication to urgent surgical intervention, as are major comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H2835945847\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>In one of the IRAD studies, patients with acute type A dissection who were older than 69 years of age were less likely to be treated surgically compared with younger patients (64 versus 86 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, older age alone should not preclude surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>]. In the registry report, although in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (38 versus 23 percent), it was lower in older patients treated surgically compared with medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, surgery should be considered in older patients, even some octogenarians with an otherwise good prognosis and few comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Women were also less likely to be treated surgically (71 versus 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As with older patients, women have a higher in-hospital mortality with surgical treatment than men (32 versus 22 percent), but they have a lower mortality compared with medical therapy (32 versus 54 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044166041\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the imaging necessary to confirm the diagnosis of type A aortic dissection, other studies may be useful to evaluate the patient for concomitant coronary artery disease, particularly the right coronary artery, or aortic valve disease prior to urgent surgical repair of the ascending aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Older patients with acute aortic dissection may have a significant prevalence of coronary artery disease, some have suggested that coronary angiography should be performed prior to surgery so that bypass surgery on critical stenosis can be performed while the patient is under cardiopulmonary bypass. There has also been concern that the presence of undiagnosed critical coronary stenoses may make weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass more difficult and can increase the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction or death. We do <strong>not</strong> advocate preoperative coronary angiography, since the resulting delay of surgery for type A aortic dissection increases the risk of cardiac tamponade or aortic rupture, and engaging the native coronary arteries may be technically difficult due to the dissection. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may identify regional wall motion abnormalities that would need to be considered and addressed. Moreover, type A aortic dissection that is compressing the coronary artery ostia (most commonly the right coronary artery) may require bypass as part of the initial treatment.</p><p>The role of percutaneous coronary angiography was evaluated in a study that retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 122 patients who underwent emergency aortic surgery, primarily for a type A aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was no difference in the in-hospital mortality between those who did or did not undergo coronary angiography (22 versus 16 percent), including those who had a prior myocardial infarction, which was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality. Coronary angiography had no impact on the incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (17 versus 25 percent), three-quarters of which were performed because of coronary artery dissection, not atherosclerotic disease. These observations suggest limited value from coronary angiography and support our recommendation of proceeding to surgery as rapidly as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In addition to its important role in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, TEE can define the severity and mechanism of aortic regurgitation that can complicate acute type A aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

At one-year follow-up, the combined endpoint of <span class=\"nowrap\">incomplete/no</span> false lumen thrombosis, aortic dilation, or aortic rupture was significantly less for those who were treated with stent-grafts (per protocol results). Technical failures, loss to follow-up, and crossovers from the best medical therapy group limited the analysis.</p><p>The reported long-term survival rate with medical therapy is approximately 60 to 80 percent at four to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/9,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,49-51</a>], and approximately 40 to 45 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Survival is best for patients with noncommunicating and retrograde dissections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Despite fair survival among patients treated medically, spontaneous healing of the dissection, characterized by disappearance of the false lumen due to complete thrombosis, is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/36,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,52,53</a>]. Continued flow through the false lumen (patent false lumen), which occurs with either partial thrombosis or no significant thrombosis, has been postulated to prevent healing. The relationship between long-term prognosis and the degree of patency of the false lumen was evaluated in 201 hospital survivors of type B acute aortic dissection who were enrolled in IRAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Complete false lumen patency or partial thrombosis was present in 57 and 34 percent of patients, respectively. The mean three-year mortality rate was significantly worse in patients with partial thrombosis compared with those with complete patency (32 versus 14 percent). With longer-term follow-up of five years, the risk of all-cause mortality was again not significant for endovascular versus medical treatment (11.1 versus 19.3 percent). However, aorta-specific mortality (6.9 versus 19.3 percent) and progression (27 versus 46.1 percent) were significantly lower for endovascular compared with optimal medical treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2942939574\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intervention (surgical or endovascular) for descending thoracic aortic dissection is generally reserved for patients who develop complications including occlusion of a major aortic branch leading to end-organ ischemia (ie, malperfusion), persistent severe hypertension or chest pain, propagation of the dissection (as may be manifested by persistent or recurrent pain), aneurysmal expansion, expanding hematoma, or rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-aortic-dissection/abstract/6,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,54,55</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4173117745\" class=\"local\">'Ascending (type A) aortic dissection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta#H183094929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of open surgical repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;, section on 'Ascending aorta'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are hemodynamically stable with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, we suggest initial medial therapy, rather than intervention (open surgery or endovascular treatment) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Indications for intervention for type B dissection include occlusion of a major aortic branch leading to end-organ ischemia, persistent severe hypertension or pain, propagation of the dissection (as may be manifested by persistent or recurrent pain), aneurysm expansion, and aortic rupture. Acute distal dissections in patients with Marfan syndrome may also be best treated with surgery. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Descending (type B) aortic dissection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-management-of-type-b-aortic-dissection#H534617607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular management of type B aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Indications for intervention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat surgery is required in up to one-half of patients at 10-year follow-up, usually because of extension or recurrence of dissection at the previous site of intervention, localized aneurysm formation remote from the site of repair, graft dehiscence or infection, or aortic regurgitation. The rate of secondary intervention following thoracic stent-grafting due to endoleak or device migration is also high (up to 25 percent) and depends on the duration of follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H4186770523\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment of aortic dissection (medical or surgical), the patients should be maintained on anti-impulse therapy to minimize aortic wall stress with a target blood pressure of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">120/80</span> mmHg. Predischarge advanced vascular imaging using magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomographic (CT) angiography should be performed with follow-up examinations at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter to detect signs of dissection progression, re-dissection, or aneurysm formation (even if the patient remains asymptomatic). We prefer thoracic MR for younger patients, but chest CT scanning is an alternative; however, CT exposes the patient to ongoing radiation and requires iodinated contrast. Alternating chest CT and thoracic MR imaging is a reasonable option with possible use of noncontrast MR to reduce repeated gadolinium exposure. (See <a href=\"#H687808317\" class=\"local\">'Long-term management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104777065\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
