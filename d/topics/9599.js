The main symptoms are fever, and swelling and redness in the areas with inflammation, such as the eyes, lips, hands, and feet. The illness can start with symptoms similar to a cold or stomach bug. It is most common in children younger than 5 years old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13205781\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes Kawasaki disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause is not known.

But some children with Kawasaki disease need tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound of the heart (&quot;echocardiogram&quot;) &ndash; This test creates pictures of the heart as it beats.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13205826\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Kawasaki disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for Kawasaki disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Immune globulin</a> (also called IVIG) &ndash; This treatment goes into a vein through a thin tube, called an &quot;IV.&quot; This is done in a hospital over a period of 8 to 12 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Aspirin</a></p><p/><p>If your child gets IVIG, he or she might not be able to get certain vaccines (such as for measles or chicken pox) for at least a year.

These children might be treated with steroids along with IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p>Children with Kawasaki disease who don't get treatment are at risk for heart problems.
