The development of these atrial arrhythmias prolongs hospital stay and is associated with worse long-term prognosis. Other supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial arrhythmias such as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia, are not common in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, predictors, clinical course, prevention, and management of AF and atrial flutter occurring after cardiac surgery. Most of the observations on atrial arrhythmias come from patients who developed atrial fibrillation. Our approach to patients with atrial flutter is similar, unless otherwise specified. </p><p>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias after cardiac surgery and arrhythmias after cardiac transplantation are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative AF is likely related to a combination of perioperative factors. These include pre-existing degenerative changes in the atrial myocardium and perioperative conditions that result in abnormalities of several electrophysiologic parameters that promote the development of AF, such as dispersion of atrial refractoriness, increase in phase 3 depolarization, enhanced automaticity, increased interatrial conduction time, and decreased conduction velocity, atrial transmembrane potentials, and fluid and electrolyte shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].

We feel the evidence is not strong enough for us to recommend one beta blocker over another. When possible, we start beta blockers at least 48 hours before surgery, due to concerns about the induction of excessive bradycardia. In addition, some experts are concerned about the increased risk of stroke seen in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who receive beta blockers soon before surgery.

If a patient is a candidate for initiation of a beta blocker but presents within the 48-hour window, our reviewers have differing approaches. Some will start low dose beta blocker at any time before surgery, while others will wait until after the patient has returned to the intensive care unit and is deemed &ldquo;stable.&rdquo; </p><p>The optimal duration of therapy for prevention of postoperative atrial arrhythmias is uncertain, but we often continue the beta blocker until the first postoperative visit.

While the evidence is not robust, prevention of AF may lead to a lowering of the risk of in-hospital stroke and a shortened length of stay. In addition, successful prevention of AF will prevent the need for anticoagulation in some patients.

We are uncertain as to the optimal management of these patients, in part because it is not known whether postoperative AF represents the same arrhythmia as AF occurring without cardiac surgery or if it possesses a similar natural history in terms of portending adverse events.</p><p>We think the initial management should include correction of predisposing factors such as hypoxemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and hemodynamic instability as well as pain management and withdrawal of stimulating factors such as inotropic agents. Subsequent management relates to the issues of rate control versus rhythm control cardioversion and anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. </p><p>Options for management of AF include rate or rhythm control strategies.

The benefit is partly due to blockade of the augmented postoperative sympathetic state and to prevention of beta blocker withdrawal in patients on beta blockers preoperatively. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>, a beta blocker with a short half-life, can be given for acute rate control if there is a concern for bradyarrhythmias, hypotension, or bronchospasm. Slowing of the ventricular rate in many AF patients receiving inotropic agents postoperatively can be achieved by lowering the dose or discontinuation of these agents.</p><p>The optimal rate goal for patients with AF after cardiac surgery has not been determined. As these patients vary widely in many clinical features (co-morbidities, need for rapid ventricular rate, etc), we suggest that the optimal ventricular rate be determined on a case by case basis. In many patients, a ventricular rate of less than 110 beats per minute will prevent symptoms such as palpitations and allow for optimal cardiac performance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Rate control goals'</a>.). </p><p>Calcium channel blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> are other atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers that can control the ventricular rate in AF, but they are not more effective than beta blockers. In patients in whom alternate agents have not been successful in controlling the rate in atrial fibrillation, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> can be used to slow the ventricular response.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and time course'</a> above.)</p><p>Restoration of sinus rhythm is indicated in symptomatic patients or in those when rate control is difficult to achieve. An attempt at the restoration of sinus rhythm can be beneficial in patients with a low ejection fraction. In addition, cardioversion in asymptomatic patients may be reasonable when well-tolerated AF occurs near the time of anticipated hospital discharge or when it does not spontaneously terminate within 24 hours, so that oral anticoagulation can be avoided; this is particularly true in patients at high risk of bleeding. We believe that an attempt at cardioversion with either electrical or pharmacologic therapy is reasonable. The choice between the two should be made on local practice and patient conditions. </p><p>Electrical therapy of AF involves direct current external transthoracic cardioversion and it is effective in approximately 95 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias&quot;</a>). For patients who are refractory to transthoracic cardioversion or when reversion is desirable but the patient's respiratory status makes anesthesia for electrical conversion potentially difficult, pharmacologic therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is reasonable.

The choice between the two strategies should take into account patient and physician preferences. Advantages of a rate control strategy include the absence of side effects from drug therapy; disadvantages include a slower resolution of AF, thereby leading to a potentially greater need for anticoagulation at discharge. In many patients, we chose a rhythm control strategy.</p><p>In a study of patients with no history of AF undergoing cardiac surgery, 523 individuals were randomly assigned to either rate or rhythm control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

If AF persisted for 24 to 48 hours, electrical cardioversion was recommended. The primary end point was the total number of days of hospitalization within 60 days after randomization. There was no difference between the two groups in the primary outcome (median, 5.1 and 5 days, respectively; p = 0.76). This study had limitations, such as including heterogenous patients and lacking the power to assess effect on death or serious adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53913896\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients on long-term anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For AF patients who are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or direct oral anticoagulants, we suggest stopping this therapy at least three days before surgery.

However, a reduction of events with anticoagulant therapy in this population has never been well studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>As factors other than AF contribute to in-hospital stroke rates, it is not clear that aggressive early anticoagulation (eg, intravenous heparin as a bridge to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) will reduce the incidence of stroke. In addition, the bleeding risk associated with anticoagulation in the immediate postoperative period (within the first 48 hours in most patients) makes the overall impact of this approach less certain. The potential complications associated with anticoagulation were illustrated in several observational series of patients who were treated with intravenous heparin or oral anticoagulants for a variety of indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/138-140\" class=\"abstract_t\">138-140</a>].

However, one report found a significant increase in large pericardial effusions and tamponade in patients treated with warfarin, particularly when the International normalized ratio (INR) was above the therapeutic target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].
