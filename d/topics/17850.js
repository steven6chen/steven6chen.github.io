Menopause is associated with a marked decrease in ovarian estrogen production. The low estrogen levels in postmenopausal women may trigger vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) and, in time, the onset of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, including vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (genitourinary syndrome of menopause [GSM]). Estrogen is the most effective treatment available for relief of menopausal symptoms, most importantly hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and dyspareunia. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT; estrogen alone or combined with a progestin) is currently indicated for management of menopausal symptoms. Long-term use for prevention of disease is no longer recommended. The treatment of menopausal symptoms with MHT (estrogen alone or combined with progestin) will be reviewed here. An overview of the risks and benefits of estrogen, available hormone preparations, and an overview of menopausal therapies for women who choose not to or cannot take estrogen are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610946192\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the broad term used to describe both unopposed estrogen use for women who have undergone hysterectomy and combined estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) for women with an intact uterus who need a progestin to prevent estrogen-associated endometrial hyperplasia. By convention, unopposed estrogen therapy is known as ET, combined estrogen-progestin therapy as EPT, and menopausal hormone therapy as MHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610946264\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of MHT is to relieve menopausal symptoms, most importantly hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms). Other symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause that respond to ET include mood <span class=\"nowrap\">lability/depression,</span> vaginal atrophy, dyspareunia, sleep disturbances (when related to hot flashes), and, in some cases, joint aches and pains. The management of vasomotor symptoms and the use of vaginal estrogen for vaginal atrophy are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women being treated for menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes require systemic estrogen; women being treated only for vulvovaginal atrophy (now referred to as &quot;genitourinary syndrome of menopause&quot; [GSM]) should be treated with low-dose vaginal estrogen rather than systemic estrogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, MHT was also used by some clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease [CHD] and osteoporosis. However, we do not recommend MHT for prevention of disease given the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a set of two large, randomized trials that demonstrated an unfavorable risk-benefit profile of MHT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610946282\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of patient age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the WHI clearly demonstrated adverse effects of MHT in older postmenopausal women (over age 60 years), this is not the age group that presents with new onset of menopausal symptoms. Almost all women who seek medical therapy for menopausal symptoms do so in their late 40s or 50s. Women in this age group should be reassured that the absolute risk of complications for healthy, young postmenopausal women taking MHT for five years is very low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87938 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H507693\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Estimates of risk in women 50 to 59 years'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4163642015\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common indication for MHT is vasomotor symptoms (or hot flashes). Vasomotor symptoms occur most often in the late menopausal transition and early postmenopause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 2</a>). Although there are alternative therapies for vasomotor symptoms, none are as effective as estrogen. The physiology, clinical manifestations (including insomnia), and treatment of hot flashes (including intractable hot flashes) are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another common indication for estrogen therapy is vulvovaginal atrophy or GSM. The epithelial linings of the vagina and urethra are very sensitive to estrogen, and estrogen deficiency leads to thinning of the vaginal epithelium. This results in GSM (also called vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginitis), causing symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, dyspareunia, and sometimes urinary symptoms. Both systemic and vaginal estrogen are effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, but we suggest <strong>vaginal</strong> rather than systemic estrogen for women who have only GSM without other menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations of the menopausal transition and menopause are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other potential indications for MHT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mood <span class=\"nowrap\">lability/depression</strong></span> &ndash; MHT, alone or in combination with an antidepressant such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is effective for women who experience mood lability or depression during the menopausal transition. (See <a href=\"#H610946331\" class=\"local\">'Depression in perimenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint aches and pains</strong> &ndash; It is unclear if the pain is related to estrogen deficiency or a rheumatologic disorder, but in the WHI, women with joint pain or stiffness at baseline were more likely to get relief with either combined EPT or unopposed ET than with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause#H159313632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;, section on 'Joint pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p>MHT is no longer recommended for prevention of chronic disease (CHD or osteoporosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, we do not suggest its use for cognitive function or prevention of dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CHD</strong> &ndash; We suggest <strong>not</strong> using MHT for the prevention of CHD, even in young postmenopausal women. Although the risk profile appears to be more favorable in young women taking unopposed estrogen, use for prevention is still not warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The hormone regimen studied in the WHI was conjugated estrogens and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA). While it is possible that other estrogen or progestin formulations or doses might not have the same negative cardiovascular effects as conjugated estrogen and MPA, data to support their use for prevention are not available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk&quot;, section on 'Timing of exposure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteoporosis</strong> &ndash; Although we previously recommended estrogen as a first-line choice for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, we now recommend bisphosphonates. However, in the occasional patient with persistent menopausal symptoms who cannot tolerate first- and second-line therapies for osteoporosis, estrogen may be a reasonable option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H1289691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Estrogen/progestin therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive function and dementia</strong> &ndash; We currently do <strong>not</strong> suggest the routine use of MHT for peri- and postmenopausal women who are experiencing cognitive symptoms (memory loss and difficulty concentrating). Although substantial biologic evidence supports the importance of estrogen to cognitive function, clinical trial evidence has generally ruled out any global (but not domain-specific) cognitive benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-and-cognitive-function#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen and cognitive function&quot;, section on 'Clinical trial evidence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using MHT to prevent dementia. Although some epidemiologic data suggest that estrogen may be beneficial, clinical trials of MHT administered to women over age 65 years showed harm. Strong evidence of cognitive benefits for women taking MHT at younger ages (eg, near menopause) is also lacking, and thus, MHT should not be prescribed for preservation of cognitive function in younger women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-and-cognitive-function#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen and cognitive function&quot;, section on 'Clinical trial data'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1345819194\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to MHT include a history of breast cancer, CHD, a previous venous thromboembolic event or stroke, active liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, high-risk endometrial cancer, or transient ischemic attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Oral estrogens should be avoided in women with hypertriglyceridemia, active gallbladder disease, or known thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden (without a personal history of venous thromboembolism [VTE]).

(See <a href=\"#H1345819194\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>The 2015 clinical practice guideline published by the Endocrine Society presents an individualized approach to treatment based upon calculating a woman's baseline cardiovascular and breast cancer risks prior to initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar to most other guidelines, the Endocrine Society agrees that MHT is indicated for the management of menopausal symptoms but not for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis, or dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3057488884\"><span class=\"h3\">Calculating risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Endocrine Society guideline suggests calculating cardiovascular and breast cancer risks before initiating MHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They suggest nonhormonal therapies for symptomatic women who are at high risk (&gt;10 percent 10-year risk) for CVD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107770 \">table 1</a>) or moderate (1.67 to 5 percent five-year risk) to high risk (&gt;5 percent) for breast cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107769 \">table 2</a>). For women at moderate risk of CVD (5 to 10 percent 10-year risk), they suggest transdermal rather than oral estrogen, with micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> for those with a uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107770 \">table 1</a>). They note that a population-based CVD risk calculator should be used to estimate CVD risk (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). An online tool such as the National Cancer Institute <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/&amp;token=+4cBCd4hrat9fnIyIQ2cmJzDGGoIAAUEfKBFzUd5ZoNNrqlJRsEjpxj7xTxN2fWA&amp;TOPIC_ID=7450\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a> can be used to assess five-year breast cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Prior to initiating MHT the patient should be up-to-date on breast cancer screening tests.</p><p>Although this represents the ideal approach, a formal CVD calculation may not be necessary in a thin, healthy, nonhypertensive, nondiabetic patient who is well known to the clinician. For women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), they also suggest transdermal estrogen with a progestin that has a neutral effect on coagulation parameters (eg, micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>).</p><p>Vaginal estrogen is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, and assessment of CVD and breast cancer risk is generally not needed when low-dose vaginal estrogen is prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Starting estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a decision has been made to treat a postmenopausal woman with estrogen, consideration should be given to the type of estrogen and the route by which it is to be given, as well as the need for progestin and the most appropriate progestin regimen. Estrogen is available in many forms: oral, transdermal, topical gels and lotions, intravaginal creams and tablets, and vaginal rings. In some countries, estrogen can also be given as a subcutaneous implant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The potency and therefore the doses of these estrogen preparations differ, but they differ little in efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Vaginal estrogen is most commonly used in very low doses for the management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), also known as vaginal atrophy. However, high doses of vaginal estrogen can also be used to treat vasomotor symptoms, much like a transdermal preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We do not recommend these high doses (ie, systemic estrogen doses) in women who need therapy for genitourinary symptoms only.

The transdermal route is particularly important in women with hypertriglyceridemia or risk factors for thromboembolism.</p><p>However, the baseline risk of both VTE and stroke is very low in otherwise healthy, young postmenopausal women. Therefore, if a patient prefers an oral preparation over a transdermal one (cost or personal preference), we consider oral estrogen to be safe. We typically choose oral 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> preparations although some clinicians prefer conjugated estrogens, a preparation that has been popular historically (and the preparation studied in the Women's Health Initiative [WHI]). Details on the types of estrogen preparations are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Estrogen preparations'</a>.)</p><p>All routes of estrogen administration appear to be equally effective for symptom relief (and bone density), but their metabolic effects differ:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral estrogen has more favorable effects on lipid profiles, but there is no evidence that this results in long-term clinical benefit. On the other hand, oral estrogens are associated with increases in serum triglycerides and C-reactive protein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk&quot;, section on 'Lipids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral estrogens increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) more than transdermal preparations, which results in lower free testosterone concentrations. In theory, this could result in a negative impact on libido and sexual function, but this has not been proven. Similar effects on thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and bioavailable thyroxine (T4) occur with oral estrogen (increased TBG and lower bioavailable T4). Oral estrogens also increase cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), resulting in an increase in total serum cortisol. Interpreting serum cortisol values in a woman taking oral estrogen can therefore be misleading. (See <a href=\"#H497589200\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting oral estrogen metabolism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks of VTE and stroke appear to be higher with oral when compared with transdermal estrogen.

These doses eliminate hot flashes completely in approximately 80 percent of women and reduce the frequency and severity in the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In the past, a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to estrogen dosing was used, with oral conjugated estrogen (0.625 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or its equivalent oral 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or transdermal 17-beta estradiol (0.05 mg [50 mcg]), prescribed to most women.

In a survey of compounding and community pharmacies in the United States, it was estimated that prescription rates for custom-compounded bioidentical hormones now approach those of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MHT prescriptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Similar results were reported in a second study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This highlights the importance of clinician and patient education about the differences between approved products and less-regulated hormone formulations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1921827554\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of androgen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The known decrease in ovarian androgen production rates and serum androgen concentrations has caused concern that menopause might be associated with a decline in libido. An age-associated decline in sexual desire has been observed in both men and women. However, it is unclear whether the decline in libido in women is age or menopause related, since studies in women have not shown a significant correlation between libido and the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> or testosterone concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials of exogenous testosterone replacement suggest modest benefits of testosterone therapy in some postmenopausal women. However, there are potential risks associated with androgen replacement, and the use of testosterone is limited by the lack of approved and commercially available products for women. Until the beneficial effects of androgen replacement are better established, it cannot be routinely recommended to postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of androgen deficiency and therapy in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Management&quot;, section on 'Androgens'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610946547\"><span class=\"h2\">Migraines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migraine headaches (with or without aura) are not considered to be a contraindication to MHT. For women with hot flashes and estrogen-associated migraines (which typically worsen during perimenopause), estrogen therapy (ET) often improves both symptoms. In this setting, we suggest continuous transdermal hormone regimens (as opposed to cyclic regimens) to avoid triggering estrogen-withdrawal headaches. The effect of MHT on stroke risk in postmenopausal women with migraines is not well studied. However, low doses of transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (&le;50 mcg, the dose range we routinely recommend) have not been associated with an excess risk of stroke in normal women (see <a href=\"#H1130128347\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above). The topics of menopause, hormone therapy, and migraine are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-associated-migraine#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen-associated migraine&quot;, section on 'Migraines and menopause'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610946331\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression in perimenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mood disorders are common during the menopausal transition, often coexisting with vasomotor symptoms. Our approach is to choose initial therapy based upon the woman's predominant symptom. If her main concern is depression and hot flashes are not severe, we start with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). On the other hand, if vasomotor symptoms are the major symptom and depression or mood symptoms are mild, we start with MHT (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Starting estrogen'</a> above). For women in whom depression and vasomotor symptoms are both severe, we start both estrogen and an SSRI and refer to a psychopharmacologist for further consultation and monitoring. In our experience, many women require both MHT and estrogen for optimal symptom relief. The efficacy of estrogen for depression occurring after menopause is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The risk of depression during perimenopause is higher than during the pre- or postmenopausal years. Perimenopausal depression includes both new-onset (first episode) depression as well as a relapse in women with a history of depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause#H952676297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;, section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p>In one trial of ET for perimenopausal depression, 50 perimenopausal women with major depression, dysthymia, or minor depressive disorders received transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (0.1 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. Remission of depression occurred in 68 percent of patients compared with only 20 percent receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), a trial of MHT in younger menopausal women ages 45 to 54 years who underwent extensive mood evaluations, reported that four years of oral estrogen appeared to improve mood, as women receiving oral conjugated estrogen combined with micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> had lower depression and anxiety scores than those receiving either transdermal estradiol with micronized progesterone or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>SSRIs are effective for perimenopausal depression, and some provide modest benefit for hot flashes as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes#H73748457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;, section on 'Nonhormonal pharmacotherapy'</a>). Data also suggest that adding estrogen to antidepressant therapy may result in additional benefit for perimenopausal women with depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary ovarian insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a set of MHT trials in older postmenopausal women, should not be extrapolated to women with premature ovarian failure (now termed primary ovarian insufficiency [POI], defined as menopause before age 40 years). Hormone therapy is started at a younger age in these women, and current guidelines suggest that therapy should be continued until the average age of menopause (age 50 to 51 years) to prevent premature bone loss, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke. At that point, if hormone therapy is stopped and menopausal symptoms are moderate to severe, the same discussion of potential risks and benefits of MHT should take place.

The epidemiologic data and clinical trial data have been inconsistent, but the increased risk of breast cancer recurrence with ET in one trial (Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer &ndash; Is It Safe? [HABITS]) is of great concern. We therefore do <strong>not</strong> recommend estrogen for women with a personal history of breast cancer. We suggest that other established means of controlling symptoms or preventing osteoporosis should be utilized before considering ET in these women.

Exceptions include women with a history of breast cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), a previous venous thromboembolic event or stroke, active liver disease, or those at high risk for these complications. (See <a href=\"#H290558928\" class=\"local\">'Choosing candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest transdermal 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> for many women starting MHT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The transdermal route is particularly important in women with hypertriglyceridemia or risk factors for thromboembolism. However, the baseline risk of both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke is very low in otherwise healthy, young postmenopausal women. Therefore, if a patient prefers an oral preparation over a transdermal one (cost or personal preference), we consider oral estrogen to be safe. All types and routes of estrogen are equally effective for hot flashes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Starting estrogen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who experience recurrent, bothersome hot flashes after stopping estrogen, we initially suggest nonhormonal options.
