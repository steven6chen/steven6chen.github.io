The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) found that postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 6 percent of 165,196 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a separate study, postoperative pulmonary complications were the most costly of major postoperative medical complications (including cardiac, thromboembolic, and infectious) and resulted in the longest length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As the impact of pulmonary complications following surgery has become increasingly apparent, estimation of their risk should be a standard element of all preoperative medical evaluations.</p><p>The definition of postoperative pulmonary complications, pertinent anesthetic physiology, identification of patient and procedure-related risk factors, and the role of preoperative pulmonary function testing and pulmonary risk indices will be reviewed here. Strategies for reducing postoperative pulmonary complications and the evaluation of candidates for lung resection surgery are discussed separately.

This wide range is due in part to patient selection and procedure-related risk factors, although differing definitions for postoperative complications account for much of the variability and make comparison of reported incidences across different studies difficult.</p><p>The preferred definition is a postoperative pulmonary abnormality that produces identifiable disease or dysfunction that is clinically significant and adversely affects the clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This would include several major categories of clinically significant complications, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atelectasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection, including bronchitis and pneumonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory failure (mechanical ventilation for &gt;48 hours after surgery or unplanned reintubation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbation of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma</p><p/><p>The rate of postoperative pulmonary complications across all types of surgery was 6.8 percent in a systematic review of studies that provided explicit outcome definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE PULMONARY PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative pulmonary complications follow logically as an extension of normal perioperative pulmonary physiology. Reduced lung volume after surgery is a major factor contributing to the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.</p><p>Thoracic and upper-abdominal surgery are associated with a reduction in lung volumes in a restrictive pattern as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital capacity (VC) is reduced by 50 to 60 percent and may remain decreased for up to one week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced by about 30 percent.</p><p/><p>Diaphragmatic dysfunction appears to play the most important role in these changes; postoperative pain and splinting are also factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Reduction of the FRC below closing volumes contributes to the risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, and <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatching. Microatelectasis results in areas of the lung that are perfused but not ventilated, leading to impaired gas exchange with consequent postoperative hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A decrease in tidal volume, loss of sighing breaths, and increase in respiratory rate occur after abdominal and thoracic surgery and contribute to the risk of complications. In addition, residual effects of anesthetic agents and postoperative opioids both depress the respiratory drive. Inhibition of cough and impairment of mucociliary clearance of respiratory secretions are factors that contribute to the risk of postoperative infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Lower abdominal surgery is associated with similar changes but to a lesser degree. Reductions in lung volumes are not seen with surgery on the extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT-RELATED RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for pulmonary complications can be grouped into patient-related and procedure-related risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The potential patient-related factors that have been studied include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General health status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper-respiratory infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic and nutritional factors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The influence of age as an independent predictor of postoperative pulmonary complications has been questioned. Early studies suggested an increased risk of pulmonary complications with advanced age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These studies, however, were not adjusted for overall health status or the presence of known pulmonary disease, and subsequent studies did not reliably demonstrate age as a predictor of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The risk of surgical mortality was similar across age groups when stratified by American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review prepared for the American College of Physicians estimated the impact of age on postoperative pulmonary complications among studies that used multivariable analysis to adjust for age-related comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This review made the novel observation that age &gt;50 years was an important independent predictor of risk. When compared with patients &lt;50 years old, patients aged 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and &ge;80 years had odds ratios (OR) of 1.5 (CI 1.31-1.71), 2.28 (CI 1.86-2.80), 3.90 (CI 2.70-5.65), and 5.63 (CI 4.63-6.85), respectively, of developing pulmonary complications. Therefore, even healthy older patients carry a substantial risk of pulmonary complications after surgery. This is in sharp contrast to perioperative cardiac risk, where age is not an independent risk factor after adjusting for confounders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COPD is an important patient-related risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. In an observational study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database including over 450,000 patients, unadjusted rates of postoperative pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, and reintubation among patients with COPD were 6.5 percent, 8.8 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A systematic review found that among studies that used multivariable analysis to adjust for patient-related confounders, the odds ratio for postoperative pulmonary complications attributable to COPD was 2.36 (CI 1.90-2.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the NSQIP observational study described above, after adjusting for confounders, COPD was an independent predictor for postoperative pneumonia (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.59-1.83), reintubation (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.42-1.66), and failure to wean from the ventilator (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.35-1.56), in addition to non-pulmonary adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Despite the increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with obstructive lung disease, there appears to be no prohibitive level of pulmonary function below which surgery is absolutely contraindicated. This was illustrated in a study of 12 very high-risk patients as defined by older criteria of inoperability (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &lt;1 liter) in which only 3 of 15 surgeries were associated with postoperative complications and no deaths occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another report of surgery in patients with severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent predicted), mortality was 5.6 percent (primarily related to a high mortality rate after cardiac surgery) and severe postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 6.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The benefit of surgery must be weighed against the known risks; even very high-risk patients may proceed to surgery if the indication is sufficiently compelling.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis of 107 cohort and case-control studies, preoperative smoking was associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, including pulmonary complications (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Smokers with a greater than 20 pack-year smoking history have a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications than those with a lesser pack-year history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic changes that accompany morbid obesity include reduction in lung volumes, <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch, and relative hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These findings might be expected to accentuate similar changes seen with anesthesia and increase the risk of pulmonary complications.</p><p>However, obesity has consistently been shown not to be a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. A review of 10 series of obese gastric bypass patients, as an example, showed a 3.9 percent incidence of pneumonia and atelectasis, a rate similar to that seen in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'American College of Physicians guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of measures of pulmonary function have been evaluated. Spirometry is widely available, and measures of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC) have been frequently reported.

As an example, in a study of patients with severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent predicted), preoperative PFTs did not predict the risk of pulmonary complications, whereas length of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, and type of procedure were all significant predictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>In a report of 11,217 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, authors stratified patients based on spirometric values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. After adjustment, while severe COPD (as defined by spirometric values) conferred higher rates of early mortality, there was no impact on rates of prolonged mechanical ventilation. Similarly, in a case control study of 164 patients undergoing abdominal surgery, no component of spirometry predicted pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A critical review of preoperative pulmonary function testing evaluated 14 studies that met strict methodologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

They represent an extension of the normal physiologic changes in the lung that occur with anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definite patient-related risk factors for these complications include the following: age &gt;50 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, poor general health status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class &gt;2), functional dependence, obstructive sleep apnea, current cigarette use, pulmonary hypertension, low oxygen saturation, and serum albumin &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure-related risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications include surgery lasting more than three hours, emergency surgery, use of long-acting neuromuscular blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancuronium</a>), and upper abdominal, thoracic, aortic, head and neck, neurosurgery, and abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Procedure-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional risk factors that are considered probable include the following: general anesthesia (compared to spinal or epidural anesthesia), hypercapnia (arterial tension of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;45 mmHg), abnormal chest radiograph, cigarette use within the previous eight weeks, and current upper respiratory tract infection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient-related risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Procedure-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful history and physical examination are the most important tools for preoperative risk assessment of patients for potential postoperative pulmonary complications. Attention should be paid to symptoms that suggest underlying lung disease (eg, exercise intolerance, cough, and unexplained dyspnea). In addition, the clinician should inquire about known risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications. A high-risk patient may benefit from aggressive strategies to reduce pulmonary complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56866 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In selected patients, preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest radiograph, and exercise testing may identify risk factors that require attention preoperatively. Current data do not support the use of preoperative arterial blood gas analyses to stratify risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above.) As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PFTs should be obtained in patients with uncharacterized dyspnea or exercise intolerance and for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma where clinical evaluation cannot determine if airflow obstruction has been optimally reduced. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A chest radiograph within the past six months is reasonable in patients undergoing high-risk surgery who are over age 50 years, or who have cardiac or pulmonary disease suggested by the clinical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiographs'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to assess patients with abnormal PFTs to determine the safety of planned lung resection surgery. CPET may also have a role in the evaluation of patients with unexplained dyspnea who are undergoing major surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four different pulmonary risk indices are available to provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of respiratory failure, pneumonia, or general pulmonary complications. Each risk index has different strengths and weaknesses. We use the ARISCAT index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ariscat-canet-preoperative-pulmonary-risk-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). These tools are a useful starting point when estimating pulmonary risk before major noncardiac surgery, and they guide conversations with the patient and surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of postoperative pulmonary risk'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Yang CK, Teng A, Lee DY, Rose K.
