Opiates belong to the larger class of drugs, the opioids, which include synthetic and semi-synthetic drugs, as well.</p><p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network in the United States estimates there were 162,137 heroin-related emergency department visits and 37,007 unspecified opiate-related emergency department visits in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to opioid overdose, a significant number of these visits related to opioid withdrawal.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical features and management of opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting. A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68306 \">table 1</a>). Discussions of opioid withdrawal during detoxification treatment, opioid intoxication, opioid withdrawal in neonates, and general management of the poisoned patient are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeated, regular use of opioids produces tolerance that predisposes an individual toward withdrawal. Chronic opioid exposure causes adaptations that increase excitability in neurons in the locus ceruleus, the major noradrenergic center in the brain. The presence of opioids brings these neurons toward their normal firing rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast number of opioids precludes presenting pharmacokinetic data for each one here. A few clinically important generalizations can be made. The majority of opioids have volumes of distribution of 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> which makes removal of a significant quantity of drug by hemodialysis impossible. They have variable protein binding (from 89 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> to 7.1 percent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>) and are renally eliminated. Many opioids are metabolized to active metabolites. Examples include hydrocodone (metabolized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> by Cytochrome [CY] P2D6) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide). Cytochrome P polymorphisms cause variations in clinical effect.</p><p>The most clinically important pharmacokinetic difference is a wide variation in serum half-life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70480 \">table 2</a>). The half-life data in these tables, taken from healthy subjects receiving therapeutic doses, should only serve as a rough guide to duration of clinical effect. Actual effects are influenced by dose, an individual's tolerance, and the presence of active metabolites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OPIOID WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is often difficult to differentiate drug-seeking behavior from true withdrawal. It is also often (erroneously) asserted that opioid withdrawal is never life-threatening. While this conventional wisdom is usually true for &quot;naturally occurring&quot; withdrawal, iatrogenic withdrawal (from a reversal agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>, as in the setting of Ultra Rapid Opioid Detoxification) can produce sudden surges in catecholamines and hemodynamic instability that some patients may not tolerate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In opioid-dependent individuals, opioid withdrawal begins almost immediately after receiving an antagonist, and over a few hours after cessation of use. Partial agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a>) and agonist-antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>) can also rapidly produce withdrawal, so for the purpose of this review, the term &quot;antagonist&quot; will be discussed in relation to these drugs as well.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of withdrawal may begin 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of a short-acting opioid and 24 to 48 hours after cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>. Withdrawal symptoms typically peak within 24 to 48 hours of onset, but may persist for several days with short-acting agents and up to two weeks with methadone.</p><p>Patients experiencing opioid withdrawal may complain of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphoria and restlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinorrhea and lacrimation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias and arthralgias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea</p><p/><p>Some or all of these symptoms may be present, and the severity depends on the individual's tolerance to opioids, the continued presence of opioid in the serum and end organs, and the duration of time over which the withdrawal has occurred. As an example, a person who is tolerant to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> who was administered 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> intravenously would experience much more severe symptoms than someone taking 10 mg of methadone daily who stopped abruptly (ie, &quot;cold turkey&quot;). A thorough history should ascertain why the patient discontinued opioid use, to ensure there is not another underlying medical condition that precluded them from obtaining the drug.</p><p>The use of a validated scale, such as the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994 \">table 3</a>), may facilitate diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic response in patients in opioid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid withdrawal is characterized by mydriasis (pupillary dilation), yawning, sweating, increased bowel sounds, and piloerection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81045 \">table 4</a>). If the patient is in severe distress, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate may be increased. Hypotension may be present in the setting of volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea. Temperature is normal and, with the exception of very severe cases, mental status is preserved. The Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F106994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106994 \">table 3</a>) can be used to help determine the presence of symptoms and signs consistent with opioid withdrawal, and the severity of withdrawal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid withdrawal may appear similar to other withdrawal or intoxication syndromes. Most patients in opioid withdrawal have good insight into their problem, so the diagnosis is usually established by history alone. When present, the findings of yawning, lacrimation and piloerection are helpful because of their specificity.</p><p>Unlike opioid withdrawal, ethanol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal may produce seizures and hyperthermia.</p><p>Ethanol, sedative-hypnotic, and opioid withdrawal can all present with a broad spectrum of severity and vital sign abnormalities, but the first two syndromes are much more likely to cause significant hypertension and tachycardia. Many patients in opioid withdrawal have a pulse and blood pressure within normal limits. Although some in opioid withdrawal have a tachycardia that reflects their agitation, discomfort, or hypovolemia, only a small minority of patients manifest both hypertension and tachycardia. When present, these signs are almost always a result of a surge in catecholamines from iatrogenically-induced withdrawal. Conversely, in ethanol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, normal vital signs are the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>Sympathomimetic intoxication may produce mydriasis, agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension, but these findings are usually much more severe than occur in opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Cholinergic agents, which can cause diarrhea and vomiting, can be distinguished from opioid withdrawal syndrome by salivation, bradycardia, and altered level of consciousness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with opioid intoxication and withdrawal can be managed without laboratory studies. If the patient presents with a history of significant vomiting or diarrhea, it is prudent to obtain a basic metabolic profile to help assess fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321658047\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal from interruption in opioid use</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Opioid agonist therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68306 \">table 1</a>). If withdrawal was produced by an interruption in opioid use, symptoms can be managed with either opioids or with non-opioid adjuncts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54978 \">table 5</a>). Whenever possible, we prefer to use a single class of agents for treatment. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> is a good choice for opioid replacement therapy because of its long duration of action. Twenty mg of orally administered methadone or 10 mg of intramuscular methadone are usually sufficient to relieve withdrawal symptoms without producing opioid intoxication. We recommend the intramuscular route, since the nauseated withdrawing patient may vomit after an oral dose. Decades of clinical experience have validated the use of methadone in the management of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine administration of a full daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance dose to an unfamiliar patient who has missed a single dose. Some patients intentionally take reduced doses in order to save a portion, so their prescribed dose may be sold or abused. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321658054\"><span class=\"h3\">Buprenorphine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> is used as substitution therapy to treat opioid dependence. It can be given daily, or several times a week to patients as part of maintenance therapy. Buprenorphine is formulated alone for intravenous and oral administration, and as an oral formulation combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> to discourage crushing and intravenous administration. We suggest that buprenorphine <strong>not</strong> be used routinely to treat acute opioid withdrawal.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Buprenorphine</a> is a partial agonist (ie, it exerts both opioid agonist and antagonist effects), and therefore a theoretical ceiling exists for its potential to cause respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This feature, combined with its long duration of action, make buprenorphine a theoretically attractive therapy for long-term management of opioid dependence. However, the complex pharmacology of buprenorphine creates problems that do not exist with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>.</p><p>First, as a partial agonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> will produce withdrawal in both an opioid intoxicated patient and one undergoing early withdrawal if their preferred drug is still present. If a clinician's diagnosis of opioid withdrawal is incorrect the patient's condition can be made worse by buprenorphine. Second, the drug has a high affinity for opioid receptors, which may require a large dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> to overcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Third, unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, there is no well-established, safe, empiric dose of buprenorphine.</p><p>In the acute setting, there is a clear role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> treatment in those individuals presenting with opioid withdrawal after missing their regular doses of buprenorphine. Otherwise, unless the clinician is familiar with buprenorphine administration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> should remain the drug of choice for managing opioid withdrawal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321658101\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal due to opioid antagonist and other circumstances not amenable to treatment with opioid agonist</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-opioid adjunctive medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68306 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>While opioids are intuitively the ideal agent to treat opioid withdrawal, there are situations when their use is undesirable. As an example, when withdrawal is triggered by an antagonist, it might be difficult to give enough opioid to overcome the antagonist, and rebound opioid intoxication would ensue. Another example would be an individual experiencing withdrawal after intentionally stopping use of opioids to treat an addiction. In such situations, non-opioid adjuncts may be used to manage symptoms. </p><p>In patients with normal or elevated blood pressure, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist may be administered. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clonidine</a> binds to a central alpha 2 adrenergic receptor that shares potassium channels with opioids, and blunts symptoms of withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Lofexidine, which is not available in the United States, presumably exhibits the same mechanism of action. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure while administering alpha 2 adrenergic agonists. Blood pressure should be taken prior to each dose of medication. If hypotension is present, then alpha 2 adrenergic agonist medication should be held. Clonidine may be administered orally in a dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg every hour until symptoms resolve, to a cumulative maximum daily dose of 0.7 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Lofexidine dosing for acute withdrawal has not been established. However, based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug and dosing recommendations for medically supervised detoxification, an initial dose of 0.2 to 0.4 mg is reasonable. This may be followed by a repeat dose in four hours if needed to a maximum of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>Although significant hypertension and tachycardia precipitated by a short-acting antagonist are expected to resolve after brief observation, hemodynamic instability induced by a long-acting drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>) requires pharmacologic management. The clinician should use clinical judgment to determine which patients require more intensive management. As an example, a young patient may tolerate a heart rate of 120, whereas an older patient with coronary artery disease should not be allowed to remain hypertensive and tachycardic for any prolonged period.</p><p>Benzodiazepines are a good supplement to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> therapy because they have an excellent safety profile and clinicians are familiar with their dosing and administration. While not studied well in humans, other GABAergic drugs reduce catecholamine release during severe withdrawal, and the benzodiazepines themselves have been shown to improve withdrawal in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition to clonidine, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, in 10 to 20 mg intravenous aliquots, given every 5 to 10 minutes until adequate sedation and hemodynamic stability are achieved. Benzodiazepines may also be helpful in suppressing muscle cramps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321658108\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms associated with acute opioid withdrawal can be addressed specifically. Suitable medications are summarized in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54978 \">table 5</a>). Antiemetics can be given as needed to control nausea and vomiting. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Promethazine</a>, 25 mg intramuscularly or intravenously, may be a good choice because of its anticholinergic properties. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loperamide</a>, 4 mg orally, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> 50 mcg subcutaneously, may help with diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrarapid opioid detoxification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrarapid Opioid Detoxification (UROD) has been extensively promoted as a faster, more comfortable means of stopping use. In this practice, opioid antagonists are administered under general anesthesia or heavy sedation with the intent of producing withdrawal. In theory, after emerging from anesthesia, the patient has already &quot;slept&quot; through the most difficult period of withdrawal symptoms. Induction may be a better term than detoxification, since the intent of the procedure is not an immediate cure of opioid dependence, but rather a rapid transition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Immediately after the procedure, the patient will still experience withdrawal symptoms, and anxiety and depression may last for weeks to months. Often patients are prescribed agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, and antiemetics to help control withdrawal symptoms at home.</p><p>The procedure is controversial, because it exposes people to the risks of general anesthesia, as well as seizures and hemodynamic instability, without a clear benefit. For these reasons, we do not recommend its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Generally, a patient presenting with symptoms of withdrawal following UROD can be treated like any other patient in withdrawal. Because these individuals are usually given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>, it may be difficult to treat them with opioid agonists. If a patient with implantable subcutaneous naltrexone beads presents in extremis, the beads should be removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses.

Symptoms of NAS include autonomic (sweating, low-grade fever), neurologic (irritability, high-pitched cry, decreased sleeping, myoclonus, tremors, hyperreflexia, yawning, seizures), and gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding) features, and typically begin within 48 to 72 hours of birth. Pharmacological treatment of NAS should be conducted in close consultation with an experienced neonatologist. Possibly more important than the choice of agent is the consistent use of an effective clinical scoring tool to guide treatment. A detailed discussion of NAS is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Children receiving intensive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Critically ill children are often given continuous infusion of opioids to treat pain and can develop tolerance after prolonged therapy. Patients who receive continuous opioid infusions for longer than five days warrant careful weaning of opioid medication under the direction of a pediatric pain specialist (eg, pediatric critical care specialist or pediatric anesthesiologist) and guided by the duration and dose of opioid analgesic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Whenever weaning is anticipated to require more than five to seven days, conversion of continuous opioid infusions to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> is usually performed. During the transition, the physician must ensure equianalgesic dosing. Subsequently, the oral dose is tapered to avoid withdrawal. Evidence regarding the best regimen (degree of daily dose reduction and duration of oral weaning for methadone) is limited. Examples of methadone regimens are provided in the references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated, regular use of opioids produces tolerance that predisposes an individual toward withdrawal.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid withdrawal is characterized by mydriasis, yawning, increased bowel sounds, and piloerection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81045 \">table 4</a>). If the patient is in severe distress, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate may be increased. Hypotension may be present in the setting of volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea. Temperature is normal and, with the exception of severe cases, mental status is preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike opioid withdrawal, ethanol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal may produce seizures and hyperthermia. Ethanol, sedative-hypnotic, and opioid withdrawal can all present with a broad spectrum of severity and vital sign abnormalities, but the first two syndromes are much more likely to cause significant hypertension and tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If withdrawal was produced by an interruption in opioid use, symptoms can be managed with either opioids or with non-opioid adjuncts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54978 \">table 5</a>). We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> be given in this setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Twenty mg of orally administered methadone or 10 mg of intramuscular methadone are usually sufficient to relieve withdrawal symptoms without producing opioid intoxication. We use the intramuscular route, since the nauseated withdrawing patient may vomit after an oral dose. (See <a href=\"#H321658047\" class=\"local\">'Withdrawal from interruption in opioid use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In situations where the use of opioids (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) is undesirable, nonopioid adjuncts may be used to manage symptoms. Examples of such situations include withdrawal triggered by an antagonist and withdrawal after intentionally stopping use of opioids to treat an addiction. In patients with normal or elevated blood pressure, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, the clinician can give clonidine 0.1 to 0.3 mg orally every hour until symptoms resolve to a maximum total daily dose of 0.7 mg. (See <a href=\"#H321658101\" class=\"local\">'Withdrawal due to opioid antagonist and other circumstances not amenable to treatment with opioid agonist'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although significant hypertension and tachycardia precipitated by a short-acting antagonist are expected to resolve after brief observation, hemodynamic instability induced by a long-acting drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a>) requires pharmacologic management. Patients who may require more intensive management include the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease. Benzodiazepines are a good supplement to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> therapy. In addition to clonidine, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, in 10 to 20 mg intravenous aliquots, given every 5 to 10 minutes until adequate sedation and hemodynamic stability are achieved. Treatment for other symptoms is described above. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed discussion of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome is found separately.
