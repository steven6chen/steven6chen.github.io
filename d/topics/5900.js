Notably, the vast majority of the ECG abnormalities were comprised of increased <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> wave voltages, suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy. Other major abnormalities, such as repolarization abnormalities and primarily negative T waves, were relatively rare and unrelated to cardiac dimensions. Regardless of the fact that negative T waves tend to normalize with exercise, this pattern should raise suspicion for underlying structural cardiac diseases, and these ECG abnormalities not uncommonly eventually have clinical or pathologic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2027761\"><span class=\"h2\">Training-related versus training-unrelated ECG changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more recent approach to the ECG reading was suggested in 2010 and subsequently refined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. For practical purposes, ECG changes in athletes can be separated into two groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83350 \">table 2</a>), depending on whether the ECG abnormality may likely be considered a result of chronic training or whether it occurs independently of training and most likely expression of a pathologic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Training-related ECG abnormalities occur commonly and are not associated with an increased risk of underlying cardiac disease and incidence of adverse events during exercise.

Training-unrelated ECG changes occur less frequently (&lt;5 percent). They convey an increased risk associated with exercise. </p><p/><p>Persons with training-unrelated ECG abnormalities should typically undergo additional cardiovascular testing and evaluation for clinically important cardiac pathology. However, there is a potential overlap between training-related versus training-unrelated ECG changes. In addition, in some athletes the distinction between an athlete's heart and a pathologic condition is difficult, and gray areas will exist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618639\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECG patterns suggestive of slowed AV nodal conduction (eg, first degree AV block and Mobitz type I second degree AV block) can result from increased vagal tone, which is normally seen as an adaptive response to certain types of athletic conditioning, particularly endurance training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102509 \">table 1</a>). No specific limitations are necessary in this setting as long as the athlete is asymptomatic and the conduction abnormalities improve (ie, disappear) with exertion. However, higher degrees of conduction abnormality will require attention prior to participation in athletics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">First degree AV block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First degree atrioventricular (AV) block, characterized by prolongation of the PR interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67882\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67882 \">waveform 1</a>), is commonly seen in athletes and has no important implications. Usually it is accompanied by resting sinus bradycardia. If the QRS complex is normal and the athlete has not had symptoms of syncope or presyncope, only a 12 lead ECG is necessary. If the QRS complex is abnormal or the athlete has had symptoms of syncope or presyncope, we recommend a noninvasive evaluation including an exercise stress test, echocardiogram, and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring because of the potential for underlying structural heart disease.

In general, Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second degree AV block has no important implications. However, in athletes with symptoms (eg, presyncope or syncope) possibly due to bradycardia, we recommend a noninvasive evaluation including an exercise stress test, echocardiogram, and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring because of the potential for underlying structural heart disease. Those symptomatic athletes who also have a bundle branch block may require electrophysiologic testing to establish the location of the Wenckebach block.

The evaluation and treatment of Mobitz II AV block is usually considered to be similar to those athletes with complete AV block. In the absence of a potentially reversible condition (eg, Lyme carditis), Mobitz II AV block should be treated with a pacemaker before permitting regular physical activity or sport activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Periodic follow-up is, however, suggested for all individuals with complete LBBB to ascertain a possible incidence of symptoms or evidence for cardiac disease.

Corrections for heart rates may be inaccurate at heart rates &le;40 beats per minute and &gt;120 beats per minute. Recording QTc intervals beyond the normal cut off values should raise the suspicion of either acquired or congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). The most frequent cause is the congenital long QT syndrome, which is a genetically-determined ion channel disease that may cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades-de-pointes and ventricular fibrillation.

Athletes with QTc intervals between 440 msec and 500 msec represent a &quot;grey zone&quot;, which requires detailed assessment to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Society guidelines regarding the management of athletes with prolonged QTc intervals are subtly different in the US and Europe:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Society of Cardiology states that unequivocal diagnosis of LQTS (regardless the specific gene abnormality responsible) is the basis for disqualification from competitive sports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American recommendations from the 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> Scientific statement are more liberal. Symptomatic LQTS athletes may participate in all sports if they have been asymptomatic on treatment for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Asymptomatic patients with baseline QT prolongation (QTc of 470 ms or more in males, 480 ms or more in females) are allowed to participate in class IA sports. The loosening of restrictions includes the undertaking of several appropriate measures, including presence of an AED and emergency action plans.</p><p/><p>Given that the activity level associated with class IA sports is nearly the same as routine daily living, we generally allow patients with a LQTS to participate in such activities and restrict high levels of activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25707298\"><span class=\"h2\">Short QT syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is an inheritable ion channel disease that is characterized by an abnormally short cardiac repolarization (as noted by short QT interval on surface ECG) predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Shortening of repolarization allows for short myocardial refractoriness, which predisposes to atrial or ventricular fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When an abnormally short QTc interval is identified in an athlete (QTc &lt;380 msec), causes of transient QT shortening (such as hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, acidosis and some drugs [eg, digitalis, anabolic steroids]), must be ruled out. In the absence of acquired causes of short QT interval, the athlete should be referred for familial ECG-clinical screening and molecular genetic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-qt-syndrome#H1561601171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>There is a lack of published literature regarding the risks of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes with SQTS. However, in the 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> Scientific statement, patients with SQTS may participate in all sports if they have been asymptomatic on treatment for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H982954947\"><span class=\"h2\">WPW syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular preexcitation (eg, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [WPW]) is identified on ECG by the presence of short PR interval and delta waves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The interest for WPW in athletes is due to the concern that patients with WPW may develop arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden death as a result of rapid conduction over the AV accessory pathway. Exercise has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of developing AF. Therefore, sports activity may expose an athlete with ventricular preexcitation to an increased risk of sudden death.</p><p>The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that athletes with a diagnosis of ventricular preexcitation be evaluated by electrophysiologic study for the inducibility of AV reentrant tachycardia and refractoriness of the accessory pathway (shortest preexcited RR interval at rest and during exercise or adrenergic drug stimulation), as this may influence eligibility for athletic competition, risk stratification, and therapy, including catheter ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Possible exceptions are athletes with intermittent loss or sudden disappearance during exercise of the WPW pattern, which suggests a long anterograde refractory period of the accessory pathway, responsible for slow ventricular response during atrial fibrillation and a low risk of sudden death. The 2015 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> Scientific Statement is similarly more aggressive than in the past, in that asymptomatic athletes with WPW should undergo risk stratification with an exercise stress test and then an electrophysiology (EP) study if low risk cannot be assured by the stress test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiographic-abnormalities-and-conduction-disturbances-in-athletes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A reasonable approach, in our view, is to perform electrophysiologic studies in adolescents and young adults. However, for older adults who have been self selected to survive through adolescence and young adulthood, an invasive electrophysiologic study may not be mandated. Individual risks and benefits of an aggressive versus nonaggressive approach should be discussed with the athlete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618541\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A broad range of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities can be seen in trained athletes, particularly increased QRS voltage and repolarization abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102509 \">table 1</a>). In the original report of 1005 athletes, distinctly abnormal ECG patterns were found in 14 percent, mildly abnormal ECG patterns in 26 percent, and a normal ECG or minor alterations in 60 percent. When the same patients were evaluated with echocardiography, only 5 percent were found to have a structural abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A current approach for ECG assessment distinguishes the most common ECG abnormalities related to training, which are considered benign expressions of physiologic cardiac adaptation and do not require additional testing, from the uncommon ECG unrelated to training, which are possible expressions of underlying cardiac disease and mandate careful diagnostic investigation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83350\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83350 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2027761\" class=\"local\">'Training-related versus training-unrelated ECG changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG patterns suggestive of slowed AV nodal conduction (eg, first degree AV block and Mobitz type I second degree AV block) can result from physiologic increased vagal tone in well-conditioned athletes. In the absence of symptoms, neither first degree AV block nor Mobitz type I second degree AV block requires treatment or precludes participation in athletics. However, in athletes with symptoms (eg, presyncope or syncope) possibly due to bradycardia, we recommend a noninvasive evaluation including an exercise stress test, echocardiogram, and, in some patients, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring because of the potential for underlying structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'First degree AV block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Second degree AV block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type II second degree AV block and acquired complete AV block are uncommon in athletes. In the absence of a potentially reversible condition (eg, Lyme carditis), these conduction abnormalities should be treated with a pacemaker before permitting any athletic or sport activity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Second degree AV block: Mobitz type II'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acquired complete AV block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital complete AV block is due to an interruption of conduction between the atrium and AV node, often occurring in the absence of other structural cardiac abnormalities. Athletes with congenital heart block, a structurally normal heart and normal cardiac function, a narrow QRS complex, ventricular rates at rest &gt;40 to 50 beats per minute increasing appropriately with exertion, no history of syncope or near syncope, and no ventricular tachycardia (VT) during exertion can participate in competitive sports according to current recommendations. In contrast, athletes with congenital complete AV block and ventricular arrhythmia, symptoms of fatigue, near-syncope, or syncope should have a pacemaker implanted before they participate in competitive sports. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Congenital complete AV block'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletes with asymptomatic RBBB or LBBB and no ventricular arrhythmias who do not develop AV block with exercise can participate in all competitive sports consistent with their cardiac status. Periodic follow-up is suggested for all individuals with complete LBBB participating in competitive sport. There is no expert consensus or guideline recommendations regarding the frequency of follow-up, but we feel that, in the absence of symptoms, one annual follow-up with repeat ECG and echocardiography is appropriate, with additional follow-up after one year to generally be determined by the development of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Complete right or left bundle branch block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athletes with pacemakers and ICDs should not participate in competitive sports when the danger of bodily collision exists because such trauma may damage the pacemaker system. (See <a href=\"#H174699\" class=\"local\">'Athletes with pacemakers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of conditions (eg, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, WPW syndrome) are associated with ECG abnormalities and an increased risk of arrhythmias and SCD during or after exercise. As a general rule, most patients with one of these conditions should be restricted from competitive athletics or vigorous activity. However, there are some data that selected patients with Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), and short QT may participate in competitive sports.
