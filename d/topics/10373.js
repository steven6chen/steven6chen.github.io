Appropriate management requires an evaluation for secondary etiologies, such as systemic disorders and drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70425%7EGAST%2F62307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70425 graphicRef62307 \">table 1A-B</a>). Once secondary causes have been eliminated, idiopathic constipation may be associated with normal or slow colonic transit, defecatory dysfunction (pelvic floor dysfunction), or both.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the management of idiopathic chronic constipation. The etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation, as well as the management of constipation related to chronic opiates, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H188292857\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to a patient with chronic constipation will depend on whether studies indicate normal or slowed colonic transit and whether there is a defecatory dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88130\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88130 \">algorithm 1</a>). The specific choice of agents and order of their introduction varies with the etiology of the condition.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of chronic constipation includes patient education, behavior modification, dietary changes, and laxative therapy. Severe, intractable, slow transit constipation is rare and may be treated with surgery, but with extreme caution; patients should be referred to specialized centers for a full evaluation prior to surgery. Treatment for normal or slow transit constipation is shown in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88131\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88131 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of defecatory dysfunction involves suppositories, biofeedback, or botulinum toxin injections into the puborectalis muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88134\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88134 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Patients with both slow transit and defecatory dysfunction should be reevaluated after treatment of the defecatory dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890932\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of idiopathic chronic constipation includes patient education, dietary changes, bulk-forming laxatives, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of non-bulk-forming laxatives or enemas. Efficacy, safety, convenience, costs, and clinical response all weigh into the choice of the initial treatment selected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890939\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education involves efforts to reduce dependency on laxatives by emphasizing that daily bowel movements are not the norm or necessary for health, and to increase fluid and fiber intake. Patients who overuse laxatives should be advised to try to taper their use, as they introduce new measures to improve bowel function. Patients should be advised to try to defecate after meals, thereby taking advantage of normal postprandial increases in colonic motility. This is particularly important in the morning when colonic motor activity is highest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890946\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary changes and bulk-forming laxatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary fiber and bulk-forming laxatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> are the most physiologic and effective approach to therapy. Taken together with adequate fluids, this can improve bowel habits in many patients with constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Prunes were also shown to be effective in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The crossover trial included 40 patients with chronic constipation who were assigned to receive either prunes or psyllium daily for three weeks followed by a one week washout period prior to switching to the other treatment. Patients reported more complete spontaneous bowel movements while receiving prunes compared with psyllium (mean 3.5 versus 2.8 per week). In addition, patients reported improved stool consistency with prunes. There were no differences in straining and global constipation symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890953\"><span class=\"h3\">Fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiber supplementation can improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Fiber is available in a large variety of supplements and natural foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82094 \">table 2</a>). Because fiber supplements are low cost, easy to use, and safe, they are frequently used first in the management of constipation. Cereal fibers generally possess cell walls that resist digestion and retain water within their cellular structures. Fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulates the growth of colonic flora, thereby increasing fecal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Wheat bran is one of the more effective fiber laxatives, but may aggravate bloating and abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>There is a dose response between fiber intake, water intake, and fecal output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Larger particle size of the fiber source, such as the large particle size of cereal products, enhances fecal bulking effects. In addition to fiber, sugar components (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> and fructose) of foods such as apples, peaches, pears, cherries, raisins, grapes, and nuts are also beneficial.</p><p>The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 20 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. In addition to consuming foods with high fiber, patients may add raw bran (two to six tablespoons with each meal) followed by a glass of water or another beverage to achieve the fiber intake goal.</p><p>For some patients (and especially almost all those with slow transit constipation), fiber increases bloating and distention, leading to poor compliance (estimated to be as low as 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients should be warned that consuming large amounts of fiber can cause abdominal bloating or flatulence; this can be modulated by starting with small amounts and slowly increasing fiber intake according to tolerance and efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890960\"><span class=\"h3\">Bulk-forming laxatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bulk-forming laxatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> seed (eg, Metamucil), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> (eg, Citrucel), calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polycarbophil</a> (eg, FiberCon), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wheat-dextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">wheat dextrin</a> (eg, Benefiber) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 3</a>). They are natural or synthetic polysaccharides or cellulose derivatives that primarily exert their laxative effect by absorbing water and increasing fecal mass. These laxatives are effective in increasing the frequency and softening the consistency of stool with a minimum of adverse effects. They may be used alone or in combination with an increase in dietary fiber. </p><p>Despite substantial anecdotal clinical experience indicating benefit for bulk-forming laxatives, objective evidence regarding the effectiveness is inconsistent. A systematic review found evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> increases stool frequency in patients with chronic constipation, but found insufficient evidence for other forms of fiber including calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polycarbophil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>, and bran [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890967\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laxatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who respond poorly to fiber, or who do not tolerate it, may require laxatives other than bulk-forming agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 3</a>). There are few data comparing various non-bulk-forming laxative options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of side effects from these agents is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. Thus, the choice among them is based upon costs, ease of use, patient preference, and results of response to empiric treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802253998\"><span class=\"h3\">Surfactants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence to support the use of surfactant agents in chronic constipation. Stool softeners such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> sodium (eg, Colace) are intended to lower the surface tension of stool, thereby allowing water to more easily enter the stool. Although these agents have few side effects, they are less effective than other laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A systematic review concluded that stool softeners may be inferior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> for improvement in stool frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6451384\"><span class=\"h3\">Osmotic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyethylene glycol (PEG), poorly absorbed or nonabsorbable sugars, and saline laxatives cause intestinal water secretion and thereby increase stool frequency. Excessive use of these agents may result in electrolyte and volume overload in patients with renal and cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PEG &ndash; PEG electrolyte solutions (eg, GoLYTELY) and powdered preparations (eg, MiraLAX) that do not contain electrolytes are available for the treatment of chronic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A systematic review found evidence that polyethylene glycol is effective in improving stool frequency and consistency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A reasonable approach is to start with 17 g of powder dissolved in 8 oz of water once daily and titrate up or down (to a maximum of 34 g daily) to effect. There is no need to use PEG more than once daily. If patients do not respond, one can decrease PEG to 8.5 to 17 g daily and add a stimulant laxative every other to every third day as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic disaccharides &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactulose</a> (eg, Enulose) is a synthetic disaccharide. It is not metabolized by intestinal enzymes; thus, water and electrolytes remain within the intestinal lumen due to the osmotic effect of the undigested sugar. Lactulose requires some time (24 to 48 hours) to achieve its effect. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sorbitol</a> is an equally effective and a less expensive alternative. A systematic review found evidence that lactulose is effective in improving stool frequency and consistency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both lactulose and sorbitol may cause abdominal bloating and flatulence. PEG, however, is superior to lactulose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline &ndash; Saline laxatives such as milk of magnesia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a>, or water containing high amounts of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> are poorly absorbed and act as hyperosmolar solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hypermagnesemia, seen primarily in patients with renal failure, is the major complication.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6451393\"><span class=\"h3\">Stimulant laxatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulant laxatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> (eg, some forms of Dulcolax), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a> (eg, Senokot), and sodium picosulfate (eg, Dulcolax drops) primarily exert their effects via alteration of electrolyte transport by the intestinal mucosa. They also increase intestinal motor activity. A randomized four-week trial of sodium picosulfate (10 mg daily) in 45 patients with chronic constipation demonstrated improved bowel function for those receiving medication compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>A second randomized trial looked at the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this trial 368 patients were assigned to receive either bisacodyl (10 mg daily) or placebo for four weeks. At baseline, patients in both groups reported having a mean of 1.1 complete spontaneous bowel movements per week. At the end of treatment, patients in the bisacodyl group had significantly more complete spontaneous bowel movements per week compared with the placebo group (5.2 versus 1.9). Bisacodyl was also superior to placebo with regard to quality of life scores. Overall, bisacodyl was well tolerated, although diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in the bisacodyl group compared with the placebo group (53 versus 2 percent and 25 versus 3 percent, respectively).</p><p>Continuous daily ingestion of these agents may be associated with hypokalemia, protein-losing enteropathy, and salt overload. Thus, these drugs should be used with caution if taken chronically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There is no convincing evidence that chronic use of stimulant laxatives causes structural or functional impairment of the colon, nor does it increase the risk for colorectal cancer or other tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890974\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE CONSTIPATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe constipation have generally failed the above measures and require a different approach to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1968261206\"><span class=\"h2\">Suppositories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For treatment of defecatory dysfunction, we favor an initial trial of suppositories (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a>) since suppositories can be effective in liquifying stool and thereby overcoming obstructive defecation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890981\"><span class=\"h2\">Disimpaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a fecal impaction (a solid immobile bulk of stool in the rectum) should initially be disimpacted starting with manual fragmentation if necessary. After this is accomplished, an enema with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> will help to soften the stool and provide lubrication.</p><p>If disimpaction is unsuccessful or only partially successful, we order a water-soluble contrast enema (Gastrografin or Hypaque) administered under fluoroscopy to assure absence of any obstruction and to eliminate more proximal impactions. Occasionally, fractionation of impacted stool beyond the reach of the finger must be accomplished using flexible or rigid sigmoidoscopy with instrumentation. The colon must then be thoroughly evacuated. This can be accomplished with daily warm water enemas for up to three days, or by drinking a balanced electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) until cleansing is complete. We prefer warm water enemas (three to six ounces) in older adults because of the potential dangers of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> enemas in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This was demonstrated in a retrospective series in which the use of sodium phosphate enemas in older adults (mean age 80 years, all but one of age 70 years or older) was associated with complications including hypotension and volume depletion, hyperphosphatemia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, severe hypocalcemia, renal failure, and electrocardiogram changes (prolonged QT interval) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The patient is instructed to use the bathroom after meals to take advantage of meal-stimulated increases in colonic motility. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bisacodyl</a> or glycerine suppository is administered if there is no defecation after two days to prevent recurrence of fecal impaction. Alternatively, enemas may be administered.

Treatment failures have been attributed to patient and family noncompliance; underlying disturbances of bowel function may also have a role.</p><p>A modified program may be used in demented or bedridden patients with fecal impaction. After disimpaction and bowel cleansing with enemas or PEG-containing solutions, a fiber-restricted diet together with cleansing enemas once or twice per week will assist nursing management by decreasing the buildup of stool and recurrence of fecal impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30890988\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Habit training has been used successfully in children with severe constipation.

Its approval was based upon two placebo-controlled trials that included a total of 479 patients with chronic idiopathic constipation who were randomly assigned to active treatment (either 24 or 48 mcg daily) or placebo for four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Significantly more patients receiving active treatment achieved the primary endpoint (an increase in spontaneous bowel movements to at least three per week) during each week of observation. Corresponding improvement was observed for abdominal bloating, discomfort, stool frequency, and straining.</p><p>Three subsequent open-label trials involving a total of 871 patients showed persistent improvement compared with baseline in abdominal bloating, discomfort, and constipation for 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most common side effect was nausea, which occurred in approximately 30 percent of patients (compared with 5 percent in placebo). The incidence of nausea was dose-dependent and was lower with the 24 mcg dose (17 percent). In addition, diarrhea was reported in 13 percent of patients (compared with 1 percent for placebo). The approved dose is 24 mcg taken twice daily with food, which is believed to decrease the frequency of nausea.</p><p>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a> in the treatment of chronic constipation remains to be determined. There have been no comparisons with other options for treatment of severe constipation, and its long-term safety is not yet established. Until further data are available (and because it is expensive compared with other options and induces nausea), it is best reserved for patients with severe constipation in whom other approaches have been unsuccessful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30891016\"><span class=\"h3\">Misoprostol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> is a prostaglandin analog which has been used successfully to treat some patients with severe constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Anecdotal experience suggests that misoprostol (200 mcg daily or every other day and increased by 200 mcg daily to every other day at weekly intervals as tolerated to efficacy) can be effective when used with PEG (without electrolytes) in doses ranging from 17 to 34 g daily.
