Two related isoforms of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme have been described, COX-1 and COX-2. Some NSAIDs have a greater inhibitory effect on COX-1 and others on COX-2. COX-1 inhibition is the stimulus for acute reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASA)/NSAIDs</span> in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).</p><p>In this topic review, the term &quot;NSAID&quot; includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (ASA).

The term &quot;AERD&quot; places emphasis on the chronic upper and lower respiratory disease as the fundamental disorder and a reaction to NSAIDs as an exacerbating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Pseudoallergic reactions are triggered by a wide range of structurally distinct medications that have in common the ability to inhibit the COX-1 enzyme. These reactions represent an abnormal biochemical response to the pharmacologic actions of NSAIDs. In contrast, IgE-mediated &quot;allergic&quot; reactions result from the formation of antibodies against a specific drug, haptenated drug, or a group of structurally similar drugs.</p><p>Reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in patients with AERD are characterized as type 1 pseudoallergic reactions.

Among patients with severe asthma, the prevalence is twice as high, at approximately 14 percent. Among patients with nasal polyposis or chronic rhinosinusitis, the prevalence is about 10 and 9 percent, respectively.</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sensitivity is particularly prevalent in patients with <strong>both</strong> chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyposis, and some patients may not be aware that they are sensitive to these medications. In a prospective study of 80 adults presenting consecutively to an allergy and immunology clinic with CRS and nasal polyps, 36 percent reported sensitivity to NSAIDs, but 49 percent reacted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> upon challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is not fully understood. There appears to be a dysregulation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, particularly with an overproduction of leukotrienes, which may result from decreased inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway of AA metabolism by the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). The overproduction of leukotrienes is further exacerbated by the action of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors (which block production of PGE<sub>2</sub>). In addition, patients with AERD may have decreased elaboration of downregulatory fatty acid products, such as lipoxins. Collectively, these abnormalities result in an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. AA metabolism, the role of mast cells, and other identified abnormalities in patients with AERD are reviewed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal arachidonic acid metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA is derived from the membrane phospholipids of many cell types and is metabolized along different pathways to yield various lipid mediators. Some of these mediators are proinflammatory and some are anti-inflammatory. A few can act in both capacities, depending upon the target cell. A simplified overview of AA metabolism is provided here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">5-lipoxygenase pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolism of AA by the enzyme 5-LO generates the leukotrienes (LTs), as depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50924 \">figure 1</a>). The cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub>, and LTE<sub>4</sub>, are potent inducers of bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, nasal mucosal swelling, and airway edema, and also attract eosinophils into the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These are the major LTs synthesized by eosinophils and mast cells, cell types that are abundant in inflamed airways.</p><p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (a non-cysLT) is also proinflammatory, but with effects on neutrophils and monocytes. Yet another 5-LO product, 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), is a very potent eosinophil chemoattractant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50924 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclooxygenase pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolism of AA by the two cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2, also known as cycloendoperoxidase H synthases or prostaglandin synthases) yields prostaglandins and thromboxanes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76922 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One of the prostaglandins, prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>), is predominantly produced by mast cells and has a bronchoconstrictor effect. It appears to be overproduced at baseline in AERD and further increased after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Production of PGD<sub>2</sub> and its metabolite, PGD<sub>2</sub>S, is relatively aspirin resistant and may be more dependent upon COX-2 than COX-1. In contrast, PGE<sub>2</sub> is a bronchodilator with potent anti-inflammatory effects. It is expressed in a broad range of cells and is decreased after COX-1 inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. PGE<sub>2</sub> is believed to act as a &quot;brake&quot; on the production of the proinflammatory LTs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormalities in AERD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of AERD patients demonstrate a baseline dysregulation of AA metabolism with greatly increased production of the proinflammatory and underproduction of the anti-inflammatory products compared with non-AERD asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The proinflammatory leukotrienes promote persistent airway inflammation. The baseline dysregulation is acutely exaggerated by ingestion of COX-1 inhibitors, perhaps because the synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> is reduced and the &quot;brake&quot; on leukotrienes is released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. While mast cells have traditionally been thought to be the major source of cysLTs, accumulating evidence suggests that platelets may play a role in this process by providing the enzymes needed for leukocytes to produce leukotrienes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The following abnormalities, which support this model of AERD pathophysiology, have been identified in patients with AERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/25-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary cellular source of leukotriene LTC<sub>4</sub> in patients with AERD appears to be the bronchial mast cell, although eosinophils are also capable of producing large amounts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

When closely associated, platelets and leukocytes can share metabolic processes (ie, transcellular synthesis) to produce enhanced amounts of proinflammatory leukotrienes.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is believed to act as a brake on leukotriene production, as mentioned previously. The inhalation of PGE<sub>2</sub> has been shown to prevent the reaction to inhaled forms of acetylsalicylic acid (ie, lysine-aspirin), as well as the rise in cysLTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], suggesting that altered PGE<sub>2</sub> homeostasis may be key to this disorder. PGE<sub>2</sub> suppresses leukotriene production through the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), and PKA activity was shown to be abnormally low in granulocytes in the blood of patients with AERD, compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Additionally, several isoforms of the PGE receptors are reduced on the inflammatory cells in nasal polyp and bronchial tissues of AERD patients, further suggesting that altered PGE homeostasis may contribute to AERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/20,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional evidence of a role for PGE<sub>2</sub> in AERD comes from laboratory studies.

A small case control study examined changes in expression of plasma proteins in six aspirin-sensitive and six aspirin-tolerant asthmatics at baseline and after aspirin challenge, compared with control patients without asthma. Baseline differences were detected in complement proteins, apolipoproteins, and albumin complexed with myristic acid, with significant up- and downregulation of these proteins after aspirin challenge. In particular, patients with AERD had higher levels of C3a and C4a than tolerant patients at baseline, with levels that correlated to changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) during challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347427262\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) typically have chronic asthma and rhinosinusitis and experience acute exacerbations of upper and lower respiratory symptoms after the ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a survey of 190 patients, the majority reported that AERD adversely affected their quality of life and identified chronic nasal symptoms and decreased sense of smell as important factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347427867\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal development of symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AERD is usually diagnosed in adulthood.

This is followed by the development of chronic hypertrophic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis, characterized by nasal congestion, anosmia, and nasal polyposis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73419 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50105 \">picture 2</a>). Some patients report repeated sinus surgeries and polypectomies. On computed tomography (CT), mucosal thickening typically affects most, if not all, of the paranasal sinuses, and polyps may appear as rounded mucosal protrusions in the nasal or sinus cavities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As the rhinosinusitis worsens, the patient typically develops inflammation in the lower airway and is diagnosed with asthma.

The pain was retrosternal, heavy, or squeezing in nature and radiated into the jaw, neck, or arms, with accompanying diaphoresis, nausea, or lightheadedness.

Of the 10 patients, 8 had initiated high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy after undergoing an aspirin desensitization, and 6 of those patients reported that the chest pain began or worsened while they were on high-dose aspirin. Patients who underwent cardiac catheterization either had normal coronary arteries (without significant atherosclerosis) or showed evidence of coronary vasospasm. A course of glucocorticoids resulted in improvement or resolution in several patients. Until more is known about this entity, clinicians should be aware that patients with AERD may have angina-like chest pain in association with peripheral blood eosinophilia if no other cause can be identified. It has been speculated that the vasospasm may be related to eosinophils as indicated by the case report of resolution with steroid therapy, although further study is needed.

(See <a href=\"#H347427262\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.) </p><p>A clinical diagnosis may be more difficult in patients with isolated asthma or isolated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis. In this case, a careful clinical history of symptoms following NSAID ingestion is required, possibly followed by diagnostic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p>The differentiation of pseudoallergic reactions, such as AERD, from allergic reactions to an individual NSAID is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical diagnosis of NSAID reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When trying to determine whether a patient with asthma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal polyposis has had an adverse reaction to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is helpful to describe the symptoms of pseudoallergic reactions, as patients may not have previously recognized the association. NSAID sensitivity is an acquired condition, and the symptoms following NSAID ingestion are similar to flares in the underlying asthma and rhinosinusitis, so patients who were accustomed to taking these medications without difficulty often do not recognize the connection for some time. Clarifying the association with NSAID ingestion can be complicated, as the reason for NSAID ingestion, such as a respiratory infection or menstruation, may itself be a potential asthma trigger.</p><p>Some patients may not report NSAID-associated symptoms, as they have empirically avoided <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and NSAIDs for many years. Studies in which NSAID intolerance was diagnosed by challenge have reported higher rates among the general asthmatic population compared with those that rely on history alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thus, the absence of a history of a reaction does not exclude NSAID sensitivity.</p><p>A small number of patients with NSAID intolerance may not recognize it because they are taking low daily doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> without obvious symptoms. This was observed in 7 patients in a series of 163 patients with AERD at one referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Patients were taking 81 mg of aspirin daily. After stopping aspirin for at least 10 days, these patients had typical reactions to aspirin upon challenge, although with smaller decreases in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) compared to other AERD patients. Four were subsequently desensitized to aspirin and responded to higher-dose therapy with improvements in nasal and asthma symptoms. Thus, the ability to tolerate low-dose aspirin therapy does not exclude the possibility of NSAID intolerance.</p><p>If the clinical history suggests a reaction to an NSAID, the clinician should then attempt to determine if the patient has reacted to more than one cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting NSAID, to exclude the possibility of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction to a single NSAID. The patient should be questioned about any NSAID use SUBSEQUENT TO the first recognized reaction. NSAID ingestions BEFORE the first reaction are not relevant, since NSAID sensitivity is acquired, as reviewed previously. However, there is no evidence that previous NSAID use is required in order to develop NSAID sensitivity. Among patients with asthma and significant rhinosinusitis after a careful history, there is an 80 percent likelihood of having a positive oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge with a history of a single NSAID reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This increases to 90 percent with a history of reactions to two different NSAIDs.</p><p>Cutaneous symptoms to NSAIDs usually signify a different type of NSAID reaction (eg, NSAID-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema)</span>. However, occasional patients with AERD have blended reactions (mixed respiratory and cutaneous). Thus, the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> does not exclude the possibility of AERD.

AERD affects 5 to 20 percent of all patients with asthma. Reactions to NSAIDs typically begin 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion and present as a sudden worsening of asthma and nasal congestion, sometimes accompanied by other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H347427262\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of AERD involves acquired perturbations in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and a resulting imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, leading to chronic airway inflammation. The pharmacologic action of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting NSAIDs acutely exacerbates this imbalance, and also results in mast cell activation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A working diagnosis of AERD is usually made clinically based upon the presence of the characteristic component disorders (ie, asthma, CRS with nasal polyposis, and a history of NSAID reactions).
