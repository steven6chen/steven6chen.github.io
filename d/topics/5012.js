It can lead to vision loss and even blindness.</p><p>The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84036\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef84036 \">picture 1</a>). It sends nerve signals to the brain about what we see. If the retina gets a tear or hole, it can start to peel off the back of the eye. If this happens, the person can lose the ability to see.</p><p>A detached retina most often happens for no clear reason. But having diabetes or getting an eye injury can raise the risk of a detached retina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28271047\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a detached retina?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing dark or floating spots (doctors call these &quot;floaters&quot;). These can look like:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A spiderweb</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A large spot that comes and goes &ndash; It might look like a big fly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many small black spots</p><p/><p>Small floaters are very common. They usually don't mean there is an eye problem. But when they happen suddenly and are very large, they can be a sign of a problem.</p><p>Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing flashes of light &ndash; The flashes might be easier to see at night or in a dark room.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing vision &ndash; A person might not be able to see detail, or only see shapes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28271062\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse right away if you suddenly lose vision or see flashes of light, large floaters, or many floaters. These could be warning signs of a detached retina.</p><p>Seeing floaters and flashes of light can also be a sign of a condition called &quot;posterior vitreous detachment.&quot; This condition is fairly common. It is not as serious as a detached retina. But people who get a posterior vitreous detachment need to see a doctor on a regular basis to make sure it does not become a detached retina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28271076\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for detached retina?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for a detached retina, your doctor can do an eye exam and test your vision.</p><p>If the doctor thinks you might have a detached retina, you will need to see an eye doctor. The eye doctor will do a procedure called a &quot;dilated eye exam.&quot; This means the doctor gives you eye drops that help him or her see inside your eye. Then the doctor looks at your retina to see if it is detached. He or she will use some special devices or lights that help him or her see the retina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28271091\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a detached retina treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the retina is detached, doctors treat it right away. This can help keep it from getting worse and causing blindness. Doctors can treat a detached retina by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injecting a bubble of gas into the eye &ndash; This can push the retina back into place.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing surgery &ndash; Doctors use different methods to put the detached retina back and hold it in place.</p><p/></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
