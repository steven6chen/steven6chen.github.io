Red blood cells are made in the center of your bones, in a part called the bone marrow. They are the cells in the blood that carry oxygen. Normally, red blood cells carry oxygen to all of the organs in the body.</p><p>In thalassemia, the body does not make enough red blood cells. When a person has too few red blood cells, it's called &quot;anemia.&quot;</p><p>Thalassemia is a life-long condition that people are born with. It is caused by an abnormal gene. There are many different types of thalassemia, depending on which gene is affected and how severe the anemia is. Beta thalassemia major is one serious form.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196151\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of beta thalassemia major?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually start after a baby is a few months old. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting cranky or upset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not growing as much as expected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin or white part of the eyes turning yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bones of the face or skull being wider than normal</p><p/><p>Some of the symptoms happen because parts of the body that don't normally make red blood cells start trying to make them. This is why some people notice swelling or abnormal growth of certain organs or bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196166\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for thalassemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A blood test can show if someone has thalassemia, and what type they have. Some people also get a blood test to check for a thalassemia gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196181\"><span class=\"h1\">How is beta thalassemia major treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with beta thalassemia major and other types of thalassemia that involve severe anemia are treated with blood transfusions. A blood transfusion is when a person gets blood that was given (donated) by another person.</p><p>Although blood transfusions help treat thalassemia, they can also cause problems. That's because blood has iron in it. When people get a lot of blood transfusions, their body gets too much iron. Too much iron can damage the heart and liver.</p><p>People getting blood transfusions for their thalassemia need treatment to get rid of the extra iron that builds up in their bodies. Treatment to get rid of this extra iron is called &quot;iron chelation.&quot; Doctors can use different medicines for iron chelation.</p><p>Severe thalassemia can sometimes be cured with a procedure called a &quot;bone marrow transplant.&quot; This is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant.&quot; The procedure involves replacing the cells that cannot make enough red blood cells with healthy cells. These healthy cells come from another person (the donor). But not everyone with thalassemia can have this procedure. That's because it can be done only if a person and his or her donor meet certain conditions. The procedure is only done for people who have a severe form of thalassemia, since it can cause many side effects including death.</p><p>Some people with beta thalassemia major will need surgery to remove the spleen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196196\"><span class=\"h1\">What can people with thalassemia do to stay healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with all types of thalassemia should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See their doctor for regular follow-ups, and follow all instructions about tests and treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid taking vitamins or supplements with iron in them.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a vitamin called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> (folate), if the doctor or nurse recommends it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196211\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have a child with thalassemia and want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a child with thalassemia, it's possible that your future children will have thalassemia, too. Talk with your doctor to find out how likely it is that your future children will have the disease.</p><p>If you do get pregnant, you can choose to test your unborn baby for thalassemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15196226\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=splenectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Splenectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
