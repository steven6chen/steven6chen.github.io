The extrinsic muscles permit the larger force-generating muscles to be located away from the foot and to avoid interference with the intrinsic structure of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F54716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54716 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71142 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>The extrinsic muscles are organized into four fascial compartments that are anatomically important to compartment syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 9</a>). Each compartment has a nerve that may cause classic neurologic symptoms in the foot if the compartment pressure is elevated.

The peroneus longus inserts on the base of the first metatarsal bone and medial cuneiform bone and acts to evert the foot and weakly plantarflex it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93699 \">picture 1</a>). The peroneus brevis inserts on the base of the fifth metatarsal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93702\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93702 \">picture 2</a>) and has the same action as does the peroneus longus.</p><p>The superficial posterior compartment of the leg contains the sural nerve and the triceps surae (the gastrocnemius and soleus complex), which insert via the Achilles tendon into the posterior surface of the calcaneus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91480 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91479\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91479 \">picture 4</a>). They are the force generators that plantarflex the foot and weakly evert the heel.</p><p>The deep posterior compartment of the leg contains the tibial nerve and the tibialis posterior (TP), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), and flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscles. The tendinous portion of these muscles are located in the tarsal tunnel (with the posterior tibial artery, vein, and nerve) as they all pass inferior to the medial malleolus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TP inserts on the tuberosity of the navicular bone, along with additional insertion points on the three cuneiforms, and the base of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93703\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93703 \">picture 5</a>). It functions to plantarflex and invert the foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FDL inserts on the base of the distal phalanges of the lateral four digits and this flexes these four digits, plantarflexes the foot, and supports the longitudinal arch of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93704\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93704 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FHL inserts on the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe and is responsible for flexing the great toe at all joints, plantarflexing the foot, and supporting the longitudinal arch of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93705\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93705 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972237\"><span class=\"h2\">Arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arteries of the foot are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93192 \">figure 10</a>). The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery that crosses the anterior joint line of the ankle just deep to the extensor hallucis longus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As the artery proceeds down the long axis of the foot to the proximal first intermetatarsal space, it divides into a deep plantar artery and an arcuate artery that sends off branches to each of the toes.</p><p>The arteries in the sole of the foot are derived from the posterior tibial artery and form the medial and lateral plantar arteries. The lateral plantar branch sends off branches through the plantar arterial arch, which anastomoses with the deep plantar artery for the dorsalis pedis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972243\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common fibular (peroneal) and tibial nerves are the two major divisions of the sciatic nerve that branch just above the knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83190 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve is the nerve that is injured most often in the lower limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76717 \">figure 11</a>). Severance of this nerve causes a foot drop because of the paralysis of the dorsiflexion and eversion muscles of the foot.</p><p>The common fibular (peroneal) nerve splits into a superficial and deep branches just distal to the fibular head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The superficial branch provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the dorsum of the foot and innervates the fibular (peroneal)s (hindfoot evertors). The deep branch provides sensation to the interdigital space between the first and second toe and is responsible for dorsiflexing the ankle and toes. The tibial nerve proceeds posterior to the medial malleolus and becomes the medial and lateral plantar nerves. The tibial and fibular (peroneal) nerves give off branches that form the sural nerve, which supplies sensation to the lateral aspect of the ankle and foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1908344721\"><span class=\"h2\">Veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major veins of the lower leg and foot consist of the great saphenous vein, medal and lateral marginal veins of the foot, and the dorsal venous arch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73200\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73200 \">figure 12</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the structural divisions discussed above, the foot can be divided into two functional columns: medial and lateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The medial column, consisting of the calcaneus, talus, navicular, medial cuneiforms, and medial three toes, forms the medial longitudinal arch and is the main axis for weightbearing and propulsion. The lateral column, consisting of the calcaneus, cuboid, and lateral two toes, forms the lateral longitudinal arch and is the main axis for proprioception.</p><p>A review of the gait cycle is helpful in understanding the complex movements of the foot that occur during walking and running. The subtalar movement controls the locking and unlocking of the midtarsal joints and determines the actions of the forefoot. These coupled motions of the foot allow it to perform its various functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pronation, which provides maximum shock absorption, occurs when the tibia internally rotates, the talus adducts and plantarflexes, and the calcaneus everts. Supination, which converts the foot into a rigid lever, occurs when the tibia externally rotates, the talus abducts and dorsiflexes, and the calcaneus inverts.</p><p>The gait cycle has four phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53103\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103 \">figure 13</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heel-strike to foot-flat (contact)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot-flat to heel-off (midstance)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heel-off to toe-off (propulsion)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toe-off to heel-strike (swing)</p><p/><p>Detailed description of these phases is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foot-and-ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contact</strong> &ndash; In the contact phase, the lateral calcaneus strikes the ground. At the point of impact, the tibia internally rotates, causing the calcaneus to evert and talus to drop and adduct to unlock the midtarsal joints and provide maximum shock absorption. The foot is lowered eccentrically to the ground by the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior. In runners who contact the ground with their midfoot or forefoot, they will get into midstance quicker, pronate earlier, and load the Achilles more with less impact of the lower extremity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mid-stance</strong> &ndash; In the midstance phase, the cycle progresses from the flat-foot to the heel-off. As the rearfoot fully pronates, the metatarsals hit the ground to bring the foot flat on the ground. The body's center of gravity passes from behind to over the foot. During this phase, the subtalar joint resupinates (calcaneus everts and talus abducts) and locks the midtarsal joints, transforming the foot from a shock absorber to a rigid lever. The posterior tibialis is an important restraint to overpronation and is an active foot supinator. As the body passes over the mid-foot, it places the ankle in maximal dorsiflexion, putting a maximal preload on the gastrocnemius-soleus complex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Propulsion</strong> &ndash; In the propulsion phase, the heel-lift progresses to toe-off. As the heel rises, the body continues forward over the metatarsals and begins to pull the heel off the ground. The extension of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, especially the first MTP joint, result in the windlass effect of the plantar fascia that elevates the arch and further assists in the supination of the foot. The foot is now a rigid lever and is used to propel the body forward by maximal contraction of the gastrocnemius-soleus and hamstrings. At toe-off, the line of progression usually passes between the first and second metatarsal that are in maximal extension.

Important questions to ask include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of activity led to the injury? What was the mechanism of the injury? &ndash; Answers to these questions help identify the structures that are most likely to be injured. For example, excessive inversion of the ankle during basketball is associated with a lateral ankle ligament sprain, distal fibular avulsion fracture, or a fifth metatarsal fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can the patient bear weight? Can he or she ambulate? &ndash; Inability to bear weight or ambulate is associated with fractures, dislocations, or a major disruption of the ligaments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was there a mechanical sensation, such as a popping or cracking, at the time of the injury? &ndash; The presence of these sensations suggests an avulsion fracture or tendon tear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been a persistent feeling of instability in the foot or ankle since the injury occurred? &ndash; Instability of the foot or ankle suggests ligamentous laxity or tears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the location, radiation, intensity, and duration of pain? &ndash; Localization of pain helps to identify the anatomic region affected by the injury and helps to narrow the likely diagnoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What aggravates the pain? &ndash; In particular, the clinician should determine if the patient's pain is worse during certain portions of the gait (eg, heel strike or toe-off) or when completing certain maneuvers (eg, cutting to the side).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What factors alleviate the pain? &ndash; The amount and intensity of pain may be estimated based upon whether or not it responds readily to local measures (eg, cold therapy) or mild analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have numbness or tingling in the foot? &ndash; These sensations suggest nerve injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have weakness that may or may not be related to the pain? &ndash; Weakness suggests disruption of the tendons or nerves to the region.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic foot and ankle problems require the examiner to establish an accurate chronology and to identify specific activities that cause the pain.</p><p>For chronic problems, important questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the patient have an acute injury prior to developing chronic pain? &ndash; Chronic injuries and pain frequently arise from acute injuries that have not properly healed or been appropriately rehabilitated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What activity seems to worsen the problem? &ndash;Certain activities are associated with specific chronic injuries (eg, flexor hallucis longus tendinitis in classical ballet dancers or plantar fasciitis in distance runners).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often and for how long does the patient engage in the activity? Has there been a recent increase in the amount or duration of activity? &ndash; Overuse conditions of the foot and ankle frequently occur with heavy activity or a sudden change in activity (eg, practices at the beginning of a sports season).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is pain present during or after activity, or both? &ndash; Pain present during the activity indicates that the activity is beyond the body&rsquo;s structural ability. Pain only after the activity may indicate an inflammatory component to the injury instead of or in addition to a structural component to the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is pain present when the patient takes his or her first steps in the morning? &ndash; &quot;First step in the morning pain&quot; suggests plantar fasciitis. Early morning stiffness suggests a rheumatologic process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a problem with activities of daily living, such as ascending or descending stairs? &ndash; Impairment of normal activities of daily living suggests a significant underlying condition that warrants limitation of sports activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the problem only exacerbated by sports? &ndash; Problems evident only during sports activity suggest a specific stress caused by that sport on normal structures instead of a structural abnormality (eg, tarsal coalition) that predates sports participation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the above questions, if the patient is an athlete, he or she should be questioned about training. As an example, if the patient is a runner, the examiner should ask about weekly mileage, racing, speed workouts, and type of running surface. Runners should also be questioned about their running shoes (type, age, miles, and change in model) and the use of orthotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12350892\"><span class=\"h3\">Footwear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some shoes may be classically associated with specific foot problems as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcaneal apophysitis with cleats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morton neuroma with progress shoes that come to a point</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior tibialis tendinitis with pes planus with shoes lacking medial support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensor hallucis tendinitis with flip-flops</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Past history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Past medical history and a related review of systems also should be assessed. For chronic illnesses, ask what medications, physical therapy, home rehabilitation, or shoe or activity modifications have been tried.</p><p>Considering systemic medical illnesses or conditions that may affect the foot is also important. As an example, rheumatologic conditions may have early morning stiffness, involvement of multiple joints, back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hip pain and stiffness, skin rash, or positive family history.</p><p>Infectious causes, such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis, are frequently associated with fever, localized swelling, and erythema.

All of these may be a source of foot or toe pain. The patient should then be asked to stand with the feet three to four inches apart and to march in place for three to four steps. Once the patient has assumed the relaxed natural position, the clinician should evaluate the arch for the presence of pes planus (flat foot) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77874\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77874 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818 \">picture 13</a>) or cavus (high-arched foot) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817 \">picture 14</a>).

These observations are best made while standing behind the patient. As the patient rises on his or her toes, inversion of the heel indicates normal function of the posterior tibialis. In addition, the medial longitudinal arch should increase in height. Lack of elevation of the arch indicates a static pes planus that could be caused by tarsal coalition or injury to the subtalar joint.
