In addition, caretakers should be questioned regarding medications in the house. The patient's or caretaker's pharmacy may provide valuable information regarding prescribed medications, the date of the most recent refill, and the total number of pills dispensed.</p><p>Parents of intoxicated toddlers should be asked about ethanol-containing beverages or household products that may have been transferred from or left unsecured in their original containers. Common scenarios include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early-rising toddler who discovers and drinks abandoned alcoholic beverages the morning after a party</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The young child who drinks mouthwash in an attempt to imitate an adult's gargling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child who ingests a small amount of perfume or cologne</p><p/><p>Older intoxicated children and adolescents often binge drink in a social setting that is outside of adult supervision (eg, parties, rock concerts). Key concerns include coingestion or exposure to other drugs, coexistence of trauma (particularly head trauma), and sexual assault. Often, EMS reports regarding the patient's environment or state of undress can assist in identifying physical or sexual assault.</p><p>Children and adolescents with depression or other mental illness are at high risk for intoxication. In some instances, ethanol may be ingested as part of a suicide attempt. In these circumstances, further mental health evaluation is indicated after the child recovers from intoxication.</p><p>Ethanol poisoning in infants less than one year of age raises the concern of intentional ethanol administration or serious neglect by a caretaker because infants usually lack the developmental skills, such as mobility and dexterity, to self-administer ethanol. Thus, this finding warrants involvement of social services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Coingested sedative-hypnotic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, gamma hydroxybutyrate [GHB]) markedly increase the risk of deep coma with respiratory failure after ethanol ingestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to other sedative-hypnotics, ethanol intoxication commonly manifests as altered behavior, lethargy, coma, ataxia, slurred speech, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 3</a>). A characteristic sickly sweet breath odor is often prominent. Degree of lethargy is highly correlated with blood ethanol level in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64642 \">table 4</a>). Other important features include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures caused by hypoglycemia (especially infants and young children).

Detection of ethanol on the breath or in the serum provides additional confirmation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many causes of coma that deserve consideration when evaluating the patient with suspected ethanol intoxication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65571 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>Other than toxins, isolated or concomitant hypoglycemia or traumatic brain injury is the most likely cause of abrupt onset of lethargy of coma in children or adolescents. All children and adolescents with altered mental status should undergo measurement of rapid blood glucose and assessment for external signs of head trauma. In patients for whom traumatic brain injury is a strong possibility based upon clinical findings, computed tomography of the head may be warranted. Asymmetric structural lesions (eg, brain tumor, focal hemorrhage, or infection) are typically identified by focal findings on a careful neurologic examination followed by appropriate neuroimaging. Symmetrical structural lesions often have accompanying signs of increased intracranial pressure, especially headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-stupor-and-coma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of stupor and coma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Among toxic agents that may cause coma, other toxic alcohols (isopropyl alcohol, methanol), although chemically distinct, may mimic ethanol's toxic effects. Methanol and ethylene glycol, in particular, are important agents to consider since they have great toxic potential and frequently require antidotal therapy. They differ from ethanol in their delayed onset of toxic symptoms and inducement of profound metabolic acidosis. In addition, ethanol may mask coingestion of other toxic alcohols. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The combination of central nervous system depression and respiratory depression closely resembles the toxic syndrome seen with opioid intoxication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 3</a>). Many other sedative-hypnotic and psychoactive agents may also produce somnolence and respiratory depression and are often coingested with ethanol recreationally or with suicidal intent, especially in adolescents. Thus, even when serum or breath levels confirm ethanol ingestion, the possibility of sedative-hypnotic or opioid intoxication coingestion remains. An isolated ethanol overdose rarely causes profound respiratory depression requiring invasive airway management or cardiopulmonary instability. In such cases, the presence of coingestants should be investigated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> reverses the effects of opioid intoxication but will have no effect on central nervous system depression caused by ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic agents. However, naloxone may alleviate respiratory depression enough in patients with concomitant ethanol and opioid intoxication so that endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can be avoided. Patients who respond to naloxone warrant close monitoring of respiratory status and frequently require redosing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid intoxication in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Naloxone'</a>.)</p><p>Sedative-hypnotic intoxication is virtually indistinguishable clinically from ethanol intoxication. Rapid immunoassay screening of the urine can identify benzodiazepines and barbiturates, but a negative screen does not exclude exposure to benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Testing for benzodiazepine toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an illicit sedative-hypnotic that is often ingested recreationally at dance clubs and has also been implicated in date rape, can cause psychomotor agitation and profound coma of short duration (several hours). GHB is commonly coingested with ethanol and is not detected on rapid immunoassay urine toxicology screens, although it can be detected in the urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Effects from GHB are not reversed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a>. Thus, diagnosis of GHB intoxication is primarily made by history or characteristic clinical findings of agitation prior to, following, or in abrupt alternation with coma of short duration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Diabetic ketoacidosis may be mistaken for ethanol intoxication because of the presence of ketones on the breath. However, it is easily differentiated from ethanol poisoning by the typical history of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia in patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus or past medical history of diabetes mellitus in combination with laboratory findings of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Meningitis and encephalitis can also present with altered mental status but are usually accompanied by fever and other signs of infection that help distinguish these entities from ethanol intoxication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-encephalitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral encephalitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13779127\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid measurement of blood glucose should be performed in all patients, especially infants and young children, with altered mental status after ethanol ingestion.</p><p>If low, blood glucose should be corrected and then serially monitored, particularly in cases of younger children or others with limited glycogen stores who may be at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia. The specific clinical scenario, such as the time since ingestion and the age of the child, should determine the frequency of blood-glucose determinations, but these should be obtained until the patient demonstrates a pattern of stable blood sugars with normal oral glucose intake.

In adolescents with moderate to severe intoxication, who have only ingested ethanol, the level can help estimate duration of symptoms. In addition, degree of lethargy is highly correlated with blood ethanol level in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64642 \">table 4</a>).

Headspace gas chromatography may be used to measure blood or serum ethanol. An enzymatic oxidation method also exists to measure serum ethanol levels. Most hospital laboratories use serum to perform the &quot;blood&quot; ethanol test. The serum-to-blood ethanol ratio varies from 1.12 to 1.18 depending upon ethanol concentration in the blood specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum ethanol levels are routine chemistry studies in most hospitals and identify ethanol exposure in the infant, young child, and obtunded or otherwise uncooperative older patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath-alcohol meters rely on a relatively fixed partitioning (approximately 1 out of 2100) of ethanol between alveolar air and blood and provide an estimate of blood ethanol concentration at the bedside in the cooperative older child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].
