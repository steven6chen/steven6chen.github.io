The pathophysiology of chronic bladder pain is not well understood and it is likely that such symptoms represent more than one underlying etiology. Interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is a diagnosis that applies to patients with chronic bladder pain in the absence of other etiologies of the symptoms. Identification of patients who meet diagnostic criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> allows for treatment with the goal of providing symptomatic relief. This condition often coexists with other chronic pain syndromes (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome).</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> will be discussed here. Management of this condition is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4802765\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic bladder pain in the absence of an identifiable etiology has historically been called interstitial cystitis. This term is a misnomer, however, since there is no clear evidence that bladder inflammation (cystitis) is involved in the etiology or pathophysiology of the condition, nor is there evidence that the condition is associated with abnormalities of the interstices of the bladder.</p><p>The current understanding is that patients with these symptoms have a chronic pain condition of the bladder, analogous to other poorly understood chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. As such, there has been a movement to rename the condition painful bladder syndrome or bladder pain syndrome. However, considerable previous efforts have been devoted to recognizing &ldquo;interstitial cystitis&rdquo; as a legitimate, disabling medical condition and, therefore, the term has been retained in contemporary use to maintain continuity. This topic review uses the term &ldquo;interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome&rdquo; <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span>.</p><p>The definition of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is discussed below.

The most comprehensive study of this type is the RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology (RICE) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These investigators conducted a two-stage survey of approximately 150,000 United States households to identify and interview women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms. Using two validated <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> case definitions (high-sensitivity definition and high-specificity definition), they concluded that between 2.7 and 6.5 percent of United States women have symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>.</p><p/><p><span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is most commonly diagnosed in the fourth decade or later, but symptoms have been recognized in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> occurs approximately five times more commonly in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other risk factors are not well established. The few studies which have examined <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> prevalence patterns suggest that there are no large differences, but these data are very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A greater concordance of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> among monozygotic twin pairs than among dizygotic twin pairs suggests a genetic susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> often coexists with other chronic pain conditions (eg, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H318782\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28423492\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little known about the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span>. Ongoing and future research will likely demonstrate that patients currently grouped together under the umbrella diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> actually suffer from several different conditions with distinct etiologies.</p><p>It is accepted that any of several inciting factors may lead to the clinical manifestations of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> and several pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the clinical phenomena.</p><p>Surveys of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> suggest that certain foods and beverages, such as caffeine, alcoholic beverages, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and spicy foods, may worsen symptoms in some patients, although this is highly variable from patient to patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Studies in which patients underwent bladder biopsy have documented that patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> have urothelial abnormalities. Importantly, it is not known whether these urothelial abnormalities are secondary to another process that is not yet recognized.</p><p>Urothelial abnormalities in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> include: altered bladder epithelial expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II antigens, decreased expression of uroplakin and chondroitin sulfate, altered cytokeratin profile (towards a profile more typical of squamous cells), and altered integrity of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. A defect in Tamm-Horsfall protein has been found in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and P2X3 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptors is increased, and activation of the NFkB gene is enhanced.</p><p>The GAG layer of the bladder normally coats the urothelial surface and renders it impermeable to solutes, and, therefore, defects in this layer may allow urinary irritants to penetrate the urothelium and activate the underlying nerve and muscle tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This process may promote further tissue damage, pain, and hypersensitivity. Bladder mast cells may also play a role in the propagation of ongoing bladder damage after an initial insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Neurologic upregulation of pain sensation likely plays a role in <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. Central sensitization and increased activation of bladder sensory neurons during normal bladder filling may result in bladder pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This increased sensitivity may be present in the bladder itself or may be due to increased activity and new pathways within the central nervous system. Animal models suggest that hypersensitivity in bowel and other pelvic organs may be responsible for sensitization of the bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similar alterations in neural pathways may be responsible for the suprapubic tenderness that is present in <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It is also possible that the increase in visceral (bladder) sensitivity is secondary to a primary somatic injury that has sensitized central pathways that overlap with afferents from the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28423499\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is typically characterized by bladder discomfort, often associated with bladder filling, as well as pelvic tenderness on examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2089812\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, all patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> have persistent unpleasant sensations that are attributable to the bladder. The characteristics of these sensations are variable, but the most consistent feature is an increase in discomfort with bladder filling and a relief with voiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This symptom pattern is found in most, but not all, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. The distribution of symptoms at time of diagnosis is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56872 \">table 1</a>). The American Urological Association definition of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> requires that the duration of symptoms is at least six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H13715198\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The character of the unpleasant sensation varies among patients and across time in individual patients. Some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> complain of bladder pain, while others describe the sensations as &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; or &ldquo;discomfort.&rdquo; Some patients describe bladder spasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The character of symptoms may vary from one day to the next in a single patient. The severity of pain ranges from mild pressure to severe, debilitating pain.</p><p>The location of the pain or discomfort is usually described as being suprapubic or urethral, although patterns such as unilateral lower abdominal pain or low back pain with bladder filling are observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. Isolated urethral pain is uncommon; most patients cannot differentiate between urethral and bladder pain.</p><p>Regarding the onset of the symptoms, the majority of patients describe symptoms that are of gradual onset, with worsening of discomfort, urgency and frequency over a period of months. A smaller subset of patients describes symptoms that are abrupt and severe from their onset, with some patients able to name the exact date on which symptoms began.</p><p>Most patients cannot identify a triggering event, but some developed symptoms after an apparently uncomplicated urinary tract infection or surgical procedure, or after a trauma, such as a fall onto the coccyx. Exacerbation of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms may occur after intake of certain foods or drinks, during stress, after certain activities (eg, exercise, sexual intercourse, prolonged sitting), or during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/15,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34,35</a>].</p><p>Additional urinary symptoms, including urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, often accompany the discomfort or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A consistent feature of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is that the bothersome sensations are worsened by bladder filling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relieved by emptying. Thus, increased urinary frequency may arise because the pain of bladder filling is partially or completely relieved by voiding, so patients prefer to maintain low bladder volumes. <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is not commonly associated with urinary incontinence but is reported by some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>To further clarify the etiology of nonspecific urinary symptoms, it is useful to ask patients why they void frequently to help distinguish <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> from other causes of urinary frequency. As an example, patients with overactive bladder syndrome may void frequently to avoid urinary urgency incontinence, whereas with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> they void frequently to avoid discomfort. Patients with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> may void as many as 60 times per day, with associated disruption of daytime activities and sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients may describe sitting on a toilet for hours at a time in order to let urine dribble from their bladders more or less continuously so that bladders remain as empty as possible and pain is minimized.</p><p>Many patients experience disruption of home and work life due to chronic pain, urinary frequency, and fatigue, predictably resulting in some degree of worsening of quality of life. In surveys, 50 percent of patients reported being unable to work full-time, 75 percent described dyspareunia, 70 percent reported sleep disturbance, and 90 percent reported that <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> affected their daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Other chronic pain symptoms (eg, irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, fibromyalgia) are present in many patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. They may also describe exacerbation of their <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms during times when other pain symptoms are at their worst. Pain associated with these conditions should be differentiated from <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> pain, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-generalized-vulvodynia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of generalized vulvodynia&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H318782\"><span class=\"h2\">Coexisting conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> is often associated with other conditions, particularly chronic pain conditions (eg, vulvodynia, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia). A diagnosis of one of these conditions makes the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> more likely but at the same time makes it difficult, since bladder or perivesical pain is also a feature of some of these conditions.</p><p>Vulvodynia coexists with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> in many women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. As an example, one study of 122 women found that 80 percent of those with vulvodynia also had symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It is uncertain whether this represents referred pain between the bladder and vulva or a shared pathogenesis.</p><p>Sexual concerns and dysfunction are common in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/1,38,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,38,44,45</a>]. The association of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and sexual dysfunction may be complicated by the association of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> with vulvodynia and resultant dyspareunia, as well as bladder-specific symptoms during sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. As an example, a questionnaire study of 985 women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> who had sexual partners found that 88 percent reported a general sexual dysfunction symptom (eg, low libido, difficulty with arousal) and 90 percent reported a sexual symptom specifically associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> (eg, bladder pain during sex, urge to urinate during sex) within the past four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Observational studies suggest that some treatments which improve <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms may improve sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Other gynecologic conditions that have been found to be common in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> include dysmenorrhea and endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Similar to women with pelvic pain and men with chronic prostatitis, men with pelvic pain often have concomitant sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Many conditions associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> involve chronic pain or psychiatric illness. The frequency of conditions or history that are commonly found in men and women with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> was reported by a case-control study, including: gastritis (12-fold more likely in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> than controls); child abuse (ninefold); fibromyalgia (threefold); anxiety disorder (threefold); headache (threefold); esophageal reflux (twofold); unspecified back disorder (twofold); and depression (twofold) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/38,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,52-54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2089857\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variable tenderness of the abdominal wall, hip girdle, pelvic floor, bladder base, and urethra is almost universally present in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. This is likely due to sensitization of afferent nerve fibers in the dermomyotomes (thoracolumbar and sacral) to which the bladder refers. In males, scrotal and penile tenderness may be present. Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> may experience allodynia (perception of non-noxious stimuli, such as light touch, as being noxious or painful) as with other patients with chronic pain.</p><p>Many patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> exhibit tenderness or tightness of the pelvic floor muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. These abnormalities can be easily identified by palpation of the levator muscles on pelvic examination in women or on rectal examination in men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome#H12621847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome&quot;, section on 'Physical therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31167450\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patient will have an unremarkable urinalysis and sterile urine culture. Many patients will have had multiple negative urine cultures since their symptoms of dysuria and frequency often mimic bacterial cystitis. An occasional positive urine culture does not exclude a diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> since the risk of urinary tract infection is the same as in the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31166172\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the diagnostic evaluation for interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is to identify characteristic features and exclude other conditions (see <a href=\"#H13715206\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). The evaluation includes eliciting a history of symptoms and associated conditions, physical examination, and urine testing. <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> does not have any characteristic findings on imaging studies. Cystoscopy is not required to make the diagnosis but may be used for some patients to exclude other etiologies or identify bladder lesions associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31166218\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should elicit the characteristics of the pain or discomfort (eg, location, duration, relationship to bladder filling or emptying).</p><p>A voiding and fluid intake log can be helpful to document the frequent, low-volume voiding pattern that is characteristic of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and any relationship of fluid intake to symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69130 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Validated symptom scales have been developed to assess <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptom severity and to monitor clinical progress after diagnosis, but these are not helpful in distinguishing <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> from other conditions and are typically used only by specialists for a focused visit regarding <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> or for research. Two such scales are the IC Symptom and Problem Index and the Genitourinary Pain Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H13715206\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Urological Association guidelines use the following definition for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS:</span> &ldquo;An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Physical examination findings contribute to the clinical picture but are not necessary to make the diagnosis. Urinalysis, urine culture, and a postvoid residual are performed to exclude other etiologies. Cystoscopy is not required to make the diagnosis but may add information regarding the presence of intravesical findings consistent with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may be indicated to exclude other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H2089857\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31167125\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H319447\" class=\"local\">'Role of cystoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>The definition and diagnostic criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> have varied widely over the past few decades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66969 \">table 2</a>). It is likely that refinement of terminology will continue to occur as the understanding of this condition increases.</p><p>Before 2002, <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> was defined in research settings according to the criteria of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), using the so-called &ldquo;NIDDK criteria&rdquo; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66969 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Bladder pain with or without hematuria is a common presentation of bladder cancer. Urethral cancer is rare but may also present with urethral or bladder pain with or without hematuria. In addition, hematuria may be a sign of malignancy in other parts of the urinary tract. The absence of a mass on physical examination does not reliably exclude urinary tract cancer. Thus, all patients undergoing evaluation for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> who have hematuria and those without hematuria who have risk factors for bladder cancer should undergo evaluation with urine cytology and cystoscopy to exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genital tract cancers may also cause <span class=\"nowrap\">suprapubic/perivesical</span> pain, as well as other urinary symptoms due to the presence of a pelvic mass and pressure on or invasion into the bladder. Appropriate evaluation should be performed for gynecologic or prostate cancers, depending upon physical examination findings and risk factors.

In women, uterine leiomyomas are a common condition that may cause bladder pressure or pain. Physical examination findings consistent with a pelvic mass should be further evaluated.</p><p>Intravesical pathology may result in bladder pain or discomfort, such as a bladder stone or other foreign object. Risk factors for bladder stones include chronic bladder catheterization, ureteral stents, renal transplantation, and some medications (eg, fluoroquinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

Patients with this condition typically have postvoid dribbling of urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-diverticulum-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral diverticulum in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction or neurologic dysfunction may experience bladder pain.

Fever is not part of the symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> and patients with fever should be evaluated for an infectious etiology of their symptoms. Fever is also absent in most patients with cystitis and urethritis, and patients with chronic urinary tract infection or urethritis may have chronic intermittent symptoms that mimic <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. Urinalysis and culture should be performed to exclude bacterial cystitis. Chlamydial or gonococcal urethritis may be suspected in patients at risk of sexual transmitted diseases, and urine testing or urethral culture should be performed.

Increased numbers of mast cells are not associated with a visual finding, but may be found on biopsy. For hydrodistention, patients are placed under anesthesia and the bladder is filled with water or saline until 70 to 80 cm of water pressure is reached, usually at a bladder volume that is far greater than an awake patient can tolerate. This bladder dilation is maintained for several minutes; then the dilating fluid is released and the bladder is refilled. During this second bladder fill, the bladder epithelium is examined cystoscopically for characteristic findings of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> and biopsies are performed at these sites.</p><p>In some regions of the world, and historically in the United States, cystoscopy with bladder biopsy and hydrodistention are part of the routine evaluation of patients with suspected <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. The cystoscopic findings are used to classify patients into subgroups based upon the presence or absence of intravesical findings associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. There is no evidence that subclassification of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> patients in this manner provides meaningful information about prognosis or treatment response. Data suggest that some of the findings on biopsy may be due to the hydrodistention procedure itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].
