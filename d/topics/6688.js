Successful treatment requires prompt definitive medical evaluation, careful clinical assessment, and timely administration of antivenom in selected patients. Consultation with a medical toxicologist or other clinician with experience in managing poisonous snake bites is recommended prior to antivenom administration. Phone consultation with a medical toxicologist is available through a United States regional poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>The clinical evaluation and management of poisonous Crotalinae (rattlesnake, water moccasin [cottonmouth] or copperhead) snake bites is reviewed here.

Additional studies of rattlesnake bites suggest that there is an increasing number of significant bites, but mortality has remained at low levels since the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Approximately 5000 snake bites are reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most of these occur in adult males. Hospitalization occurs in about half of all envenomated patients. Clinical effects are more severe in children and in victims of rattlesnake or water moccasin (cottonmouth) envenomation. Among children 18 years of age or younger, venomous snakes, primarily copperheads and rattlesnakes, are responsible for half of the approximately 1300 annual snakebites based upon reports to poison control centers from 2000 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Elevation is usually avoided in true compartment syndromes and prior to antivenom administration in patients with venomous snake bites. After antivenom administration, however, elevation results in the drainage of subcutaneous edema and contributes to the reduction of the source of increased tissue pressure. If there is a concern for clinically significant, increased tissue, or compartment pressures, direct measurement with an appropriate device should be performed to guide additional management with antivenom and elevation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Measurement of compartment pressures'</a>.)</p><p>Ensuring adequate antivenom treatment is essential.

The role of dermatomy in the hand, when pressures are high enough to impair distal blood flow despite adequate antivenom and elevation, has never been demonstrated, and it is likely that providing an increased capacity for swelling will only result in additional fluid accumulation, with no ultimate benefit. By contrast, nonsurgical management of acute compartment syndrome in the hand has been described; a patient with a rattlesnake bite to the thenar eminence and a compartment pressure of 55 mmHg had full recovery after receiving large amounts of polyvalent Crotalinae antivenom (46 vials total) and 20 g of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>True compartment syndromes may result from direct compartmental injection of venom, particularly with the anterior tibial compartment, which is very close to the skin. In these instances, antivenom and elevation may still reduce compartment pressures by the reduction of extrinsic pressure, but persistent intracompartmental pressures may remain high. The indications for fasciotomy in this context are unclear. An animal model of direct compartmental injection of venom demonstrated improved outcomes with antivenom alone versus antivenom plus fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, in this model, fasciotomy was performed immediately after venom injection. Thus, surgical intervention for elevated compartment pressures following Crotalinae snake bite is controversial and should be guided by a medical toxicologist and surgeon with extensive experience caring for victims with snake bite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CROTALINAE (PIT VIPER) ANTIVENOM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483006443\"><span class=\"h2\">Fab antivenom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyvalent Crotalinae ovine immune Fab (FabAV, Crofab, Protherics) is the antivenom commercially available in the United States for Crotalinae (rattlesnake, water moccasin, or copperhead) envenomation.

Thus, the use of antivenom for patients with mild envenomation should be individualized on a case by case basis with the input from a medical toxicologist or other snakebite expert. For patients with Crotalinae envenomation but minimal and non-progressive swelling, pain, or ecchymosis, and in whom the decision is to withhold antivenom, we suggest close observation for 12 to 24 hours to ensure that progression of toxicity, as indicated by worsening local or systemic effects, does not occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53948 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72265\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72265 \">algorithm 2</a>).

However, FabAV therapy may change the short-term clinical course. In a blinded trial of 74 patients with confirmed copperhead bites (88 percent with mild envenomation), patients who received FabAV therapy (45 patients) had modestly better limb function at 14 days and lower use of opioid analgesia, but no significant difference in time to return of normal function (full function in 50 percent of patients by 21 days [range 3 days to 4 months]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Recurrent toxicity may occur despite initial control with antivenom. Recurrent symptoms may be local (eg, swelling), or systemic (eg, deterioration in the coagulation parameters following initial normalization). Recurrence may be related to the short half-life of Fab fragments or possibly dissociation of Fab fragment-venom complexes. In addition, antivenom may not reverse the thrombocytopenia following timber rattlesnake envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>We suggest that patients with Crotalinae bites and moderate-severe envenomation who have undergone FabAV administration receive scheduled doses of 2 g (two vials) every six hours for three doses to prevent recurrent toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53948 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72265\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72265 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63835\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63835 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Scheduled doses of FabAV appear to prevent recurrent toxicity. In an open label, multicenter trial of 31 patients who received an initial dose of FabAV with control of toxicity, the 15 patients who received scheduled treatment of approximately 2 g (two vials) every six hours for three doses did not experience recurrence while 8 of 16 patients in the group who only received further antivenom if recurrent symptoms developed required no further antivenom therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In some instances, total reversal of coagulopathy with FabAV is not possible, and the clinician may choose improvement in coagulation parameters towards normal as an acceptable outcome in patients who have no significant bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of late coagulopathy</strong> &ndash; Patients with abnormal coagulation within the first 12 hours after FabAV administration have a 67 percent chance of developing recurrent coagulopathy and should have repeat coagulation profiles checked every 48 hours until normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].
