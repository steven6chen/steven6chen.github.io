Anatomic and physiologic approaches to coronary artery disease are complementary but because of numerous factors not evident from angiography (eg, length, entrance angle, coefficient of separation of laminar flow) comparison data yield contradictory results. As a result, quantitative approaches to the angiographic evaluation of coronary anatomy are infrequently employed on a routine daily basis in most laboratories. The greatest advantage of quantitative coronary angiography is its theoretical freedom from observer influences and bias, thereby minimizing significant potential intraobserver and interobserver variability.</p><p>The technical issues related to quantitative coronary angiography will be reviewed here. The clinical utility of this procedure is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantitative-coronary-angiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantitative coronary angiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many techniques are available for computer applications that permit quantification of coronary stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A quantitative analysis of the angiogram requires some form of optical magnification of the cineangiographic image which, in turn, permits computer-assisted definition and quantitation of disease severity. With the off-line techniques, image acquisition proceeds in the conventional manner, with the generation of a digital cineangiogram displayed on the image processor. Digital quantitation of selected image frames can be made with or without electronic magnification, easily accomplished with modern digital quantitative software and analysis systems. </p><p>A two-times magnification factor is utilized in most laboratories, without regard to the optical system employed. The positioning of the camera and selection of the lens system is usually accomplished manually. After digitization, and prior to computer analysis, the images are stored in a specifically designed image processing system. These systems vary in complexity and cost, and are available with a large selection of hardware and software.</p><p>On-line digital systems and computer application packages have become widely available through commercial distribution. These systems are designed to facilitate accurate clinical analysis of thrombolysis, stent deployment, and other endovascular interventions. The major impediment to universal application of on-line quantitation has been image quality. Advances in image-enhancement continue to refine the utility of on-line quantitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Edge-detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the image has been acquired and digitally processed, computer manipulation is performed. The most critical component of the computational analysis is the algorithm of boundary delineation within the area of interest. This method requires identification of the arterial segment to be analyzed and an accurate computer-assisted vessel edge delineation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71072\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71072 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The identification of the segment-of-interest can be automated, semiautomated, or manual. The operator may interactively indicate windows of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], approximate borders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], or points along the center line of the vascular segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. More fully automated techniques are also available, in which the arterial center line is computed after manual assignment of the visually derived center of the vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, edge definition, which is more important to quantitation, is less easily accomplished. A manual technique can be used in the absence of computer manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. More elaborate algorithms can also be applied to this task, including first derivative, second derivative, and first semiderivative functions.</p><p>To derive quantitatively useful information from the arterial segment analysis, a calibration function converts measured pixels to in vivo millimeters, utilizing reference standards derived from the contrast filled catheter. Known spacing distances between radiopaque markers on specially manufactured catheters, or upon the measured diameter of carefully placed cylindrical markers along the body of the catheter are frequently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. More often, the known diameter of the angiographic catheter is used for the automated edge-detection of a defined catheter segment or manual delineation of the catheter boundaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Utilizing internal calibration from geometric analysis of biplane images, the errors of differential magnification can be potentially averted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Densitometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The densitometric methodology minimizes any distorting effect of lesional eccentricities upon those geometric assumptions that are required for area calculations by the edge-detection methods. With densitometry, assuming homogeneous distribution of radio-contrast in the blood pool, the errors in edge definition are minimized since the method utilizes the measurement of brightness profiles throughout the segmental diameters which surround the defined center line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. With application of this assumption, the difference in cross-sectional luminal area can be compared between normal and diseased vascular segments, using differences in the density of radio-contrast distributed within each cross-sectional area. These derived measurements must be corrected for radiation scatter by the subtraction of background activity. Additional radiographic variables can contribute to measurement inaccuracy, and convincing validation of this technique has not yet been forthcoming.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison of densitometric QCA with edge-detection and intracoronary ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is generally good agreement between edge-detection quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intracoronary ultrasound when normal coronary segments are evaluated. However, although edge-detection QCA is often used after angioplasty, it may not be accurate when complex lesion morphology results from the procedure, as irregularities in the new lumen due to disruption of the plaque may interfere with quantification. Use of QCA is often applied to lumen assessment after stenting, although the analysis is at times confounded by the same variables of image quality such as calcifications and stent struts. Densitometric QCA may be less vulnerable to inaccuracy. To further evaluate the role of densitometric QCA, one study compared measurements obtained with intracoronary ultrasound, edge-detection QCA, and densitometric QCA performed after angioplasty in 161 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Luminal dimensions, as obtained from densitometric QCA, matched those from intracoronary ultrasound more closely than those from edge-detection QCA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">QUANTITATIVE ANGIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional standard cineangiography provides a diagnosis and stratification of coronary disease based upon the degree of vessel narrowing relative to an assumed normal vessel diameter. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) reports the percent diameter stenosis as well as additional parameters, such as lesion length, area of obstruction, area of plaque, and minimal stenosis diameter. Hemodynamic parameters, such as resistance to flow and derived transluminal pressure gradients, have been calculated but bear little accuracy relative to direct intracoronary measurements. All of these quantitative manipulations are rendered more difficult when the vessel is diffusely diseased, which is common, and there are confounding effects of long segments of ectasia and atherosclerotic disease.</p><p>The reference diameter and the diameter of the diseased segment may change in response to pharmacologic or endovascular intervention. To minimize resultant variability and measurement error, the minimal obstruction diameter of the lesion is reported in addition to the standard percent diameter stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Several methods to calculate the minimal lumen diameter have been defined using the diameter of the normal reference segment in a user-independent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Quantitative analysis of long arterial segments has objectified diffuse disease, but this approach has not been universally accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VALIDATION STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Validation of the techniques of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) entails documentation of the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the numerical estimates of coronary artery dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It has been proposed that the accuracy of quantitation can be determined from the mean differences in measurements, while the precision of the methodology is related to the standard deviation of the measured differences, either among repeated analyses of the same vascular dimension or, in the case of experimental model systems, between measured and actual values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, in order to assess reproducibility, it has been suggested that a standardized series of angiographic studies be utilized within each laboratory, thereby quantitating interobserver and intraobserver variability.</p><p>Validation studies of the off-line edge detection techniques have utilized a number of experimental approaches. In radiographic &quot;phantom studies,&quot; &quot;stenoses&quot; of known dimensions (typically 0.5 to 5.0 mm) are fashioned from nonbiologic materials filled with radio-contrast agents and imaged angiographically. Results of these studies generally predict an accuracy of approximately 0.03 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Post-mortem studies provide a further source of in vivo validation; such studies typically describe correlation coefficients of &gt;0.9 between actual necropsy dimensions and the measured values by angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The observed relative absence of variability after serial quantitative analysis of a single coronary angiographic study is also promising: Mean differences in the predicted minimal stenosis diameter of approximately 0.10 mm have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Validation studies have been conducted for video densitometry as well, including necropsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and the study of phantom lesions within animal vascular systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The experimental placement and on-line assessment of phantom stenoses within porcine coronary arteries yielded measured mean deviations of 0.08 to 0.15 mm from the true stenosis diameters, whose known dimensions ranged from 0.5 to 1.9 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>For in vivo clinical applications, serial assessment of changes in lumen diameter indicate a threshold for angiographically detectability of 0.44 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A similar angiographic threshold for detectable true <span class=\"nowrap\">progression/regression</span> (0.40 mm) has been described in a cohort of men followed prospectively after coronary bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When vasomotor responses are minimized with pretreated with nitrates, 24-hour follow-up studies after percutaneous coronary angioplasty indicate that the mean difference in measured minimal luminal diameter varied by only 0.20 mm, a reproducible threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This study is in contrast to an observed significant increase in diameter percent stenosis representing the corresponding increase in the reference diameter of the normal segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Another source of in vivo validation, albeit indirect, is provided by the high correlation between the transstenotic pressure gradients derived from QCA and clinical observations during exercise myocardial scintigraphy using thallium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Automated angiographic measurements also correlate well with the results of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography. In this context, a minimal luminal diameter of 1.07 mm strongly predicts the likelihood of an abnormal functional response to dobutamine infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/quantitative-coronary-angiography-technical-issues/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9429751\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) is a method to provide more objective interpretation of the coronary lumenogram than standard visual estimation.
