People with HIV can get sick more easily than people without HIV. That's because their immune system cannot work as well to fight off infections or cancer.</p><p>One type of cell in the immune system that helps keep you from getting sick is the &quot;T cell.&quot; HIV lowers the number of T cells in your body. When you have lower numbers of T cells, you have a higher chance of getting a serious infection.</p><p>The last stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is at its weakest, is called AIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432534602\"><span class=\"h1\">Can HIV be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. While HIV cannot be cured, there are treatments that can help. People with HIV can take medicines to control the virus, keep their immune system strong, and stay healthy for many years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957516\"><span class=\"h1\">How is HIV treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat HIV with medicines called &quot;antiretroviral&quot; medicines. There are different types of antiretroviral medicines that work in different ways. Most people take a combination of 3 different medicines each day. Sometimes, the different medicines are combined into 1 or 2 pills. That way, people don't need to take as many pills each day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957523\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take medicines if I have HIV but feel fine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Doctors recommend that almost all patients who have HIV start treatment. That's because HIV can attack your immune system and other parts of your body without you knowing it. Also, taking HIV medicines lowers your chance of giving HIV to someone else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957530\"><span class=\"h1\">How can HIV medicines help me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV medicines help keep the HIV virus in your body under control. When you take your medicines every day, your T cell count will go up, and the amount of virus in your body (called the &quot;viral load&quot;) will go down. That way, your immune system can work better, and you can stay healthy for many years.</p><p>HIV attacks other parts of the body, too, such as the kidneys, heart, and brain. HIV medicines can help these parts of the body stay healthy.</p><p>HIV medicines can also help when women are pregnant. Pregnant women with HIV can spread the virus to their baby. The medicines lower a woman's chance of spreading HIV to her baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957537\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I start treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will decide when you should start treatment. Doctors usually recommend starting treatment right away, so you stay healthy. It is especially important to start treatment if your T cell count is low.</p><p>When you start treatment, your doctor will work with you to find the combination of medicines that is right for you. This will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your blood test results</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your medical conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many pills you want to take each day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you are thinking about getting pregnant</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957544\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know before I start treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is life-long. Once you start treatment, you need to take your medicines every day for the rest of your life. That's because your HIV can get worse if you skip doses or stop taking your medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most of the medicines are easy to take, they can have side effects. Let your doctor know if you have any problems or side effects from your medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You need to keep track of when and how to take your medicines. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about treatment. If you take a lot of medicines, you can use a pill box to help you organize your medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957551\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a clinical trial?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical trial is a scientific study that tests new medicines or new combinations of medicines to see how well they work. There are clinical trials for HIV all over the world. To find out more about being in a clinical trial, talk with your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4957558\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-monitor-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tests to monitor HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-with-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults with HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-hiv-after-unprotected-sex-or-needle-sharing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing HIV after unprotected sex or needle-sharing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
