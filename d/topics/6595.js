The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Acute Kidney Injury defined AKI as <strong>one or more of three criteria</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The first two were a rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> over a 48-hour period <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &ge;1.5 times the baseline value within the seven previous days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The third criterion was a urine volume &le;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for six hours. However, in a 70 kg adult male, this would represent a urine volume as high as 210 mL in six hours, which, if maintained, would be 840 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>. Many healthy individuals could meet this criterion if they had limited fluid intake. Thus, the authors and reviewers of this topic do <strong>not</strong> agree with making a diagnosis of AKI based solely upon the urine volume.</p><p>Other definitions and severity staging of AKI have also been proposed. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The two major causes of AKI that occur in the hospital are prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Together, they account for approximately 65 to 75 percent of cases of AKI. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis as a cause of AKI'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation and diagnosis of prerenal disease and ATN as a cause of AKI. The diagnostic approach to patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the possible prevention and management of ATN, and renal and patient outcomes after ATN are discussed elsewhere.

The etiology can be classified into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes.

When the mean arterial pressure is reduced, due to a reduction in either in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance, activation of these receptors increases sympathetic neural tone and the release of both renin (leading to the generation of angiotensin II) and antidiuretic hormone. The ensuing arteriolar and venular constriction and stimulation of cardiac function return the systemic blood pressure and cardiac output toward normal. The arteriolar vasoconstriction occurs primarily in the renal, splanchnic, and musculocutaneous circulations, resulting in the relative preservation of blood flow to the heart and brain.</p><p>Although these are appropriate systemic responses, renal vasoconstriction can diminish renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is flow dependent. In addition, if the compensatory systemic responses are incomplete, persistent reductions in cardiac output <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial pressure can contribute to the decline in GFR.</p><p>A common cause of prerenal disease is true volume depletion, which includes hypovolemia caused by dehydration, hemorrhage, or renal (diuretics) or gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea) fluid loss. Renal perfusion can also be reduced in edematous states such as heart failure and cirrhosis due to myocardial dysfunction and splanchnic venous pooling and systemic vasodilation, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H914954238\" class=\"local\">'Causes of prerenal disease'</a> below.)</p><p>With all of these processes that cause prerenal disease, the GFR is diminished because of decreased renal blood flow. The glomeruli, kidney tubules, and interstitium are intact. The appropriate treatment is to increase renal perfusion, as with volume repletion in patients with true volume depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Replacement fluid therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9870320\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute tubular necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe ischemia, ATN can occur. This can result in histologic changes, including necrosis, with denuding of the epithelium and occlusion of the tubular lumen by casts and cell debris. Postischemic (also called ischemic) ATN is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of ischemic acute tubular necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, this injury pattern is not universal, and the pathophysiologic mechanisms may be different in certain disease conditions. As an example, sepsis-associated high cardiac output failure is associated with dilatation of both afferent and efferent arterioles, which will reduce renovascular resistance and tend to maintain renal blood flow. However, the efferent arterioles usually dilate to a greater degree, which can lead to a decrease in intraglomerular pressure and therefore in GFR. Most of the evidence is derived from animal data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Any of the processes associated with prerenal disease can cause ATN, but kidney damage most commonly occurs in patients with hypotension, particularly in the settings of surgery, sepsis, or obstetrical complications. The other major causes of ATN include a variety of nephrotoxins that directly damage renal tubules via a number of different mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H914954245\" class=\"local\">'Causes of acute tubular necrosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although renal ischemia is the most common cause of ATN, the sensitivity of individual patients to a decrease in renal perfusion is variable. In some patients, a few minutes of hypotension is sufficient to induce ATN, whereas others are able to tolerate hours of renal ischemia without structural damage to the kidney, displaying the findings of prerenal disease, such as a normal urinalysis and a low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below).

The respective mechanisms are decreased cardiac output in heart failure and splanchnic venous pooling and systemic vasodilation in cirrhosis.

Decreased renal perfusion, reduced glomerular permeability, and excessive diuresis are among the mechanisms that may contribute to AKI.

This can occur by decreasing either afferent (preglomerular) arteriolar dilatation (eg, with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or calcineurin inhibitors) or efferent (postglomerular) arteriolar constriction (eg, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers).</p><p/><p>The effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is primarily seen in patients with underlying renal hypoperfusion due to true volume depletion, heart failure, or cirrhosis, in which prostaglandin synthesis within or near the glomerulus is increased by vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and norepinephrine and vasodilator prostaglandins help preserve renal reperfusion and glomerular filtration. The effect of angiotensin inhibitors is also seen in these settings since angiotensin II helps maintain the intraglomerular pressure and GFR by increasing efferent arteriolar resistance. The mechanism with calcineurin inhibitors is less clear. The supporting data are discussed in detail elsewhere.

If the urine output does not increase, renal function fails to improve with the restoration of intravascular volume, and prerenal disease is still suspected, invasive monitoring may be required to adequately assess the patient's volume status and help guide further therapy.

As a result, a cautious trial of fluids may be given (independent of the urinary findings) if it is suspected from the history and physical examination that an acute rise in the serum creatinine concentration may be due to volume depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two major causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in the hospital are prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Decreased kidney function due to prerenal disease occurs when renal ischemia is part of a generalized decrease in tissue perfusion and when there is selective renal ischemia. ATN can occur with prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe ischemia. This can result in histologic changes, including necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both prerenal disease and ATN can occur in a variety of settings. Prerenal disease may result from true volume depletion, hypotension, edematous states, and selective renal ischemia, while ATN is principally due to all the causes of severe prerenal disease, particularly hypotension, sepsis, and nephrotoxins. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful history and physical examination can frequently identify events <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disease processes that underlie prerenal disease or ATN, suggesting the underlying diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to a careful history and physical examination, the initial evaluation to distinguish ATN from prerenal disease includes a number of laboratory measurements, close examination of the urine, and (if not contraindicated) fluid repletion. The principal diagnostic measures are urinalysis, response to fluid repletion, and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). These three measures are used in combination with the clinical setting to help diagnose the underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urinalysis is normal or near normal in prerenal disease; hyaline casts may be seen, but these are not an abnormal finding. In comparison, the classic urinalysis in ATN reveals muddy brown granular, epithelial cell casts, and free epithelial cells. However, the absence of these urinary findings does not exclude ATN. (See <a href=\"#H26746321\" class=\"local\">'Urinalysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with a clinical history consistent with fluid loss, a physical examination consistent with hypovolemia (hypotension and tachycardia), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oliguria should be administered intravenous fluid therapy, unless contraindicated. This fluid challenge attempts to correct the fluid deficit and optimize renal blood perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Response to fluid repletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FENa is typically less than 1 percent in prerenal disease (indicative of the sodium retention) and above 2 percent in ATN. There are conditions in which this distinction is not accurate, such as ATN superimposed upon a chronic prerenal state such as cirrhosis, a setting in which the FENa may remain below 1 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum creatinine is widely used in diagnosing the presence of AKI. However, since it is a suboptimal biomarker for this process, different urinary and serum proteins have been intensively investigated. Although there are promising candidate biomarkers, none are currently approved for use clinically in the United States.
