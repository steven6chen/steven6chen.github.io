Establishing a diagnosis of asthma involves a careful process of history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic studies. The differential diagnosis of wheezing must be carefully considered, particularly in infants and young children, for whom testing for reversible airflow obstruction is not done routinely.</p><p>The initial evaluation and diagnosis of childhood asthma are reviewed here.

Evaluating the presence of asthma symptoms is an important first step in establishing a proper diagnosis.</p><p>Coughing and wheezing are the most common symptoms of childhood asthma. Breathlessness, chest tightness or pressure, and chest pain also are reported. Poor school performance and fatigue may indicate sleep deprivation from nocturnal symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a nocturnal cough, a cough that recurs seasonally, a cough in response to specific exposures (eg, cold air, exercise, laughing, or crying), or a cough that lasts more than three weeks should raise the suspicion for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although wheezing is considered the hallmark of childhood asthma, cough is frequently the sole presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most common cause of chronic cough in children older than three years is asthma, even if it is not accompanied by wheezing. The cough is typically dry and hacking but may be productive; when the cough is productive, clear or whitish sputum may be expectorated (which often contains eosinophils). It is not unusual for chronic cough lasting more than three weeks to be labeled &quot;bronchitis&quot; and to be treated with medications, such as cough suppressants, decongestants, or antibiotics. However, these types of cough may be manifestations of asthma and are likely to respond to asthma therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Wheeze</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wheezing is a high-pitched, musical sound produced when air is forced through narrow airways. The wheezing of asthma tends to be polyphonic (varied in pitch), reflecting the heterogeneous distribution of affected airways. When airflow obstruction becomes severe, wheezing can be heard on both inspiration and expiration. In contrast to asthma, central airway obstruction may cause a harsh expiratory monophonic wheeze, as occurs with tracheomalacia. Upper airway obstruction (eg, vocal cord dysfunction) should be suspected if an inspiratory monophonic (of single pitch) wheeze (typically called stridor) is the only audible sound during an exacerbation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-stridor-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of stridor in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A silent chest in the context of an asthma exacerbation implies airflow limitation of such severity that audible wheezes cannot be produced; this represents a medical emergency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-emergency-department-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute asthma exacerbations in children: Emergency department management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Seasonal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms that are worse in certain pollen seasons are characteristic of atopic asthma. Trees in temperate climates pollinate in early spring, grasses in summer, and weeds in the fall. Children who are sensitive to molds tend to wheeze or cough during rainy seasons or if they are exposed to flooding or indoor dampness. Other allergic symptoms, such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, or eczema, may flare concurrently with the chest complaints.

Exercise-triggered symptoms typically develop several minutes into prolonged exercise. Symptoms usually resolve with rest over 30 to 60 minutes. Lung function changes little or may even improve somewhat during most of the actual period of exercise. Lung function may begin to deteriorate towards the end of the exercise period and can fall quite markedly in some patients. The major fall in lung function normally occurs 5 to 10 minutes after stopping the exercise. Lung function then normally returns spontaneously to baseline over 30 to 45 minutes. A late-phase reaction occurs in a small proportion of patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and some patients have both an immediate and a late-phase response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

We allow our patients to swim and only advise against it if chlorine appears to be an irritant trigger in a particular patient.</p><p>Short bursts of activity tend to be better tolerated than prolonged exercise. Repeated short periods of exercise tend to result in diminishing EIB with each episode. Nonetheless, children with asthma do not need to be steered toward particular sports, since they can participate in sports at any level (including the Olympics) with proper treatment, and improved exercise tolerance leads to lower respiratory rates with the same level of activity.</p><p>If untreated, longstanding EIB may result in poor overall fitness, decreased exercise stamina, a preference for a sedentary lifestyle, and exercise avoidance due to the distress brought on by physical activity.

A trial of asthma medications may help to establish the diagnosis in these children. Reversal of symptoms and signs in the time expected for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> to work is suggestive of the diagnosis of asthma. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is an alternative to spirometry in younger children since it only requires passive cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. However, it is not readily available to most clinicians treating children with asthma, limiting its clinical utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. IOS measurements at baseline and postbronchodilator differed significantly between children aged three to six years with and without asthma, whereas no significant differences were seen with traditional spirometry. IOS may detect alterations in respiratory mechanics not seen with spirometry even in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p>Debate is ongoing regarding how to best classify infants and young children with recurrent wheezing. The terms asthma, reactive airway disease, wheezy bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthmatic bronchitis, wheezing-associated respiratory illness, and postinfectious bronchial hyperreactivity have all been employed. This jargon reflects an attempt to describe and define a subgroup of wheezing children with a more benign prognosis than is implied by &quot;asthma,&quot; which is, by definition, chronic. &quot;Wheezy bronchitis&quot; usually defines nonatopic babies or toddlers with recurrent, virus-induced wheezing (the majority of this group of wheezing young children) that tends to disappear by five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Asthma, on the other hand, has been taken to mean a chronic condition, frequently associated with atopy, provoked by a number of triggers in addition to viruses, and carrying a poorer prognosis for spontaneous resolution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-of-asthma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history of asthma&quot;, section on 'Infants and children'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wheezing phenotypes and prediction of asthma in young children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination, in conjunction with spirometry, are usually adequate to establish the diagnosis of asthma. Ancillary studies are most helpful to exclude competing diagnoses or to identify comorbid conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9440209\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergy testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy testing, done either by skin or in vitro testing, is helpful even in the very young child when used selectively. Specifically, when the environmental history uncovers exposure to furry animals (pets or pests), molds, cockroaches, or dust mites, it is worthwhile to test for these or other limited allergens to formulate proper avoidance strategies. Outdoor aeroallergens are unusual triggers in infants and very young children but may be triggers in older children. Food allergy testing is not helpful unless there is a sound history of gastrointestinal complaints, worsening eczema, urticaria, or asthma that is temporally associated with the ingestion of certain foods. Children with this type of history should be evaluated by a clinician familiar with food allergies and prescribed epinephrine since ingestion of a food allergen can be life threating in a patient with food allergies, particularly in a patient with concomitant asthma. In addition, when indicated testing reveals the presence of IgE antibody to any allergen, an atopic diathesis is demonstrated, increasing the likelihood that chest symptoms are due to asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9440215\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoprovocation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advise performing bronchoprovocation testing (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, cold air, or exercise) when the clinical features are suggestive of asthma but spirometry is normal and there is no response to asthma medications. An exercise challenge of sufficient magnitude may provoke symptoms in children with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. A negative bronchoprovocation study may also be useful in reducing the likelihood that a child has asthma, although it cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. For safety reasons, these tests should be conducted in a specialized facility with trained technicians and should not be performed if a patient has severe airflow limitation (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent predicted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Exercise challenge has a high specificity, whereas methacholine challenge had a high sensitivity. Bronchial challenge tests are discussed in greater detail separately.

In those children, the chest radiograph may display findings suggestive of causes for wheezing other than asthma including congenital malformations (eg, a right aortic arch suggestive of a vascular ring); evidence of airspace disease consistent with aspiration or cystic fibrosis; or findings consistent with asthma, such as hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, and mucoid impaction with atelectasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9440227\"><span class=\"h3\">Sweat chloride test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sweat chloride test below established cut-off values reduces the likelihood of the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in children with respiratory complaints in association with frequent foul-smelling stools or other evidence of malabsorption (eg, undigested food or oil), recurrent pneumonia, edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure to thrive. There should be a low threshold to perform this test in children with this clinical picture, even if prenatal maternal screening or newborn screening was negative, since identifying a patient with cystic fibrosis has major implications for the patient, the family, and future reproductive decisions. Mutation analysis should be performed even if the sweat chloride is below established cut-off values if the suspicion for cystic fibrosis remains high.

The lack of objective measures of pulmonary function in very young children and the relatively high prevalence of congenital and inherited disorders that present with wheezing make it imperative to consider the differential diagnosis of wheezing illnesses before making a diagnosis of asthma solely on the basis of wheezing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889 \">table 6</a>). In particular, other causes of wheezing in children must be excluded if there is a failure to respond to asthma therapy or if the history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination suggest alternative diagnoses. Cough is the primary manifestation in some children with asthma; therefore, the differential diagnosis for chronic cough in children should also be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75873\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75873 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74085\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74085 \">algorithm 1</a>).
