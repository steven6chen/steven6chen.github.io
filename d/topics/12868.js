PCNs account for more than 50 percent of pancreatic cysts, even in patients with a history of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;, section on 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p>PCNs are categorized using the World Health Organization histologic classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69594 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

IPMNs accounted for 38 percent of lesions, mucinous cystic neoplasms for 23 percent, serous cystic tumors for 16 percent, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms for 3 percent. When only the 376 patients who had surgery between 2005 and 2011 were considered, 49 percent had IPMNs, 16 percent had mucinous cystic neoplasms, 12 percent had serous cystic tumors, and 5 percent had solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. However, this series is subject to sampling bias, as it only evaluated resected PCNs. Most branch-duct IPMNs and serous cystic tumors do not require resection; thus the relative frequency of these lesions may have been underestimated.</p><p>Because pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occasionally appear cystic, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PCNs.

A technical review from the American Gastroenterological Association estimated that the risk of malignancy in a pancreatic cyst at the time of diagnosis is at most 0.01 percent (0.21 percent for cysts &gt;2 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the subset of cysts that were surgically resected, it was found that the risk of malignancy was 15 percent. However, there is significant selection bias in the surgical series in which cysts were resected. Factors associated with an increased risk of malignancy included cyst size &gt;3 cm (43 versus 22 percent if the cyst was &lt;3 cm, odds ratio [OR] 3.0) and finding a solid component within the cyst (73 versus 23 percent if there was no solid component, OR 7.7). There was a trend toward an increased risk of malignancy if the main pancreatic duct was dilated (47 versus 33 percent if the duct was not dilated, OR 2.4, 95% CI 0.7-8.0). There was no association between risk of malignancy and cyst enlargement over time.</p><p>In addition to the above factors, the malignant potential of a cyst also depends on the cyst type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57759 \">table 2</a>). Serous cystic tumors are at very low risk for developing malignancy, whereas the risk is moderate to high in mucinous cystic neoplasms, solid pseudopapillary tumors, and some intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas (IPMNs; up to 70 percent for main-duct IPMNs).

Cysts with malignant potential include mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs). There is little malignant potential with serous cystic tumors (SCTs). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62271701\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in evaluating a cyst is to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to further evaluate the cyst if not already done. A dedicated pancreatic protocol computed tomography (CT) scan is an alternative for patients who are unable to undergo <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRCP</span>. Cross-sectional imaging is obtained to determine if there are features present that can identify the specific cyst type and to determine if there are any findings that increase the risk of malignancy (large cyst &gt;3 cm, a solid component within the cyst, main pancreatic duct dilation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105742\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105742 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Findings on cross-sectional imaging associated with specific cysts include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57759 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serous cystic tumors</strong> &ndash; Well-demarcated multicystic lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66608\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66608 \">image 1</a>). A central scar or &quot;sunburst&quot; calcification is visible in up to 20 percent of SCTs and is considered pathognomonic. The microcystic variant of SCTs can mimic a solid mass on CT. Less often, the lesions are oligocystic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mucinous cystic neoplasms</strong> &ndash; Contrast-enhanced CT is the test of choice to diagnose MCNs. MCNs classically appear as a septated cystic lesion, although they can be unilocular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65253\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65253 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Main duct involvement is characterized by a diffusely or partially dilated main pancreatic duct filled with mucin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is predominantly found in the pancreatic head, but can involve any part of the pancreas. Branch-duct (BD) IPMN is characterized by dilation of side branches of the pancreatic duct. It is often seen in the pancreatic head or the uncinate process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While both CT scan and MRCP can assess the neoplasm, its relationship to surrounding structures, whether there is lymph node involvement, and if there is metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>], MRCP appears to be superior to CT scan for determining whether side-branch lesions communicate with the main pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is more sensitive for differentiating mural nodules from mucin globs since mucin has the same signal intensity as pancreatic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25-28</a>]. MRCP is also superior for demonstrating the internal architecture of the main duct and the extent of IPMN. However, MRCP is inferior to ERCP in demonstrating peripheral ductal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms </strong>&ndash; SPNs may appear as a mixed solid and cystic pancreatic lesion on cross-sectional imaging.

However, it is unclear if cystic and mixed solid and cystic SPNs will have the same MRI characteristics. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62273939\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62273797\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to evaluating pancreatic cysts is unclear. In 2015, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) published new guidelines on the evaluation and management of pancreatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The guidelines took into account the general low risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and attempted to limit invasive evaluations to patients with features associated with an increased risk of malignancy. However, these guidelines have not been validated in prospective studies and are based on low-quality evidence. In addition, data are becoming available that suggest if the AGA guidelines are applied, many cysts with advanced neoplasia will be missed. Our group examined 225 patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for pancreatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Pathology results were available for 41 patients, 13 of whom (6 percent of the overall population) harbored advanced neoplasia. The AGA guideline, when applied to this cohort, was 62 percent sensitive and 79 percent specific for detecting advanced neoplasia and missed 45 percent of IPMNs with adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. In addition, 27 of 184 patients (15 percent) with serous cystadenomas based on EUS-FNA findings would have required ongoing, but unnecessary, surveillance. As a result of this study, we devised a new algorithmic approach to the evaluation of pancreatic cysts with concerning features (eg, large size or solid components) that includes integrative molecular testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105742\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105742 \">algorithm 1</a>). Application of this algorithm to the study cohort detected advanced neoplasias with 100 percent sensitivity, 90 percent specificity, 79 percent positive predictive value (PPV), and 100 percent.negative predictive value (NPV)</p><p>The algorithm represents what we believe to be the appropriate approach to the evaluation of pancreatic cysts based on current knowledge. However, the approach to the evaluation of pancreatic cysts still needs to be prospectively validated and may change as more data become available. We use EUS-FNA for diagnosis and risk stratification in cystic lesions &gt;1.5 cm in size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for lesions with worrisome features (solid component within the cyst, main pancreatic duct &gt;0.5 cm in size, symptoms related to the cyst, family history of pancreatic cancer) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105742\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105742 \">algorithm 1</a>). We believe that identifying benign lesions like SCTs that do not require surveillance has cost benefits in the long run and provides reassurance for patients, while identifying IPMN and MCN more accurately provides justification for surveillance. To increase the diagnostic yield of EUS and FNA, we use molecular markers along with cytology and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The optimal approach to evaluation will likely be refined as more data become available.</p><p>Our threshold for evaluating cysts is lower than that in the AGA guidelines, which recommend patients undergo further evaluation only if the cyst has two or more worrisome features (defined by the AGA guidelines as size &ge;3 cm, a solid component, or a dilated main pancreatic duct). However, the AGA guidelines note that the evidence behind this recommendation is low quality and that it is reasonable to pursue additional evaluation if only one worrisome feature is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A 2016 guideline from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has a lower threshold than the AGA guideline for recommending EUS-FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It recommends EUS-FNA of cysts with any one of the following features: &gt;3cm in size, presence of an epithelial nodule, association with a dilated main pancreatic duct, or presence of a suspicious mass lesion. The guideline also suggests that EUS-FNA is optional for cysts &lt;3 cm without other indications for performing EUS-FNA.</p><p>In some cases, resection will be indicated based on the findings from cross-sectional imaging (eg, if a main-duct [MD] IPMN or a SPN is diagnosed) or because the lesion is causing complications (eg, pancreatitis), so additional evaluation will not be necessary.

The management of branch-duct IPMNs continues to evolve. However, the decision to recommend surgery should take into account factors such as the patient's age and general health, the malignant risk of the specific lesion, and the suspicion for malignancy (eg, malignancy is more likely if there are several worrisome features present).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-risk-factors-for-pancreatic-cancer-and-screening-of-high-risk-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial risk factors for pancreatic cancer and screening of high-risk patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management#H4472952\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Surveillance following surgery'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) is reviewed in practice guidelines published in 2007 by the American College of Gastroenterology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], in 2012 by the International Association of Pancreatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and in 2015 by the American Gastroenterological Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The optimal approach to evaluation and management will likely be refined as more data become available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many pancreatic cysts are discovered incidentally when abdominal imaging is obtained for unrelated indications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are four subtypes of PCNs, with varying malignant potential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69594 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57759 \">table 2</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serous cystic tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major challenge in the evaluation of PCNs is identifying lesions with malignant potential or signs of malignancy while not subjecting patients to unnecessary worry and testing. Cysts with malignant potential include MCNs, IPMNs, and SPNs. There is little to no malignant potential with serous cystic tumors. (See <a href=\"#H62273511\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in evaluating a cyst is to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to further evaluate the cyst if not already done (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105742\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105742 \">algorithm 1</a>). A dedicated pancreatic protocol computed tomography scan is an alternative for patients who are unable to undergo <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRCP</span>. Cross-sectional imaging is obtained to determine if there are features present that can identify the specific cyst type and to determine if there are any findings that increase the risk of malignancy (large cyst, a solid component within the cyst, main pancreatic duct dilation). (See <a href=\"#H62271655\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some cases, resection will be indicated based on the findings from cross-sectional imaging alone (eg, if a main-duct IPMN or a SPN is diagnosed) or because the cyst is causing complications (eg, pancreatitis), so additional evaluation will not be necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who do not have an indication for resection based on cross-sectional imaging alone, we pursue additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration in cysts &gt;1.5 cm in size and for lesions with worrisome features (solid component within the cyst, main pancreatic duct &gt;0.5 cm in size, symptoms related to the cyst, family history of pancreatic cancer).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many pancreatic cysts can be followed with surveillance imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105742\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105742 \">algorithm 1</a>). In general, surgery is indicated for cysts with malignant cytology; cysts that are causing complications; cysts with features concerning for malignancy; and cysts with significant malignant potential, including MCNs, main-duct IPMNs, and SPNs. The management of branch-duct IPMNs continues to evolve. However, the decision to recommend surgery should take into account factors such as the patient's age and general health, the malignant risk of the specific lesion, and the suspicion for malignancy (eg, malignancy is more likely if there are several worrisome features present).
