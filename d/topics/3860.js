The latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century produced confirmation that the pathogenesis of gout involves urate crystal deposition. Pivotal in this progress was the introduction of polarized light microscopy into clinical practice, providing urate crystal identification in synovial fluid as the means to achieve rapid and definitive diagnosis and to resolve the formerly ambiguous relationship between hyperuricemia and gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Further study increased understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of gouty inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the development of drugs capable of suppressing gouty inflammation and reversing hyperuricemia has provided means to prevent, and even reverse, the previously ravaging effects of acute inflammatory and chronic destructive manifestations of urate crystal deposition.</p><p>These advances have favorably influenced the course of gout in the majority of affected individuals, although the disorder persists as a problem, often with less than optimal clinical outcomes despite attempts at treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This is particularly true among nonadherent or poorly instructed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] and in patients whose demographic profiles do not fit what may have historically been considered the &quot;classic&quot; clinical profile of the gouty patient (ie, a 30- to 60-year-old man who is likely to be obese, hypertensive, and a frequent imbiber of alcohol).</p><p>These &quot;non-classic&quot; at-risk groups that are increasingly common differ from the classic profile in that they include patients of older age, an increased proportion of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], organ transplant recipients receiving diuretics and a calcineurin inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and the more frequent presence of concurrent illnesses and therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

Both the incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>] of the disease appear to be increasing since at least the late 1970s in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], where the prevalence is likely to exceed 3 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Childhood serum urate levels normally range from approximately 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and are similar in prepubescent boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, gout is rare in children, except in instances of marked hyperuricemia due to urate overproduction, such as inherited defects in enzymes of purine metabolism or diseases with greatly increased rates of cell proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a>), or due to severely impaired renal uric acid clearance, as in familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In men, adult serum urate levels of 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> are usually reached at puberty, with little increase thereafter due to age alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The corresponding age-related course of serum urate levels differs in women, in whom serum urate concentrations average approximately 1.0 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> lower than men of similar age; the lower levels result from higher urinary fractional excretion of urate during the childbearing period, which is mediated by estrogenic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. After menopause, the urate concentrations in women rise to levels comparable to those in adult men. The gender differences in age-related patterns of urate concentration appear to affect the clinical differences between men and women in the age of onset of gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]; increases in gout incidence are detectable in men by the fourth or fifth decades of life and in women by the sixth or seventh decades. These observations suggest an average period of asymptomatic hyperuricemia of at least 10 years or more in both men and women prior to the clinical expression of gout and provide at least a partial explanation for the greater prevalence of gout in men through at least the ninth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Estimates of the prevalence of gout in the United States range from less than three million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] to eight million or more individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>], the last of these estimates suggesting a prevalence of gout in excess of 3 percent of the adult American population. Increases in onset and recurrences of gout likely reflect changes during this period in demographic factors affecting both nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98500 \">table 3</a>). Notable among these factors are increased longevity and age-associated cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases in the population; the use of medications that alter urate balance as an unintended consequence of treatment for these chronic disorders (and to prevent organ rejection among transplant recipients); and increased dietary intake of foods and food additives (such as high-fructose corn syrup) that contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus. The epidemiology and risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout are described in more detail separately.

In this context, treatment with antihyperuricemic (urate-lowering) agents is not curative, but it may reset the course of the individual patient and provide what is effectively a cure if subsaturating urate levels are achieved and maintained.</p><p>Prior to the availability of effective urate-lowering treatment, the interval from the first gout flare to the onset of chronic gouty arthritis or detectable tophi averaged approximately 12 years, although intervals ranging from less than 5 to 40 years were noted in individual patients. During this era, duration of gout and degree of hyperuricemia were correlated with the rate and extent of tophus formation. After 20 years of untreated gout, almost 75 percent of patients were affected, with the highest prevalence of tophaceous gout in patients with the highest serum urate concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Urate-lowering treatment of gout with uricosuric agents and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> initially led to a dramatic reduction in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout, particularly among patients with primary gout who were adherent to treatment and among most patients with secondary gout, with a prevalence of less than 5 percent reported in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When progression does occur, it is most often among nonadherent patients, those to whom the management scheme has not been appropriately communicated, and those in whom the diagnosis of gout has not been made.</p><p>Other patients liable to show progression of gout include those intolerant of urate-lowering agents or those treated with inadequate doses of such agents, those receiving medications (usually for comorbidities) that interfere with urate-lowering agents, and organ transplant recipients. These factors differ from those associated with the manifestations of acute hyperuricemia (primarily acute renal failure) seen in the tumor-lysis syndrome or with other causes of massive tissue breakdown.

The diagnosis of a gout flare is most secure when supported by visualization of MSU crystals by experienced examiners using compensated polarizing light microscopy in a sample of fluid aspirated from an affected joint (or bursa) (see <a href=\"#H87543138\" class=\"local\">'Synovial fluid analysis'</a> above). The sensitivity of this technique in demonstrating negatively birefringent intra- and extracellular crystals in patients with gout flares is at least 85 percent, and the specificity for gout is 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].</p><p>However, gout flares may occasionally coexist with another type of joint disease, such as septic arthritis or acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (pseudogout). For this reason, an acute inflammatory arthritis in a patient with a previously established diagnosis of gout or the presence of urate crystals in synovial fluid aspirated from one of several inflamed joints or from a tophus does not exclude the possibility of a second, sometimes life-threatening, process (eg, systemic infection).

Additional approaches to consider in the event of a negative (no urate crystals seen) study during the gout flare include aspiration of a concurrently inflamed joint or aspiration of an uninflamed but previously involved joint or of a tophus if either is present, although aspiration of an uninflamed joint or tophus is less helpful in excluding an accompanying cause for the acute event.</p><p>Clinicians who are not skilled at joint aspiration should request the assistance of an orthopedic surgeon to obtain the fluid or of a rheumatologist to perform a joint aspiration and to help with the analysis of the synovial fluid.

In addition, the authors of the rule have developed a calculator for clinical use that provides a more precise absolute calculated risk of gout for the individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>] and is based upon statistically refined characterization of the variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>The rule was based upon an analysis of 328 patients with acute monoarthritis seen initially by family practitioners in the Netherlands; the patients also underwent prompt expert synovial fluid analysis. In the study cohort, scoring for low (&le;4 points), intermediate (&gt;4 to &lt;8 points), and high (&ge;8 points) probability of gout identified groups with a prevalence of gout of 2.2, 31.2, and 82.5 percent, respectively. This approach yielded substantially fewer false-positive diagnoses than those made clinically by the family practitioners (17 versus 36 percent).</p><p>Patients falling into the intermediate category would most benefit from further evaluation with synovial fluid analysis, as gout cannot be excluded or confirmed based upon an intermediate score alone. Thus, further investigation of such patients is required, including referral for joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis and detailed clinical reassessment. Advanced imaging, such as ultrasound or dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), may be of benefit in patients in whom a diagnosis of gout has not previously been established if appropriate expertise and technology is available. (See <a href=\"#H87542314\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2234732690\" class=\"local\">'Role of imaging in diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with an intermediate score, a tentative diagnosis of gout for the purpose of clinical management may still be made in the absence of crystals based upon a preponderance of evidence otherwise favoring the diagnosis (eg, inflammatory joint fluid in a patient with evidence of or known gout in the absence of infection, especially with a score in the higher part of the intermediate range). An alternative diagnosis should be sought in patients lacking sufficient features to support a tentative diagnosis of gout.</p><p>The diagnostic rule was validated by application to another cohort of 390 patients with monoarthritis who could conceivably have had gout and were referred to rheumatologists in a regional gout research center in the Netherlands by primary care and other specialty clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2234732690\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of imaging in diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We employ ultrasonography of affected joints selectively in patients with histories of multiple episodes of acute intermittent inflammation, especially when those episodes have involved one or a few specific joints, aspiration of synovial fluid is not feasible, urate crystals have not been detected by prior polarized light microscopic examination, and the diagnosis of gout remains uncertain.</p><p>Even though the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography and dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in the diagnosis of early gout was best established in more advanced disease, crystal deposition can be demonstrated by this approach in affected patients by practitioners with appropriate expertise.

Use of effective urate-lowering therapies has resulted in a reduced frequency of progression of gout to the tophaceous stage. All patients with gout have hyperuricemia (saturation of serum for urate) at some point in their disease, imparting the risk of urate crystal formation and deposition in tissues with inflammatory responses, resulting in the signs and symptoms of gout. Gout flares usually occur after years of asymptomatic hyperuricemia, although most hyperuricemic individuals never experience a clinical event resulting from urate crystal deposition. (See <a href=\"#H56522159\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous circumstances promote or are associated with gout flares, which are typically monoarticular and intensely inflammatory, with severe pain, redness, swelling, and disability. Maximal severity of the flare is usually reached within 12 to 24 hours. Complete resolution of the earliest flares almost always occurs within a few days to several weeks, even in untreated individuals. A polyarticular pattern is the initial manifestation in less than 20 percent of patients with gout but occurs with increasing frequency in later flares. Gout sometimes occurs with normal or even low serum urate concentrations at the time of the acute event. (See <a href=\"#H56523345\" class=\"local\">'Factors provoking gout flares'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Gout flares'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Typical gout flare'</a> above and <a href=\"#H87541587\" class=\"local\">'Polyarticular gout flares'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon resolution of a gout flare, the patient is said to have entered an intercritical (between flares) period, which is most often asymptomatic. This sequence is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Without urate-lowering treatment, the trend is toward recurrent gout flares that occur after progressively shorter asymptomatic periods and that are increasingly prolonged and disabling, are polyarticular, and may be associated with fever. (See <a href=\"#H56519131\" class=\"local\">'Intercritical gout and recurrent gout flares'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tophaceous gout is characterized by collections of densely packed urate crystals, which are occasionally calcified, in connective tissues and accompanied by a chronic inflammatory response. These collections can be visible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palpable but are usually not painful or tender; they can be present on the ears or in the soft tissues, including articular structures, tendons, bursas, or bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81692\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81692 \">picture 1</a>). Tophi may be detected with ultrasonography, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is likely that many patients with gout and sustained hyperuricemia have a much larger burden of urate crystal deposits than is suspected by clinical examination alone. (See <a href=\"#H56519694\" class=\"local\">'Tophaceous gout'</a> above and <a href=\"#H87542314\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis should be sought when a gout flare is suspected, both to exclude alternative explanations for the acute event and to ensure that long-term therapy is not prescribed unnecessarily. The diagnosis is most secure when supported by visualization of urate crystals by experienced examiners in a sample of fluid aspirated from an affected joint (or bursa) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116039\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116039 \">algorithm 1</a>). Ultrasonography of joints and adjacent soft tissues is useful for guiding fluid aspiration and can identify specific abnormalities that are highly sensitive and specific for urate crystal deposition.

This allows late establishment of the diagnosis in the majority of patients in whom the diagnosis was not made in the acute setting. Demonstration of urate crystals in aspirates of tophaceous deposits provides a convenient and specific means to corroborate the diagnosis in gouty individuals with clinically detectable tophi.
