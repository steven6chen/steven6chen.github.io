Amiodarone is the most widely prescribed antiarrhythmic medication in the United States, largely due to its efficacy in the management of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. In addition to the superior efficacy compared with most other antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone has very little negative inotropic activity, and a low rate of ventricular proarrhythmia, making it advantageous for use in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite these advantages, the use of amiodarone is associated with a relatively high incidence of side effects, making it a complicated drug to use safely.</p><p>This topic will review the electrophysiologic properties of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, clinical indications, and dosing recommendations for oral and intravenous amiodarone. The side effects of amiodarone are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-and-thyroid-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone and thyroid dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27142119\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is markedly lipophilic, resulting in a very large volume of distribution (average approximately 66 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> and a prolonged time to reach stable plasma levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is incompletely absorbed (approximately 30 to 70 percent) after oral administration and is taken up very extensively by tissue, with marked interindividual variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Estimates of the elimination half-life of amiodarone vary, depending on how the half-life has been measured and the route of amiodarone administration. The relatively short half-life for disappearance of amiodarone from plasma after a single-dose or short-term intravenous administration is likely a measure of drug redistribution from vascular space into tissue and not true body elimination. After long-term oral therapy, amiodarone has a true elimination half-life between 60 and 142 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Slow and wide distribution to tissue (fat, muscle, highly perfused organs) results in a requirement of long loading periods in an effort to accelerate the onset of drug activity. However, even with loading, arrhythmia recurrence during the first months of therapy does not necessarily predict long-term efficacy. Conversely, intravenous (IV) amiodarone begins to act within one hour, with rapid onset of action within minutes following an IV bolus.</p><p>There is little correlation between the plasma concentration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or its major active metabolite, desethylamiodarone, and drug efficacy or toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, which can lead to significant drug interactions.

This effect is primarily mediated by blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (IKr) that is responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the action potential.

However, in contrast to most other class III agents, amiodarone has very little proarrhythmic activity.

While there is no universally accepted dosing regimen, oral loading doses of 600 to 800 mg per day in divided doses for outpatients and 1.2 to 1.8 grams per day in divided doses in inpatients (up to a total loading dose of 10 grams) are often used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-amiodarone/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Gastrointestinal side effects may limit loading doses. The usual maintenance dose for AF is 200 mg daily.

Given the prolonged half-life of oral amiodarone, the drug should be started two to six weeks prior to elective cardioversion to reduce the risk of recurrence. Dosing regimens vary but generally aim for an oral load of 6 to 10 grams over a period of two to six weeks prior to cardioversion, with a decrease in dose to maintenance levels following cardioversion or shortly thereafter. Given the unique pharmacologic properties of amiodarone, AF recurrences in the first two to three months following cardioversion do not necessarily predict long-term failure of the drug.

There are important differences in these properties between the oral and intravenous preparations. (See <a href=\"#H27142126\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic properties'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> can slow the sinus heart rate, prolong the PR interval, widen the QRS complex, and prolong the QT interval on surface electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H6004686\" class=\"local\">'Effects on the ECG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is an effective antiarrhythmic drug for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Amiodarone is safe for use in outpatients and in patients with heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H6004209\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for the treatment of atrial arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is effective for restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm in critically ill patients with hemodynamically unstable AF. In addition, it can be used for rate control in critically ill patients with AF with rapid ventricular response (who failed cardioversion or are unable to be cardioverted) in whom the tachycardia is contributing to hemodynamic compromise. (See <a href=\"#H6004252\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous amiodarone for the treatment of atrial arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both oral and IV regimens of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> have been used successfully as prophylaxis against AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. (See <a href=\"#H17047241\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17047353\" class=\"local\">'IV amiodarone for prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> suppresses ventricular tachycardia significantly better than placebo, has less proarrhythmic effects than other antiarrhythmic drugs, and does not appear to increase mortality in heart failure patients. (See <a href=\"#H6004627\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite its effectiveness in reducing ventricular tachycardia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> has consistently been inferior to implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in reducing mortality in both primary and secondary prevention studies of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death. Thus, the use of amiodarone in this setting should be reserved for patients who are candidates for an ICD but who cannot or refuse to have an ICD implanted. (See <a href=\"#H6004642\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6004670\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an ICD who have received shocks for ventricular tachyarrhythmias report significant pain and a reduced quality of life due to fears about recurrent shocks. In this setting, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> is a highly effective adjunctive therapy to reduce the risk of further shocks. (See <a href=\"#H907869\" class=\"local\">'Oral amiodarone for the prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICDs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-therapy-in-survivors-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Treatment of breakthrough arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> following conversion from IV to oral administration varies according to the duration of IV treatment prior to conversion.
