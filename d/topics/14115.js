For PGD, the couple must conceive via in vitro fertilization (IVF). Preimplantation embryos are biopsied and only those unaffected by SCD are selected for transfer into the uterus. If HLA typing is also performed, unaffected embryos who are also HLA identical to an affected sibling can be selected to allow future stem cell transplantation of that sibling. PGD is expensive and may decrease the chance of achieving pregnancy and livebirth compared with natural conception, but there does not appear to be any long-term harm to offspring.

A gestational surrogate is a woman who agrees to carry a pregnancy for another woman (intended mother). The intended mother provides the egg and the intended father provides the sperm; egg donors or sperm donors without hemoglobinopathy can also be used. Conception is achieved via IVF, and the resulting embryo is transferred into the uterus of the gestational surrogate. The gestational surrogate has no genetic connection to the embryo.

An increase in major congenital defects was not observed in these limited human data, but has been reported in animal studies. Given the relatively small number of exposed pregnancies and the observation that hydroxyurea produced malformations in animal studies, it is prudent to discontinue hydroxyurea three months before conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In experimental animal studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferasirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferasirox</a> did not increase the risk of congenital anomalies at doses lower than those used in humans, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> was associated with congenital anomalies in some animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Data from exposure in humans are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], especially for deferasirox, but no toxic or teratogenic effects have been reported.

Women using these drugs for treatment of hypertension should be switched to another drug, ideally at least one month before they attempt to conceive. Women using these drugs for prevention of progression of proteinuric or microalbuminuric kidney disease should be counseled about early detection of pregnancy. In this situation, they may continue to use these drugs but should discontinue the ACE inhibitor or ARB if their menstrual period is delayed by more than two days, at which time they should have a sensitive pregnancy test and consult with their physician.

Penicillin has an excellent maternal-fetal safety profile for use in pregnancy. We do not routinely initiate penicillin prophylaxis because of pregnancy but continue it in patients who are already taking prophylaxis. In England, penicillin prophylaxis is recommended based on the hyposplenism associated with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], but evidence supporting this approach in pregnant women is not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> &ndash; Pain can be managed using standard therapies.

Whether NSAID use in the first trimester increases the risk of miscarriage, cardiac defects, or gastroschisis is unclear; epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Use of NSAIDs should be minimized, but a short course is reasonable given the lack of a clearly safer alternative.

Molecular testing for Rh variants is expensive and its clinical applicability is being studied.

These patients often have acute multi-organ failure. Neurologic events may be part of the multi-organ syndrome or present as independent ischemic episodes. Women with cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or infection are particularly vulnerable to decompensation at delivery and in the first postpartum week.</p><p>These life-threatening events may be preceded by acute painful episodes, so it is important to effectively treat vaso-occlusive episodes and monitor for early signs of life-threatening events. Patients hospitalized with a painful event should receive intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy as needed to maintain intravascular volume and oxygenation. Early evidence of impaired pulmonary, hepatic, renal, or CNS function should be considered a signal of an impending life-threatening event; an investigation for the cause of the worsening function (such as acute chest syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cerebral ischemia, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, HELLP) should be undertaken immediately. Transfusion therapy is often necessary before completion of the evaluation and the differential diagnosis to halt disease progression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stroke in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fever in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and joint complications in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059444\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion therapy is commonly used during pregnancy to treat acute complications, in preparation for surgery, and in selected preventive transfusion programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059452\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prophylactic versus selective blood transfusions to reduce complications of pregnancy in patients with SCD is controversial, as available data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-59</a>].

This includes (see <a href=\"#H1011610\" class=\"local\">'Prepregnancy issues'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluation of the patient's baseline status. (See <a href=\"#H18428063\" class=\"local\">'Prepregnancy evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Testing the patient's partner for hemoglobinopathy to determine type and risk of inherited disease in offspring, followed by genetic counseling. (See <a href=\"#H1482781\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discontinuing medications contraindicated in pregnancy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>, iron chelation, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) and bringing immunizations up to date. (See <a href=\"#H18428094\" class=\"local\">'Management of medications and immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Providing information on the course of SCD in pregnancy, the effect of SCD on pregnancy, and infant outcome. (See <a href=\"#H18429102\" class=\"local\">'Counseling about medical, obstetrical, and infant outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCD can be diagnosed preimplantation or prenatally. Prevention of an affected pregnancy is possible by a variety of assisted reproductive techniques. (See <a href=\"#H1482781\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H113604888\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe anemia and vaso-occlusive or painful crises are more common in pregnancy. As in nonpregnant women, severe pain should be managed with opioids. (See <a href=\"#H1058980\" class=\"local\">'Management of acute painful episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifications of prenatal care for women with SCD include an increased dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplement (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> checking ferritin level and only giving iron supplements or prenatal vitamins with iron if the patient is iron deficient, increased frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, ultrasound screening for fetal growth restriction, and fetal assessment in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H1058765\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alloimmunization should be assessed at the first prenatal visit. If negative initially, we usually repeat such testing at 24 to 28 weeks and again at the time of delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women with alloantibodies should be evaluated for risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and managed accordingly. In addition, the blood bank should be notified so that compatible blood is available for transfusion, if needed. (See <a href=\"#H1058765\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate hydration and oxygenation, keeping warm, and measures to reduce infection are important to reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion. The management of painful vaso-occlusive episodes is the same as that in nonpregnant women, except nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally avoided after 30 weeks of gestation because of an increased risk of&nbsp;premature narrowing or closure of the ductus arteriosus. Opioids are the mainstay of therapy in pregnant and nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H1058980\" class=\"local\">'Management of acute painful episodes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H98014712\" class=\"local\">'VTE prophylaxis during antepartum hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In SCD patients at high risk of complications, we suggest prophylactic transfusion therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Transfusion therapy should be individualized with involvement of a multidisciplinary team. Pregnant women with acute complications of SCD can also benefit from transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H1059444\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no medical contraindications to vaginal delivery in SCD. In the absence of maternal or fetal complications, awaiting spontaneous labor is reasonable. Induction of labor and cesarean delivery are performed only for the usual obstetrical indications. (See <a href=\"#H18078415\" class=\"local\">'Labor and vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with SCD who undergo cesarean delivery, we suggest postpartum prophylactic anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We also suggest prophylactic anticoagulation after vaginal delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We use low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). (See <a href=\"#H960389977\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum VTE prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After cesarean delivery, the duration of postpartum therapy depends on patient-specific factors. We administer LMWH for a minimum of 10 days to selected low-risk individuals such as those with a non-HbSS genotype who have a benign SCD course and no other risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). We generally administer LMWH for six weeks to patients with a HbSS genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a moderate to severe SCD history, older age, a history of pulmonary disease, an indwelling central venous catheter, a high platelet count, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of VTE or other VTE risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H960389977\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum VTE prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After vaginal delivery, we administer pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for five days but would continue anticoagulation in patients who remain hospitalized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal contraceptives and the copper-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) are safe and effective methods for women with SCD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Smith JA, Espeland M, Bellevue R, et al.
