Pancreatic cancer has become the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with the lowest five-year survival rates of any solid tumor (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of tumors (85 percent) are adenocarcinomas arising from the ductal epithelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical resection offers the only chance of cure. However, only 15 to 20 percent of patients have resectable disease at initial diagnosis; the majority have either locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The median survival for patients with untreated, locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is 8 to 12 months and only three to six months for those with metastatic disease at presentation. For patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy can improve survival. In the current modern era of chemotherapy, we have achieved the best outcomes to date with the FOLFIRINOX (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>) regimen, demonstrating an 11.1-month median survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Survival may be longer in patients who retain a performance status that permits administration of second-line chemotherapy. At least one series reported a median survival of 18 months in fit patients receiving both the FOLFIRINOX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/nanoparticle</span> albumin bound <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nanoparticle-albumin-bound-paclitaxel-nabpaclitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabpaclitaxel</a>) regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Because of the anatomic location of the pancreas in the central abdomen at the root of the mesentery, most patients suffer from a significant symptom burden, and they frequently need medical attention and hospitalization for symptom management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Typical patients will require numerous interventions targeting pain, anorexia and weight loss, depression and anxiety, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction, ascites, and venous thromboembolism.</p><p>This topic review will summarize an approach to these issues. A discussion on antitumor therapies for management of patients with localized pancreatic cancer (surgery, adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (who may be eligible for chemotherapy and radiation-based therapy), and chemotherapy for advanced disease are presented separately.

Many patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease will benefit from formal palliative care consultation and services. Early referral and initiation of palliative care services improve clinical and quality of care outcomes.</p><p>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary specialty that is focused on preventing and relieving suffering, and supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness, such as pancreatic cancer. Clinicians who are specialty trained in palliative care provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and coordinated care across settings and over time. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and can be provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64252 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H914800\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Palliative care services'</a>.)</p><p>When initiated early in the disease course, palliative care has been shown to improve clinical, quality of care, and survival outcomes. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that palliative care services improve patients' symptoms, allow patients to avoid hospitalization and to remain safely and adequately cared for at home, lead to better patient and family satisfaction, and significantly reduce prolonged grief and posttraumatic stress disorder among bereaved family members. Palliative care also lowers costs and reduces rates of unnecessary hospitalizations, diagnostic and treatment interventions, and nonbeneficial intensive care when patients are near the end of life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H914734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p>The impact of palliative care on reducing aggressiveness of end of life care in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer was shown in a retrospective population-based cohort study of administrative data on 5381 patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2010 in Ontario, Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Measures of aggressive end of life care included chemotherapy within 14 days of death and at least one intensive care unit (ICU) admission, more than one emergency department (ED) visit, and more than one hospitalization within 30 days of death. Of the 5381 patients (median survival 75 days), 2816 (52 percent) had received a palliative care consultation. Palliative care consultation was associated with a significant reduction in use of chemotherapy near death (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.46) and a significantly lower risk of ICU admission (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.08-0.18), multiple ED visits (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.16-0.23), and multiple hospitalizations near death (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.19-0.31).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970227448\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer should be offered aggressive treatment of pain and other symptoms related to the cancer, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cancer-directed therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3607283049\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain can be a significant feature of advanced pancreatic cancer, and all patients should have the level of pain and degree of pain relief from analgesics addressed at every clinic visit. Pain is often the major presenting symptom of the disease. Patients describe a gnawing midepigastric pain, which radiates bilaterally under the ribs and into the mid-back, owing to the proximity of pancreatic tumors to the celiac plexus. The mainstay of pain management is typically opioid medication, and palliation of pain can often be successfully achieved by opioid analgesics alone. For patients with persistent nausea and vomiting, for whom taking oral medications is difficult, pain control may be achieved using transdermal patches, provided they have sufficient adipose tissue for transdermal absorption. Because of the proximity of the tumor to the celiac plexus, the pain may be neuropathic in nature, warranting consideration of adjuvant medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Neuropathic pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894173325\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac plexus neurolysis and radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain can also be managed with local procedures targeting the celiac plexus. The celiac plexus is a dense network of nerves that innervates the upper abdominal organs. Pain may be relieved by inhibiting synaptic pathways within the plexus without nerve destruction (ie, celiac plexus block using a bolus injection of local anesthetic) or chemical destruction of the pathways and ganglia using dehydrated alcohol (celiac plexus neurolysis [CPN]). CPN can be performed percutaneously, surgically, or under endosonographic guidance. In the past, it has been most commonly performed intraoperatively or percutaneously with fluoroscopic or computed tomographic guidance. More recent experience has demonstrated that it can also be safely performed during endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-interventional-therapies#H380437032\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Interventional therapies&quot;, section on 'Neurolytic blocks'</a>.)</p><p>CPN appears to be more effective than pharmacologic therapy alone, both for immediate and long-term relief of pain, with reported success rates ranging from 50 to 67 percent in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Early referral for CPN provides better pain control, less opioid consumption, fewer opiate-related complications, such as constipation and sedation, and a better quality of life as compared with waiting until after failure to obtain pain relief with strong opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The specific approach to CPN, as well as indications for CPN, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions&quot;, section on 'Non-EUS methods (for celiac &quot;plexus&quot; neurolysis and block)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions&quot;, section on 'EUS methods (for performing celiac &quot;plexus&quot; neurolysis and block)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>A short course of palliative radiation therapy (RT) may also significantly alleviate pain due to local invasion of pancreatic cancer. External beam RT with or without concomitant chemotherapy is associated with resolution of cancer-related pain in 35 to 65 percent of patients, frequently with improvement in cachexia and obstructive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. However, it may take several weeks to achieve its maximal effect. Because relief from pain is generally faster with CPN, it is the preferred approach, when feasible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unrelieved jaundice from an obstructed biliary tree causes pruritus and an increased risk for cholangitis, although cholangitis is less common in native bile ducts than in previously stented bile ducts. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are commonly performed in jaundiced patients to distinguish obstructive jaundice from jaundice due to liver failure in patients with underlying liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensive metastatic disease. These studies typically demonstrate dilated intra- and extrahepatic biliary ducts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H158747091\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Jaundice'</a>.)</p><p>Palliation of jaundice is important to maintain liver health, prevent cholangitis, and restore bilirubin levels to a normal range to allow for the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H163255339\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Jaundice'</a>.)</p><p>Options for palliation of jaundice in patients who have obstructive jaundice from locally advanced, unresectable disease are surgical bypass or placement of a stent across the area of biliary tract obstruction. Palliation of obstructive jaundice in patients who are not undergoing an attempt at surgical resection is usually accomplished by the endoscopic or percutaneous placement of an expandable metal stent, while surgical bypass is generally reserved for those in whom stent placement is not possible due to technical reasons and for those found to be unresectable at the time of operative exploration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical options for achieving biliary decompression include an anastomosis between the gallbladder and jejunum (cholecystojejunostomy) or common bile duct and jejunum (choledochojejunostomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. A cholecystojejunostomy should only be considered if the cystic duct enters the common bile duct at a site distant from the tumor. A choledochojejunostomy should only be performed if the common duct is &gt;1 cm in diameter. Drainage is successful in returning the serum bilirubin concentration in approximately 90 percent of patients; in the remainder, persistent hyperbilirubinemia may be seen due to impaired hepatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>One advantage of surgical bypass is the ability to perform prophylactic or therapeutic gastrojejunostomy to avoid gastroduodenal obstruction and celiac plexus block for pain control (see <a href=\"#H3607283049\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3194406648\" class=\"local\">'Gastric outlet obstruction'</a> below). However, the risk associated with surgery in these typically debilitated patients is not small. In one report, the postoperative mortality and perioperative morbidity rates were 3.1 and 22 percent, respectively, and the median survival was 6.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As a result, surgical bypass is generally reserved for those in whom stent placement is not possible due to technical reasons, and for those found to be unresectable at the time of operative exploration. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents can provide minimally invasive, effective palliation of jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most jaundiced patients can be successfully managed using stents, and relatively few require surgical biliary-enteric bypass as a planned palliative procedure. Randomized trials and a meta-analysis have shown no difference in survival between endoscopic stent placement and surgical bypass for malignant obstructive jaundice; stented patients have more frequent readmissions for stent occlusion, recurrent jaundice, and cholangitis (below), but lower morbidity and procedure-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718237155\"><span class=\"h4\">Plastic versus metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of plastic and metal stents, both covered and uncovered, are available for endoscopic deployment. A systematic review and a meta-analysis concluded that, compared with plastic stents, metal stents had a lower risk of recurrent obstruction but were not superior with regard to technical success, therapeutic success, mortality, or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As a result, the decision to use one versus another should be guided by expected length of survival, quality of life, costs, and physician expertise (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H1135516949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Types of stents'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The placement of a plastic stent is inexpensive and effective, and the stent can be easily removed or exchanged. Plastic stents, however, eventually develop occlusion by sludge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial biofilm, and maintaining biliary drainage with plastic stents usually requires repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) since the median duration of patency is approximately three months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Patency of plastic stents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metal stents extend the duration of stent patency (approximately 8 to 12 versus 2 to 5 months). However, metal stents have significantly higher costs and may not be removable. Thus, the diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic disease must be firmly established before a metal stent is deployed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Plastic versus metal stents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient's treatment plan may not be known during the initial ERCP (eg, if biliary drainage is required before staging can be completed). Options in this setting include placing a plastic (and thus easily removed) stent or a self-expanding metal stent (which provides longer term patency). A Monte Carlo decision analysis compared several strategies in patients with obstructive jaundice from pancreatic cancer to an undetermined surgical plan, and the results suggested that a short-length self-expanding metal stent is the preferred initial treatment for overall cost minimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, the placement of a covered metal stent could be considered in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, especially if surgery is likely to be delayed (eg, for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with the prevalence of this approach increasing). However, this is a controversial area, and some surgeons prefer a plastic stent in this setting. It may be helpful to speak with the surgeon prior to stent placement if a patient appears to have a potentially resectable tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas#H176949520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Preoperative biliary drainage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis#H284616254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Role of preoperative biliary drainage'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718237106\"><span class=\"h4\">Covered versus uncovered stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trials have evaluated differences in stent patency rates between covered and uncovered metal stents for the treatment of distal malignant biliary disease; despite showing significantly less tumor ingrowth, patency rates are not higher for covered stents. This can likely be explained by the many other etiologies of stent occlusion other than tumor ingrowth, including tumor overgrowth and stent obstruction by debris and biliary sludge. One potential benefit of the covered metal stents is that they are more easily removable than are uncovered metal stents, but one disadvantage is a higher incidence of cholecystitis from extrinsic occlusion of the cystic duct. As noted above, the use of a metal stent in a patient who is a candidate for resection should be reviewed with the surgeon prior to placement.

Dietary intake should be assessed along with the possible need for dietary supplements. Some patients develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and require pancreatic enzyme replacement, which can help improve digestion and absorption of nutrients. An appetite stimulant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>) may be considered, although there is an increased association with thromboembolism with this agent, leading to a warning to &quot;use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371010783\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of appetite (anorexia) with weight loss is common among pancreatic cancer patients, but the profound weight loss suffered by patients with cancer-related cachexia cannot be entirely attributed to poor caloric intake. A disproportionate and excessive loss of lean body mass is the hallmark of cancer cachexia, which occurs in up to 80 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease. Inappropriately accelerated resting energy expenditure may contribute to the energy deficits; anorexia and poor oral intake also contribute, as do alterations in nutrient metabolism (eg, increased protein breakdown). A number of studies focusing on the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and body composition changes observed in cancer-related cachexia suggest a potentially important role for cytokine activation and for several tumor-derived and potentially cachexia-inducing substances, the target of which appears to be skeletal muscle gene products.

Although there are a limited range of studies investigating the incidence of exocrine insufficiency in pancreatic cancer, the available evidence suggests that pancreatic enzyme insufficiency is common, affecting 64 to 100 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer, even those who have not had surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>].

The typical characteristics of fatty stools associated with steatorrhea (loose, greasy, foul-smelling, voluminous stools that are difficult to flush) may not be evident because patients tend to limit fat ingestion. As a result, the main clinical manifestation is malnutrition and weight loss.

In a review of 129 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were referred to a specialist palliative care service in Australia, over 70 percent had symptoms that could be attributed to malabsorption (abdominal pain, bloating, gaseousness, and steatorrhea), but only 21 percent were prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333622530\"><span class=\"h4\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formulations of pancreatic replacement enzymes are comprised of multiple replacement enzymes, with dosing in increments of 12,000 international units. As a general rule, 30,000 international units of pancreatic lipase, swallowed during each full meal, should suffice in reducing steatorrhea and preventing weight loss. One-half of that dose should be administered with snacks. Determining the adequate amount of lipase can be confusing since the amount of lipase in commercially available pancreatic supplements is typically expressed in United States Pharmacopeia (USP) units. 30,000 international units is equivalent to approximately 90,000 USP units. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Lipase supplementation'</a>.)</p><p>Several commercial preparations are microencapsulated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 4</a>) and are designed to be acid-resistant, thus avoiding enzyme inactivation by gastric juice. Although data are limited, the efficacy of high-dose enteric-coated enzyme supplements was shown in two small placebo-controlled trials of patients with pancreatic insufficiency or pancreatic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>] and another in advanced pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]; in both studies, use of enzyme supplements was associated with improved weight gain and decreased fat and protein malabsorption. In another small randomized trial, enteric-coated enzyme supplements resulted in higher body weight gain than did non-enteric-coated supplements following pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Microencapsulated formulations will only delay the release of the enzymes in the proximal small intestine and are, therefore, intended more for patients who have retained the ability to secrete gastric acid. Nonencapsulated formulations may be more successful in patients who are achlorhydric or who have dyssynchronous gastric emptying (eg, Billroth II anatomy) since there is no need to protect the enzymes from acid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Lipase supplementation'</a>.) </p><p>Patients should be instructed to take enzyme supplementation at the start, at the middle, and near the end of a meal. Patient compliance is a key factor in the management of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency with oral pancreatic enzymes. In addition, underdosing of enzymes, acidic intestinal pH (the enteric-coated tablets require a pH&gt;5 for the pancreatic enzymes to be released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]), and intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also hinder the return of fat digestion to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].

However, this approach restricts intake of fat-soluble vitamins, which are already malabsorbed in patients with enzyme insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Furthermore, the available data suggest that the half-life of enzyme activity (both endogenous and exogenously administered) within the small bowel is enhanced by the presence of fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

For all of these reasons, fat restriction should no longer be considered the rule in managing patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Frequent meals of a low volume and avoidance of foods that are difficult to digest (eg, legumes) are generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2026833577\"><span class=\"h2\">Ascites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer may be due to peritoneal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Early referral for CPN provides better pain control, less opioid consumption, and a better quality of life as compared with waiting until after failure to obtain pain relief with strong opioids. Where local expertise is available, CPN is generally preferred over radiation therapy (RT) because relief from pain is generally faster with CPN.

(See <a href=\"#H120656703\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Available choices for prophylaxis include low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> at doses recommended by the manufacturer. For most patients, we suggest LMWH for primary prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults#H79882310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The standard approach to <strong>treatment</strong> of a documented (symptomatic or incidentally found) VTE in a patient with pancreatic cancer is early initiation of anticoagulation. For patients with active cancer, we suggest lifelong therapy rather than a short period of anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The decision to continue anticoagulation must be balanced against the risk of bleeding, cost of therapy, quality of life, life expectancy, and patient preference. We suggest LMWH over a vitamin K antagonist or oral factor Xa inhibitor for most patients who will need long-term anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H120656759\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss and anorexia are common in patients with pancreatic cancer, and the etiology is often multifactorial. All patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer merit a consultation with a nutritionist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dietician, if this service is available. Dietary intake should be assessed along with the possible need for dietary supplements or an appetite stimulant, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>, with assessment of the risks and benefits of individual agents on a patient-by-patient basis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anorexia, cachexia, and weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One contributory factor may be pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which leads to fat malabsorption, the main clinical manifestation of which is weight loss. We suggest that patients who are suspected of having fat malabsorption be treated empirically with oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Adequate dosing and patient compliance are critical to the success of therapy. Adequate doses of lipase (30,000 international units) should be delivered into the duodenum together with meals. (See <a href=\"#H371010769\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer may be due to peritoneal metastases. However, among patients with locally advanced tumors, ascites may be caused by portal vein thrombus if the tumor compresses the portal vein locally. In either case, patients may benefit from intermittent paracentesis or, if the ascites reaccumulates quickly, from placement of a long-term drainage catheter. (See <a href=\"#H2026833577\" class=\"local\">'Ascites'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siegel RL, Miller KD, Jemal A.
