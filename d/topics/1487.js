This topic will review the most common cytopathologic findings and the clinical entities they represent. Thyroid biopsy techniques (including core needle biopsies) and their indications, utility, and complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1928059\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLICULAR LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytologic diagnosis of follicular lesion includes cells with a macrofollicular (abundant colloid, fragments of macrofollicles forming flat sheets of uniform follicular cells), microfollicular (scant colloid, small microfollicles or &quot;rosettes&quot; of crowded cells), or mixed (macrofollicles and microfollicles, or cells with mild nuclear atypia, or extensive oncocytic change) pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70424 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign (macrofollicular) cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This pattern may also be referred to as adenomatoid, hyperplastic, or colloid adenomas. Large colloid-filled thyroid follicles are found in normal thyroid tissue, sporadic goiter, and monoclonal macrofollicular tumors.</p><p>Surgical specimens of sporadic goiter often contain many such macrofollicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71842 \">picture 1</a>). During needle aspiration, the follicles are frequently disrupted so that the colloid is smeared across the slide or occasionally is aggregated into droplets. The follicular cells lining the follicles may remain intact or break apart and form sheets.</p><p>Cytology of macrofollicular nodules may show both intact macrofollicles and macrofollicles that have been broken apart forming a flat sheet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76239 \">picture 2</a>). The cells appear uniform in size and are not crowded together. Follicle size may vary, with a few microfollicles interspersed among the macrofollicles, especially if the sample was obtained from an area close to the capsule of the lesion. At high power, the follicular cells are seen to be small, uniform in size, flat, and non-crowded, and smeared colloid is seen in the background (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64419 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Macrofollicular nodules may have areas of cystic degeneration with cellular debris and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. There may be focal H&uuml;rthle (oxyphil) cell change and rarely multinucleated giant cells. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'H&uuml;rthle cells'</a> below.)</p><p>Colloid, which stains blue on a Papanicolaou stain, is usually abundant in the background of macrofollicular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52463 \">picture 4</a>). Colloid may also be obtained from colloid cysts, and those smears may have few or no intact follicular cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular neoplasm/microfollicular cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This pattern may also be referred to as cellular or indeterminate. Microfollicular cytology may be seen in aspirates from follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas, follicular variant of papillary cancer, and occasionally from autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.</p><p>Microfollicles are easily identified in specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74281\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74281 \">picture 5</a>). Colloid is absent or scant, and the cells are more crowded than in macrofollicular nodules and may form clusters. Well-developed microfollicles, crowding, and scant colloid is the least worrisome pattern. More suspicious is the absence of follicle formation, cells arranged in clusters and clumps, and varying nuclear atypia and cellular pleomorphism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54002 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Since FNA samples only a portion of the nodule, surgical excision and extensive sectioning are required to determine if a microfollicular lesion is benign or malignant. Microfollicular nodules which do not show vascular or capsular invasion after surgical excision are considered benign, while those that demonstrate even focal microscopic invasion are classified as follicular carcinomas. Surgically excised microfollicular adenomas show well-developed microfollicles with considerably less colloid than is seen in macrofollicular nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61481 \">picture 7</a>). This pattern of well-developed microfollicles was previously referred to as a &quot;fetal adenoma&quot; as it is reminiscent histologically of the fetal thyroid. However, if invasion is seen, then, as noted above, the pathologic diagnosis is follicular cancer. Lesions with less definite or no follicle formation, called cellular or trabecular adenomas (previously referred to as &quot;embryonal adenomas&quot;), are more likely to show vascular or capsule invasion.</p><p>Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (which are virtually always benign) may appear to be suspicious for a follicular neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3109040\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) or atypia of undetermined significance (AUS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This designation is used when there are cells with mild nuclear atypia (AUS), when the lesion has approximately equal number of macrofollicular fragments and microfollicles (FLUS), or when there is extensive oncocytic (H&uuml;rthle cell) change but not enough to be classified as H&uuml;rthle cell neoplasm (AUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This designation is also used for specimens that are compromised because of poor fixation or obscuring blood (FLUS).</p><p>Nodules with features of both macrofollicular fragments and microfollicular lesions are common, especially in nodular goiters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">H&uuml;rthle cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>H&uuml;rthle cells (also called oncocytes or Askanazy or oxyphil cells) are large, polyclonal cells with abundant oxyphil cytoplasm. Sheets of H&uuml;rthle cells are seen in H&uuml;rthle-cell adenomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60286\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60286 \">picture 8</a>). Analogous to microfollicular adenomas, H&uuml;rthle-cell adenomas are benign if there is no evidence of vascular or capsular invasion on pathologic examination of the excised nodule, and malignant (H&uuml;rthle-cell cancer or follicular cancer, oxyphil cell type) if invasion is present.</p><p>Focal H&uuml;rthle-cell change can be seen in both degenerating macrofollicular lesions and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Because of limited sampling, scant FNA specimens from these disorders may show apparent sheets of H&uuml;rthle cells and can result in a false positive cytologic diagnosis of a H&uuml;rthle-cell tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is considerable histologic variability in both fine needle aspiration (FNA) and histologic specimens from Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In surgical specimens, some sections are composed of normal-appearing follicles with minimal lymphocytic infiltration, while other areas show complete destruction of follicles with dense lymphocytic infiltration and lymphoid germinal centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57542 \">picture 9</a>). Plasma cells are commonly seen, as are H&uuml;rthle-cell changes in the remaining follicular cells, and fibrosis may be prominent.</p><p>Each of these findings may be the major cytologic feature in fine needle aspirates. In some patients, the aspirates consist mostly of lymphocytes surrounding rare follicular cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74981 \">picture 10</a>). Since blood lymphocytes contaminate most FNA specimens, the diagnosis of thyroiditis can be challenging. However, lymphocytes embedded within tissue are more fragile and tear easily when smeared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54693\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54693 \">picture 11</a>).</p><p>Some aspirates are devoid of any follicular cells and may be read as nondiagnostic. Nevertheless, a presumptive diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be made if other cytologic features are present, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, germinal centers, and fibrotic follicles and if the clinical presentation is compatible with this disorder. Another potential problem is that the H&uuml;rthle (oxyphil) cell changes may result in a false positive interpretation of a H&uuml;rthle-cell tumor. In addition, it may be necessary to do flow cytometry when cytology specimens show only lymphocytes to exclude the possibility of a well-differentiated lymphoma.</p><p>Since the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be made in most patients on the basis of the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, FNA should not be performed unless a discrete nodule is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PAPILLARY CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with papillary cancer, the surgical specimen typically shows a papillary structure, with or without follicles, and little or no colloid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81310\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81310 \">picture 12</a>). In occasional cases, only follicular development is seen. The diagnosis of papillary cancer then is based upon the cytologic features of the cells; these tumors are called the follicular variant of papillary cancer. It has been proposed that encapsulated noninvasive follicular variant papillary cancers not be labeled a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The proposal suggests that such tumors be treated similar to a follicular neoplasm that has not invaded its capsule or blood vessels and is called a follicular adenoma rather than a follicular cancer. Importantly, these noninvasive follicular tumors, with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) can only be diagnosed after surgical excision.</p><p>Papillary carcinomas have distinct cytologic features that can be seen in high power views of fine needle aspirates. The cells and nuclei are large, and their cytoplasm has a &quot;ground glass&quot; appearance. The nuclei have clefts, grooves, and &quot;holes&quot; due to intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (&quot;Orphan Annie eyes&quot;), and the nucleoli are small (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71385 \">picture 13</a>). Other features include psammoma bodies, sticky or &quot;bubblegum&quot; colloid, and occasional epithelioid giant cells.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psammoma bodies are small, laminated calcifications that are frequently seen in papillary carcinomas but can rarely occur in benign thyroid lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72821\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72821 \">picture 14</a>). The laminations can best be seen under the microscope by moving the depth of focus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sticky colloid is seen in papillary carcinomas. Although colloid is scant in this disorder, the colloid that is present appears to &quot;stick&quot; to debris and cell clusters, instead of smearing across the slide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57514 \">picture 15</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelioid giant cells can be seen in papillary carcinomas but are also frequently seen in degenerating areas of macrofollicular nodules and in subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67770 \">picture 16</a>). However, patients with the latter disorder rarely undergo fine needle aspiration (FNA), because the clinical manifestations of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis are so characteristic that FNA is rarely indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDULLARY CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical specimens from patients with medullary cancer of the thyroid show spindle-shaped and frequently pleomorphic cells without follicle development because these cells originate from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82093 \">picture 17</a>). Occasional red cytoplasmic granules are seen, and the supporting stroma frequently stains for amyloid.</p><p>Identification of medullary cancer in fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens can be difficult because the cells tend to disperse on the slide. Their nuclei are placed eccentrically, and they are larger and more pleomorphic than those of normal follicular cells. The cytoplasm may be slightly granular and is usually configured as a tear drop or cytoplasmic tail. If the diagnosis is suspected, immunocytologic staining for calcitonin should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56242 \">picture 18</a>). The cellular pleomorphism and lack of follicular development usually results in a recommendation for surgical excision even if the diagnosis is not made on FNA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical importance of thyroid nodules is primarily related to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is present in 4 to 6.5 percent of thyroid nodules. If a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.
