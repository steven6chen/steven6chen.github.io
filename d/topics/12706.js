Normal wound healing is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications#H4141272043\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;, section on 'Impaired wound healing'</a>.)</p><p>The precise timeline for complete epithelialization varies depending on numerous factors, including comorbidities (eg, diabetes, autoimmune disease, peripheral artery disease), increased body mass index, anatomic location, and medications. However, regardless of etiology, wound healing normally progresses at a sustained, measureable rate. Although there is no specific time frame that clearly differentiates an acute from a chronic wound, some suggest that the lack of approximately 15 percent reduction weekly or approximately 50 percent reduction of the surface area of the wound over a one-month period indicates a chronic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Examples of chronic wounds include nonhealing or infected surgical or traumatic wounds, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and ischemic ulcers. Chronic wounds related to malignancy require appropriate treatment of the malignancy, but in some cases, palliation may be all that can be offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The clinical assessment and differentiation of these wounds is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-wounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of wounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051304\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL CARE OF CHRONIC WOUNDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local treatment is directed toward reducing pain and itching, minimizing infection and bleeding from the wound, and dealing with the most troublesome chronic wound problems that affect the patient physically and emotionally, such as excess exudate that can lead to unpleasant odors. </p><p>As with acute wounds, local care of chronic wounds includes debridement and proper wound dressings. Frankly necrotic debris should be aggressively removed. Proper local care is an important element of preparing the wound bed to accept a skin graft or flap, or for closure, when indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound debridement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound dressings'</a> and <a href=\"#H45051884\" class=\"local\">'Wound bed preparation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051741\"><span class=\"h2\">Odor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound odor can be controlled with interval mechanical debridement to decrease the microbial bioburden on the wound surface, with topical antimicrobial therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with odor-absorbing dressings such as those that have absorptive charcoal within the dressing (eg, Actisorb, Carboflex). Soaks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> or Dakin solution can also help to minimize odor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45052029\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nonadherent dressing can be placed directly on the friable wound to reduce bleeding and reduce pain associated with dressing changes. A second layer of alginate dressings that contain coagulants can also help to minimize bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Chronic wounds that are prone to oozing from the ulcer bed (eg, malignant wounds that cannot be excised) can be controlled with topical hemostatic agents or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and gentle pressure in the form of elastic bandages, with focal points of bleeding managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>, handheld cautery, or local anesthetic with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.

Itching is usually due to dry skin or contact dermatitis. Keeping the skin moisturized and protected will help reduce itching, and, if necessary, topical corticosteroid creams can be applied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults#H26143837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irritant contact dermatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45052043\"><span class=\"h2\">Exudate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An absorptive dressing should be placed over the nonadherent dressing to control drainage and reduce periwound maceration and tailored to the specific anatomic location and wound depth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Alternatively, wound drainage can be drawn away using a collecting device (eg, ostomy appliance, negative pressure wound therapy device), provided there are no contraindications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound debridement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound dressings'</a> and <a href=\"#H450973\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051780\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain associated with the wound, and specifically with dressing changes, should not be ignored. The World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which was developed for the treatment of cancer-related pain, is applicable to other types of chronic pain. For patients receiving stable doses of a long-acting opioid around the clock, supplemental doses of a short-acting agent should be considered prior to dressing changes, if they are painful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051165\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, surgical intervention of chronic wounds, which frequently requires multiple staged surgical procedures, is used to prepare the wound bed first by managing infection and handling any underlying factors contributing to wound chronicity (eg, bony deformities, foreign body, biomechanical instability), and then to subsequent coverage of the wound, which may require surgical revascularization. If these are successful in converting the chronic wound to an acute wound, provisional or definitive wound coverage can be performed. (See <a href=\"#H45051884\" class=\"local\">'Wound bed preparation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H105660167\" class=\"local\">'Wound coverage/closure'</a> below.)</p><p>Chronic wounds from cutaneous ulceration that occur in the setting of systemic disease states such as vasoocclusive, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, scleroderma) are difficult to treat and are often colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Appropriate medical management of the underlying condition must be addressed prior to any planned definitive surgical procedure. </p><p>As an example, pyoderma gangrenosum is a specific case of a chronic wound where surgical intervention is not typically indicated unless appropriate medical management has first been conducted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgery has inherent risks associated with the procedure itself as well as anesthesia-related risks. Medical optimization is important to decrease the risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The risks and benefits of surgery should be assessed to determine if the surgical intervention is the best course of treatment. Chronic wounds associated with malignancy can often be approached surgically if there are no prohibitive comorbidities and doing so aligns with the patient's goals for care. Even with advanced systemic disease, surgical debridement of the wound is possible.</p><p>Some patients may be too sick or disabled to undergo repeated procedures, which are often necessary to achieve wound closure. For debilitated patients with chronic lower extremity ischemia or malignancy-related wounds on the lower extremity, primary amputation may be a more appropriate course of action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-amputation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity amputation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051884\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND BED PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound bed preparation is defined as the process of removing local barriers to wound healing to maximize the potential for successful healing. This is accomplished primarily through debridement. Adjunctive methods to aid in preparing the chronic wound bed include negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which are discussed briefly below and in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H450961\" class=\"local\">'Operative debridement'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1044338494\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450961\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Debridement removes nonviable tissue, pathogens (biofilm), contaminants, and foreign (or other) material and also drains areas of infection. It is important that debridement includes the base of the wound as well as the wound perimeter. </p><p>Chronic wounds may require serial debridement in the operating room to sufficiently prepare the wound bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinic-based debridement often does not allow for sufficiently aggressive removal of nonviable tissue and biofilm due to inadequate pain control and the limited ability to achieve hemostasis. The operating room is a safer environment for the debridement of chronic wounds, which often require the management of deeper soft tissue and bone-related issues. In some cases, it is more appropriate to debride the wounds in the operating room, even if no definitive <span class=\"nowrap\">closure/coverage</span> is planned, due to the degree of nonviable <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/contamination/infection</span>. </p><p>For chronic wounds that appear infected, <span class=\"nowrap\">wound/tissue</span> cultures should be obtained during operative debridement to help direct antimicrobial therapy. If the etiology of the wound is unknown or the wound displays atypical characteristics, an excisional biopsy of the wound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wound perimeter should be also be obtained for histology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1044338494\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450973\"><span class=\"h3\">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), also called vacuum-assisted wound closure, refers to wound dressing systems that continuously or intermittently apply subatmospheric pressure to the surface of a wound. NPWT promotes the development of granulation tissue to cover deeper exposed tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. NPWT is primarily used in situations where healing is expected. NPWT can also provide programmable intermittent fluid irrigation between operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Information regarding the mechanism of action and use of this device and contraindications (eg, malignancy in the wound) for its use are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NPWT may improve the healing of some types of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">wounds/ulceration</span> provided that they are well vascularized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Patients with extremity wounds and inadequate peripheral pulses should undergo noninvasive vascular testing to confirm adequate perfusion prior to instituting NPWT, especially patients with diabetes or other risk factors for peripheral artery disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with conventional dressing changes, NPWT reduces time to closure of diabetic foot ulcers and wounds resulting from diabetic foot surgery. In this population of patients, NPWT is also associated with shorter length of hospitalization, decreased complication rates, and reduced costs. The use of NPWT in the management of diabetic foot lesions is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H105660173\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic foot wounds'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three randomized trials have evaluated the use of NPWT as an adjunctive therapy for the management of pressure (decubitus) ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. No significant differences were identified with respect to quantitative wound healing measures (eg, wound surface area reduction). However, NPWT improved patient comfort and was less labor intensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H45051220\" class=\"local\">'Pressure ulcers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPWT has been used instead of traditional bolstering methods to provide skin graft fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The NPWT dressing distributes negative pressure uniformly over the surface of the fresh graft, immobilizing the graft with less chance of shearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Improved qualitative skin graft take and quantitative improvements in skin graft success (eg, reduced number of repeat grafts) have been described in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>] and in two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one of the trials, 60 patients were randomly assigned to conventional bolster dressing or NPWT following split-thickness skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. NPWT was associated with significant reduction in the loss of graft area (0 versus 4.5 cm<sup>2</sup> in the control group) and the median duration of hospitalization (13.5 versus 17 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abdominal wall of patients undergoing exploration for severe abdominal trauma is frequently left open to facilitate second-look operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In this patient population, NPWT improves the success of both early and late (&gt;9 days) fascial closure. A general discussion of the management of the open abdomen is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H45051214\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal wounds'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450979\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used as an adjunct to wound care in the treatment of chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. HBOT has been shown to have in vitro effects on wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. HBOT may also aid wound bed preparation by increasing local tissue oxygen perfusion prior to the definitive surgical procedure, which may be particularly important for wounds that develop as a late effect of radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/30,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38-40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment#H975122994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;, section on 'Hyperbaric oxygen'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies of HBOT in chronic wounds are observational, and the few available trials are limited by small sample size and low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Systematic reviews have concluded that, although hyperbaric oxygen may benefit some types of wounds (eg, postradiation therapy), there is insufficient evidence to support routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>Although HBOT has been associated with more rapid ulcer healing in patients with diabetes, the indications for hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers remain uncertain. Although a number of series and randomized trials of various sizes and quality have suggested its utility, later studies suggest that HBOT has no benefit for diabetic foot ulcer healing and limb salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. HBOT for the management of diabetic foot ulceration is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H105660173\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic foot wounds'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for HBOT for venous or pressure ulcers, and wounds related to chronic ischemia due to peripheral artery disease, is lacking. (See <a href=\"#H454129\" class=\"local\">'Venous stasis ulcers'</a> below and <a href=\"#H45052081\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic ulcers and gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105660167\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND COVERAGE/CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures that provide wound <span class=\"nowrap\">coverage/closure</span> are briefly described below. It is important to address the underlying etiology prior to performing the definitive procedure. </p><p>If the wound is relatively small, it can be completely excised and closed primarily <span class=\"nowrap\">(sutures/staples)</span> provided there is no to minimal skin tension. An understanding of appropriate tension and blood supply is paramount to allow for healing. In a previously infected wound, we avoid placing absorbable sutures deeply within the wound. In this situation, vertical mattress sutures may help bring the deep and superficial spaces together. </p><p>Larger or more complicated wounds may require graft or flap coverage. Procedures that provide coverage to the chronic wound are listed below and discussed in more detail in the linked topics. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-thickness skin graft &ndash; Split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs), also called partial-thickness grafts, are autologous <span class=\"nowrap\">epidermal/dermal</span> grafts. Chronic wounds with a good bed of granulation tissue and without exposed tendon or bone are good candidates for skin grafting. STSGs may be complicated by secondary contracture and should be avoided in areas around joint surfaces. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes#H713392056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;, section on 'Split-thickness skin grafting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full-thickness skin grafts &ndash; Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) are autologous epidermal and full-thickness dermal grafts. These grafts have a decreased incidence of secondary contracture. FTSG is appropriate when a thicker autograft is necessary, such as for deeper wounds or in areas that require more durable tissue (eg, foot). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes#H713392063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;, section on 'Full-thickness skin grafting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Xenografts/allografts</span> &ndash; If an autologous graft is not possible, a xenograft or allograft can be used. One strategy is to use a xenograft or allograft to build up a dermal tissue layer prior to STSG application. A xenograft or allograft will be replaced by the host tissue over time. There are a variety of <span class=\"nowrap\">xenografts/allografts</span> that serve different purposes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63852 \">table 2</a>). Porcine epidermis can be applied to the wound surface as a litmus test to ensure that adequate debridement was performed prior to the definitive <span class=\"nowrap\">closure/coverage</span> procedure, or it can be used as a biologic dressing when there is low confidence in patient compliance. Other xenografts, including bovine collagen, can be used to cover deeper soft tissue defects to form a neodermis in preparation to receive a split-thickness skin graft. Allografts can be used for the same purpose. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local tissue flaps &ndash; Local tissue rearrangement is useful in many circumstances when primary closure is not possible. These techniques involve recruitment of skin from surrounding areas and transposing it into the defect to allow for closure. Blood supply to the flap must be preserved. Common local tissue flaps include V-to-Y advancement, rotation flaps, and advancement flaps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction#H2701269427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pedicled flaps &ndash; Pedicled flaps are useful when muscle or fascia is needed to cover a large wound or deep wound that has exposed tendon or bone. The blood supply to the harvested muscle must be preserved, and the flap is rotated to cover the wound defect. Pedicled flaps include expendable muscles, such as the abductor hallucis muscle flap for coverage of medial foot or ankle defects, or the hemigastrocnemius muscle flap to cover knee defects. Another common flap is the soleus flap for coverage of midtibial defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction#H3640125597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Pedicled'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free tissue transfers &ndash; Free tissue transfer is an important technique for closure of larger soft tissue defects that may not be amenable to pedicled or local advancement flaps. The muscle or fascia is harvested, with or without the overlying skin, along its vascular pedicle.

Recurrence of the wound at the same site or development of wounds at another location can occur after initial healing, especially in high-risk patients.

For patients who require operative debridement, or incision and drainage for infection, initial empiric antibiotic therapy is transitioned to more specific treatment based upon the results and sensitivities of intraoperative cultures. Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be needed, particularly for the treatment of osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The wound dressing is protective, reducing the risk for trauma or infection. The wound should be lightly wrapped with a bulky dry gauze bandage, avoiding excess pressure that could aggravate ischemia. Following revascularization, the wound should be monitored closely for signs of healing or for tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">necrosis/drainage</span> that may indicate a need for further debridement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454397\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic orthopedic wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large soft tissue defects of the extremities are often the result of trauma and are frequently accompanied by bony fractures. When traumatic wounds become chronic, wound coverage options are dictated by the severity of the initial injury and the anatomic location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For traumatic wounds that required internal fixation, the chronicity of the wound may be due to an underlying bone infection (osteomyelitis) or biofilm on a screw, plate, anchor, or heavy suture. Thus, removal of affected materials will be necessary for definitive closure. Bone infection requires resection of the infected segment, long-term antibiotics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of antibiotic-impregnated cement. The skeletal framework must be addressed to provide stability of the overlying soft tissue envelope. Treatment of chronic or subacute osteomyelitis can occur over many months with standard antibiotic treatment regimens lasting typically six weeks, following a period of time off antibiotics, at which time bone culture is repeated. If the repeat culture or aspirate is negative, definitive soft tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">closure/coverage</span> can proceed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Total joint implants pose a difficult problem. Expeditious soft tissue coverage or closure over noninfected joint implants or internal fixation is important. Infected internal fixation constructs and joint implants may require removal with subsequent reimplantation once the infection is resolved. Typically, these problems require pedicled flaps or free tissue transfers for definitive coverage.

Rarely, large defects are the result of traumatic injury (eg, shotgun blast).</p><p>If the wound is small and the fascia is intact, local wound care with bedside incision and drainage may be all that is needed. Negative pressure wound therapy can aid the closure of clean abdominal wounds. For wounds that are larger, those that have drainage, and those with abdominal wall necrosis, surgical debridement and sequential second-look procedures are more optimal for achieving definitive closure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101881\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101881 \">algorithm 2</a>).

The wound was treated with open dressings until a bed of granulation tissue was present, after which a xenograft was initially placed to ensure that a skin graft would take.

Sacral, ischial, and trochanteric wounds occur primarily in patients who are wheelchair- or bed-bound. Heel pressure ulcers can also occur in patients who are in bed for prolonged periods of time without offloading devices to the heel. The treatment of pressure ulcers depends upon the stage of the ulcer. The root cause of the pressure-induced chronic wound must be identified and addressed. If nothing has changed about the patient's immobile state, surgical intervention is likely to fail. Prior to surgical flap closure, nutrition must be optimized and the affected surfaces offloaded. For wounds in the perineal region, stool and urinary diversion are a necessary adjunct to care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Wound management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45051232\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulcerated and fungating malignancy-related wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The palliative treatment of malignancy-related (eg, post radiation therapy) or ulcerating or fungating malignant wounds represents a clinical challenge without evidence-based guidelines or established protocols. The clinician should establish goals for wound management with the patient. Although symptom management strategies for comfort may work in tandem with healing interventions with the goal of eventual wound closure, it is important to recognize when efforts toward wound closure may become unrealistic or burdensome for the patient. </p><p>Topical wound care and specific dressings should be tailored to the individual wound and patient needs, and the physician should appreciate that proper wound management can make a great deal of difference to the patient and influence his or her ability to comfortably receive guests, participate in public events, and assist with activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. Simple wound care such as washing with soap and water and light debridement can be helpful. Often, dressings, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> or Dakin solution, are used to aid in odor management. (See <a href=\"#H45051304\" class=\"local\">'Local care of chronic wounds'</a> above.) </p><p>If feasible, palliative oncologic approaches such as appropriate chemotherapy or radiation therapy can also aid in decreasing tumor burden. If consistent with the goals of care, surgical management may be considered. Surgical options for ulcerated and fungating malignancy-related wounds include surgical resection with appropriate flap or graft reconstruction. Resection and closure may be especially helpful to maintain function for malignant wounds in certain areas of the body, such as in the extremities or groin. However, the decision to operate in such cases must be individualized and include careful consideration of the risks and potential benefits of surgery in the context of the overall disease status and burden as well as the individual patient's goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H549034667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Establishing goals of care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The pictures in the figure show the management of a patient with a chronic wound following excision and radiation treatment for invasive squamous carcinoma of the left lower extremity five years before presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F105179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105179 \">picture 11</a>).

Clearance of biofilm, which is also particularly common in venous stasis wounds, is important prior to definitive coverage or closure. Clearance of biofilm is suggested when there is no odor, no discolored drainage, and the wound bed is pink with granulation tissue. Venous ulcers can be very large or even circumferential around the extremity. Thus, surgical intervention often includes the use of skin grafts. Graft adherence is a good sign that biofilm has been eradicated.</p><p>Compression therapy is necessary after surgical intervention, including long-term compression therapy to prevent recurrence. Ablation of axial veins or perforating veins may be needed to eliminate underlying superficial venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Wound healing normally progresses at a sustained, measureable rate. A chronic state is defined by some as a less than 15 percent reduction of the surface area of the wound over one week, or less than 50 percent reduction over one month. (See <a href=\"#H45052022\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local care of chronic wounds includes debridement and proper wound dressings. Local treatment should also be directed toward dealing with the most troublesome chronic wound problems that affect the patient physically and emotionally, such as odor, bleeding, itching, excess exudate, pain, and minimizing infection. Adjuncts to wound healing may include negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, provided there are no contraindications for their use.
