Conversely, children with neurodevelopmental problems, learning differences, or behavior problems may be at heightened risk for sleep problems compared with the general pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p>Clinicians should incorporate questions about sleep into routine health assessment for children of all ages because parents may not volunteer information about their child's sleep, or may not appreciate the potential relationship between sleep problems and daytime behavior. Sleep problems present most commonly in the outpatient setting, but the hospitalized child may develop sleep problems during an acute illness, or chronic sleep disorders may come to medical attention during hospitalization. </p><p>Children with sleep disorders may present with different symptoms than adults. As an example, in contrast with adults, most children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are not obese, and many children present with daytime attentional or behavioral problems rather than overt sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Even within the pediatric age group, the clinical manifestations of sleep problems may vary by age and developmental level. For example, a school-aged child with excessive sleepiness may exhibit motor overactivity, inattentiveness, irritability, or oppositional behavior rather than overt sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Sleep problems such as difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (insomnia) may coexist with anxiety or depression in the adolescent, and may worsen certain medical or psychiatric problems.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the approach to taking a structured sleep history, provide an overview of specific sleep problems that may present during childhood, and explain indications for further diagnostic testing. Specific sleep disorders are discussed in more detail in other topic reviews: &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related movement disorders in childhood&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE SLEEP HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough sleep and medical history, guided by an understanding of normal sleep physiology, provides the foundation for diagnosis and management of sleep problems. A variety of checklists and questionnaires are available and may supplement the history. As an example, BEARS is a screening acronym that prompts a clinician to inquire about five sleep areas (B = Bedtime Issues, E = Excessive daytime sleepiness, A = Night awakenings, R = Regularity and duration of sleep, S = Sleep disordered breathing [or Snoring]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94931 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This type of screen can help identify patients who should be evaluated with a more detailed sleep history. There is no substitute for a thorough sleep and medical history by a knowledgeable clinician. </p><p>The sleep history is most contributory when it is structured, detailed, and systematic. The clinician should evaluate the <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> schedule, difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, abnormal movements or behavior during sleep, presence of snoring, and daytime accompaniments (eg, sleepiness, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, or irritability). Once the chief sleep complaint is identified, the history can focus on details that distinguish among disorders in that category (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chief sleep complaint'</a> below). The history should include details about the duration and frequency of the problem, temporal profile of onset (abrupt, gradual, intermittent), and degree of variability from night to night. The clinician should note what interventions or strategies have been tried and whether medications have been used. </p><p>Because parents are generally asleep during the night, they may struggle to provide a full history, as they may witness only portions of nighttime events. Some parents generate diaries or logs of sleep problems, and the widespread availability of home video cameras and smartphones have increased the opportunity for physicians to observe episodes of abnormal movement or behavior. </p><p>Completion of a sleep log during the two weeks prior to evaluation may provide important information regarding the <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> pattern and nocturnal events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108025\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef108025 \">form 1</a>). The log should include bed time, time of sleep onset, awakenings, rise time, nocturnal events, feeding pattern, naps, perceived quality of sleep, degree of alertness or sleepiness during the day, and observations regarding nocturnal events and medical or psychological stressors. The child's sleep patterns can then be compared with typical sleep patterns for his or her age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>), although it should be recognized that the average sleep time of children in a given age group varies by as much as two hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-physiology-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep physiology in children&quot;, section on 'Maturation of sleep architecture'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHIEF SLEEP COMPLAINT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history begins with asking the parent or child to identity the chief complaint related to sleep. Despite the many ways children may experience sleep problems, most complaints can be distilled into one (or more) of four categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snoring or other breathing problems during sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal movements or behaviors before or during sleep </p><p/><p>The sleep history should always assess for difficulties in each of these areas. However, the main focus of the history depends on the nature of the chief complaint. The main diagnostic considerations in each of these categories are outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULTY INITIATING OR MAINTAINING SLEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A useful way to gather history on a child with difficulty initiating sleep is to review the child's pattern of activity, hour by hour, from the point of arrival home from school or daycare until bedtime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral contributors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleeplessness, or more specifically difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (insomnia) often has behavioral roots, especially in young children. The problem can be clarified by evaluating the sleep schedule, sleeping environment, and bedtime routines. When problems are identified, the provider can advise the parent on how to modify the routine to improve sleep habits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pre-sleep activities</strong> &mdash; The clinician should record specific times of activities, including periods of exercise or competitive sports, homework times, dinner time, and whether and when the child routinely views television or plays electronic games. Use of electronic devices and social media appear to be important contributors to delayed sleep onset, whereas spending time with family may be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One study suggests that sedentary activity during the day is associated with increased sleep latency (ie, more difficulty falling asleep), whereas physical activity reduces sleep latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The effects of sedentary activities or sports also depend on the timing of the activities, and vary between individual children. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bedtime routine</strong> &mdash; The clinician should discuss the bedtime routine, including the consistency with which parents adhere to schedules, how stalling is addressed, and where the child falls asleep. Patterns that are often associated with delayed sleep onset include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stimulating activities are readily available in the sleep environment (such as television sets, laptop computers or tablets, cell phones, or video games in the bedroom).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of one or both parents as the child falls asleep. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Siblings or other children in the bedroom, or other disruptive environmental circumstances (eg, a loud or unsafe neighborhood). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased attention from the parents in response to a child's stalling behavior at bedtime, which inadvertently promotes the behavior. To avoid this, parents can establish a consistent response that extinguishes the unwanted behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;, section on 'Bedtime routines'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Response to nighttime awakenings</strong> &mdash; When children experience nighttime awakenings, the parents' response can promote or extinguish the behavior. As an example, excessive parental attention in response to nighttime awakenings (including routinely allowing the child to switch beds) may perpetuate the problem. The clinician should assess whether the parents' response to nighttime awakenings is likely to reinforce the behavior, and should offer advice on how to reverse this pattern. For healthy toddlers and older infants, habitual nighttime feedings may disrupt sleep and are unnecessary. Clinicians should inquire about nighttime feedings and offer guidance on eliminating these when appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children#H3450031314\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;, section on 'Young children with behavioral insomnia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209057042\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific sleep disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific sleep disorders may be responsible for the insomnia in some cases and warrant specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, which is a common cause of difficulty initiating sleep in adolescents and is characterized by a shift in sleep and wake time relative to the patient's desired or required sleep schedule.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children#H27172885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;, section on 'Nightmare disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3077154714\"><span class=\"h2\">Other contributors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following problems contribute to insomnia in some children. In such cases, the insomnia is unlikely to respond to behavioral therapy alone until these issues are addressed. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial dysfunction</strong> &mdash; Psychosocial dysfunction may cause or present as a sleeping problem. Conversely, children's sleeping problems can contribute to household and marital stress. The clinician should probe the psychosocial history, including the presence of marital discord, use of alcohol or drugs by household members, and any indications of child abuse. In some cases, it may be necessary to interview the child alone to get a reliable history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anxiety or depression</strong> &mdash; Anxiety (including separation anxiety) and depression are common causes of insomnia in children. All children have fears at some point in their lives, and these may interfere with sleep. If the fears are persistent and consistently interfere with functioning (ie, sleep), evaluation for a specific phobia or generalized anxiety disorder may be warranted (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fears and phobias in children and adolescents&quot;</a>). The prevalence of depression is about 2 percent among school-aged children and rises sharply during adolescence. In addition to insomnia, symptoms include depressed or irritable mood, diminished interest or pleasure (anhedonia), change in appetite or weight status, psychomotor agitation or retardation (eg, talking or moving more slowly than is usual for them), fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired concentration, or recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concomitant medical problems</strong> &mdash; The clinician should identify chronic medical problems that may influence sleep, including chronic or recurrent pain, symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux, breathing problems during wakefulness or sleep, and the medication history. Such medical problems may disrupt sleep because of discomfort or because of medical interventions (eg, medications, breathing treatments, or feedings) that are given during the night. Some medications, including stimulants used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may affect sleep latency and continuity. (See <a href=\"#H2462444258\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant medical problems'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2877031827\" class=\"local\">'Medications, caffeine, and alcohol'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For evaluation of the child with excessive daytime sleepiness, the history is directed at identification of potential causes. If parents are not aware of age-appropriate norms for nighttime sleep and daytime napping, they may fail to recognize poor sleep hygiene or chronic sleepiness in their child. Furthermore, a child with insufficient sleep may not appear sleepy to parents or clinicians. Instead, the child may exhibit attentional difficulties due to unsuspected sleepiness, hyperactivity secondary to efforts to stay awake, or aggressive and disruptive behavior that reflects inability of a sleep-deprived frontal cortex to regulate emotion normally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Excessive sleepiness is of particular concern in older adolescents because of the known association between drowsy driving and accidents. Driving while drowsy can have the same consequences as driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol including reduced attentiveness, delayed reaction times, and impaired decision-making. Young men between 16 and 24 years of age are most at risk for having an accident while driving drowsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The American Academy of&nbsp;Sleep&nbsp;Medicine (AASM) has advocated for policies and procedures that will reduce drowsy driving such as inclusion of material on drowsy driving in state drivers' education manuals and curricula, and on drivers' licensing examinations and other initiatives. Physicians involved with evaluation and management of older adolescents who drive should incorporate appropriate education and recommendations about drowsy driving into their management plan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management#H3585313850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drowsy driving: Risks, evaluation, and management&quot;, section on 'High-risk populations'</a>.)</p><p>Sleepiness should be differentiated from chronic fatigue, which often involves somatic complaints, such as weakness or easy fatigability, malaise, nonrestorative sleep patterns, and depression or other emotional disturbances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1354923773\"><span class=\"h2\">Insufficient sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insufficient sleep is the leading cause of daytime sleepiness in children and teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The sleep requirement for children and teenagers is age-dependent and can show a rather wide range, especially in infants. For optimal health, daytime functioning and development, the following sleep times are recommended on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These consensus recommendations were made by the AASM and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and are very similar to those of the National Sleep Foundation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>). Of note, these consensus recommendations derive largely from studies that collected parent reports, rather than objective measures: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants 4 to 12 months &ndash; 12 to 16 hours (including naps)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toddlers 1 to 2 years &ndash; 11 to 14 hours (including naps)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 to 5 year old children &ndash; 10 to 13 hours (including naps) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>6 to 12 year old children &ndash; 9 to 12 hours </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teens 13 to 18 years &ndash; 8 to 10 hours &#160;</p><p/><p>AASM did not make specific recommendations for newborns 0 to 3 months of age because of the wide range of variation in sleep duration and patterns; infants in this age group generally sleep 14 to 17 hours daily (including naps). Insufficient sleep is often a consequence of poor sleep hygiene (which contributes to insufficient sleep time), failure of the parents or older children to prioritize sleep, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medication side effects. Strategies to improve sleep habits in children are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52760 \">table 2</a>) and discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1054120684\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder involves a circadian rhythm disturbance characterized by a shift in sleep and wake time relative to the patient's desired or required sleep schedule. It is particularly common among adolescents and young adults, and results in complaints of difficulty waking in the morning and difficulty initiating sleep at the targeted time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H989604567\"><span class=\"h2\">Narcolepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with narcolepsy often experience severe sleepiness, including falling asleep during meal times and conversation, sports events, or social activities. The disorder is most often diagnosed during adolescence, but is increasingly recognized in younger children. Academic failure is common. Unique features that may or may not be present initially are cataplexy (sudden bilateral loss of tone, often precipitated by a sudden emotion such as laughter), sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid, dreamlike imagery at sleep onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/8,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19-22</a>]. Cataplexy should be differentiated from atonic seizures, syncope, vestibular disorders, transient ischemic attacks, and behaviorally based loss of postural tone. The diagnostic evaluation for narcolepsy includes a focused history and physical examination, polysomnography (PSG), and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Multiple sleep latency test'</a> below). Narcolepsy is discussed in detail separately.

The sleepiness is often less obvious in children compared with adults with OSA. Complaints of excessive snoring or abnormal breathing during sleep are usually, but not always, present. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periodic limb movement disorder</strong> &ndash; Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by periodic episodes of repetitive limb movements during sleep. It may present with daytime sleepiness. Periodic limb movements and arousals that occur with them can also be associated with transient increases in blood pressure. Affected children also may complain of symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS), which is a closely associated disorder. (See <a href=\"#H3434691618\" class=\"local\">'Periodic or rhythmic movements'</a> below.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying medical conditions</strong> &ndash; Many medical conditions may be associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished alertness, fatigue, or related complaints that can be challenging to distinguish. Such conditions include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any chronic disease &ndash; eg, including anemia, cardiac disease, malignancy, or metabolic problems </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acquired central nervous system (CNS) disorders </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>After traumatic brain injury (concussion) or in association with meningitis, encephalitis, or certain toxic exposures (eg, carbon monoxide and heavy metals). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Increased intracranial pressure, due to hydrocephalus or mass lesions in the region of the third ventricle or posterior hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Headaches, diplopia, or papilledema may be present. Further evaluation with neuroimaging is indicated for children with suspected mass lesions.

It typically presents with complaints of snoring or other sounds, such as snorting or gasping. It is often associated with neurobehavioral symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and irritability. Excessive daytime sleepiness is less obvious than in adults with OSA, but may be evident on specific questioning. Children whose initial screening reveals any of these symptoms, or those with marked adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity, warrant a more detailed clinical evaluation. The detailed evaluation typically is performed by a sleep medicine specialist or otolaryngologist, and usually includes polysomnography (PSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Alternatively, the referring provider may be able to arrange for a PSG if a facility with experience in pediatric PSG is available.

When the airway obstruction is severe, the snoring often occurs in any sleeping position. However, in contrast with adults with OSA, children with OSA may not snore, and they may not experience recurrent awakenings or arousals with episodes of obstruction. Episodes of snoring, gasping, apnea, and sudden arousal during airway obstruction are often observed more frequently in the final one-third of the night because upper airway obstruction is often worse during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Nocturnal enuresis occurs more frequently in children with OSA than in children without OSA, and enuresis may improve in association with treatment of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

The term rhythmic movement <strong>disorder</strong> is used if the movements have or are likely to have significant consequences such as self-injury or interference with normal sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typical manifestations are body rocking, head rolling (side to side), or head banging, sometimes accompanied by rhythmic humming or inarticulate chanting. The movements often begin immediately prior to sleep onset and are sustained into light sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The distinctive character of rhythmic movements allows a clinical diagnosis in most cases, although in a few cases with atypical features, further investigation may be required to distinguish these from sleep-related epilepsy.

The movements usually involve extension of the great toe and partial flexion of the ankle, knee, and sometimes hip. When these movements are associated with repetitive partial arousals or awakenings, sleep is fragmented. In addition to the movements, affected children have daytime problems, often including diminished attentiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is significant overlap between PLMD and restless leg syndrome (RLS) in both children and adults. RLS is characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. The symptoms begin or worsen during rest or inactivity, are relieved by movement, and occur exclusively or predominantly in the evening or night. Children with RLS or PLMD often have depressed serum ferritin levels, indicating reduced iron stores, and in this case the disorder may improve with iron supplementation.

Occasionally, sleep-related epilepsy can present with similar clinical features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parasomnias</strong> &ndash; Parasomnias are episodic and complex behaviors that intrude into sleep. The most common parasomnias in children are sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and sleep terrors, which occur upon partial arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. They are benign and most common in young children but occasionally occur in older children or adolescents. Common triggers include sleep deprivation and other sleep disorders, such as OSA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Parasomnias usually are easily identified by a description or video record of the behavior and its timing. Rarely, certain types of sleep-related epilepsy can mimic parasomnias, but usually can be distinguished by clinical characteristics, or with nocturnal EEG if needed. Assessment includes gathering clinical history on common triggers such as insufficient sleep, or symptoms of OSA or RLS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleepwalking-and-other-parasomnias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleepwalking and other parasomnias in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep-related epilepsy</strong> &ndash; Sleep-related epilepsy (nocturnal seizures) may be generalized or focal (also known as partial or localization-related epilepsy). A generalized tonic clonic seizure arising out of sleep is usually obvious by history and not easy to confuse with a sleep disorder; the seizure involves bilateral tonic clonic movements, often with tongue biting or urinary incontinence, postictal drowsiness and confusion. It may be difficult for parents to provide a full description of nocturnal seizures since they may directly observe only the latter portion of the event rather than the beginning of the event. Assessment may include PSG with expanded EEG montage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Benign (childhood) epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as benign rolandic epilepsy, is one of the more common epilepsy syndromes in childhood. It is an age-dependent focal epilepsy of unknown etiology with a peak incidence in children between seven and nine years of age. The characteristic focal seizure type involves initial hemifacial clonic twitching accompanied by hypersalivation, evolving to a focal hemi-tonic-clonic seizure. The seizure tends to occur during nocturnal sleep, often in the early morning hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes#H787554864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes&quot;, section on 'Benign focal epilepsies of childhood'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy typically occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents and is characterized by the triad of myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and absence seizures (also called petit mal). The seizures characteristically occur upon awakening, often in the early morning, or in association with sleep deprivation. By contrast, periodic limb movements occur during sleep, and are more likely in the first half of the night.

Events are highly stereotypic (ie, the same behavior pattern recurs) and are often brief but clustered or frequent during the night. Occasionally these types of seizures may be difficult to distinguish from arousal (NREM) parasomnias (sleep walking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) because both may be associated with altered behavior, responsiveness, and automatisms, and because attempts to awaken a child during a parasomnia may precipitate a lengthy period of confusion (ie, partial arousal) that is reminiscent of a postictal state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A key feature that differentiates temporal and frontal lobe seizures from parasomnias is the time of occurrence in the sleep period, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188 \">table 6</a>). NREM parasomnias typically occur in association with deeper stages of NREM sleep in the first one-third of the night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Board-certified sleep medicine physicians are generally trained to address sleep disorders in patients of all ages. After training, many though not all sleep medicine specialists continue to include children in their practices.

Existing literature does not indicate which referral serves best, and local resources and access to care may vary. If polysomnography (PSG) is indicated, this can be arranged by the sleep physician. Alternatively, the referring provider may be able to arrange directly for a PSG if a facility with experience in pediatric PSG is available; children with abnormal results of PSG or other significant sleep problems can then be referred to the appropriate specialist. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep (insomnia) &ndash; In some cases, the primary care clinician may provide counseling to improve sleep hygiene.

It is performed following nocturnal PSG and consists of five 20-minute nap opportunities at two-hour intervals across the day. The test is based on the concept that the speed with which one falls asleep is an indication of the severity of sleepiness. The MSLT is also used more specifically to assess for narcolepsy when the clinical history suggests this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>During the MSLT, a sleep latency time of less than five minutes is markedly abnormal and supports a diagnosis of narcolepsy or severe sleep deprivation; affected individuals also tend to enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep quickly. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (ICSD-3), requires a mean sleep latency of less than eight minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods as part of the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In prepubertal children, data suggest that mean sleep latency values of 8 to 15 minutes (rather than less than eight minutes) on the MSLT may be suggestive of pathological sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Abnormal entry into REM sleep may occur in disorders other than narcolepsy that are associated with fragmented nocturnal sleep, such as OSA, sleep deprivation, and as a rebound phenomenon after REM-suppressing medications are stopped abruptly.

Actigraphy has been validated against PSG and shown to provide a reasonable estimate for patterns of sleep versus wakefulness in children and adults. The advantage of actigraphy over polysomnography is that it captures multiple days of data from the home environment. Actigraphy is typically used by sleep medicine specialists as part of a comprehensive characterization of <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> patterns and to monitor response to interventions.

Clinicians should incorporate questions about sleep into their routine health assessment of children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A structured sleep history assesses the <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> schedule, difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, presence of snoring, abnormal movements or behavior during sleep, and daytime accompaniments (eg, sleepiness, inattentiveness, or irritability). The history should include details about the duration and frequency of the problem, temporal profile of onset (abrupt, gradual, intermittent), and degree of variability from night to night. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the sleep history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep (sleeplessness or insomnia) often have behavioral origins in young children. These issues can be identified by evaluating the sleep schedule, sleeping environment, and bedtime routines. Other causes or contributors in all age groups include psychosocial stressors, underlying medical problems, and anxiety or depression. Specific sleep disorders that may cause sleep-onset insomnia include restless legs syndrome (RLS) and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, which is common in adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes of daytime sleepiness include insufficient nocturnal sleep compared with the average sleep requirements for the age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106597 \">figure 1</a>), poor sleep hygiene, and medication side effects. Less common but important causes include narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Excessive daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OSA in children typically presents with snoring, other noisy breathing, daytime behavioral problems, or excessive daytime sleepiness. If these symptoms are present, or if a child has significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity, a more detailed clinical evaluation is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal movements or behaviors may be observed in a variety of sleep disorders, including rhythmic movement disorder, parasomnias (sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors), and nocturnal seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107731 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1058593606\" class=\"local\">'Movements or behaviors during sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rhythmic movements of the head, neck, or trunk associated with sleep are common and likely developmental (physiologic) in infants and young children. They are most common in infants and toddlers, and generally resolve spontaneously by five years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3434691618\" class=\"local\">'Periodic or rhythmic movements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RLS and periodic limb movements in sleep are relatively common in children and are associated with diminished attentiveness. Children with RLS often have depressed serum ferritin levels, indicating reduced iron stores, and in this case the disorder may improve with iron supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H3434691618\" class=\"local\">'Periodic or rhythmic movements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compared with parasomnias, nocturnal seizures are more likely to recur during the same night, have stereotypic behaviors that look exactly the same each time, and occur randomly through the night (rather than in the first one-third of the night) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1886214148\" class=\"local\">'Complex movements or behaviors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some children, evaluation with overnight polysomnography (PSG) may be required to confirm a specific sleep disorder (eg, OSA or narcolepsy) or to titrate positive airway pressure. PSG is not routinely indicated for children with insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disturbances, uncomplicated parasomnias, or behavioral sleep problems.
