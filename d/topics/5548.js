Large population studies have described adverse psychiatric outcomes associated with such early life trauma including depression, suicidality, auditory hallucinations, substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and personality disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/70-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167850254\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited systematically collected data on the course of dissociative amnesia. </p><p>Most patients who present with dissociative amnesia have a history of one or more traumatic experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Longer gaps in memory have been seen more commonly subsequent to chronic childhood physical and sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a retrospective study of over 13,000 HMO enrollees, the duration of sexual abuse experienced during childhood was associated with greater severity, frequency, and violence of the abuse. A longer period of amnesia of aspects of early life history, up to inability to recall years of the person&rsquo;s early life, was associated with greater severity of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. </p><p>In our clinical experience, many patients with the acute, overt form of dissociative amnesia respond rapidly to intervention such as removal from a traumatic environment (eg, combat) and provision of emergency, clinical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subgroup of these patients, particularly those with dissociative fugue, may have prolonged, refractory dissociative amnesia for life history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identity. Our clinical experience suggests that these individuals are usually very impaired interpersonally and occupationally.</p><p>Our clinical experience suggests that the course of dissociative amnesia during treatment may be positively associated with better social and occupational functioning, the presence of social supports, and lack of major, chronic comorbidities such as refractory substance abuse, eating disorders, and severe health problems. (See <a href=\"#H2357208276\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p>Among patients with dissociative amnesia and a history of childhood sexual or physical abuse, studies have found that recall of previously dissociated memory frequently occurs outside of therapeutic settings. Memories of the abuse were triggered by a variety of stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,53,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,53,65</a>], including a patient&rsquo;s own child reaching an age at which the patient was abused, a patient&rsquo;s child being abused, media accounts of trauma or abuse, death of an abusive parent, experiences of contemporary trauma (even minor ones), a variety of sensory cues, and feeling safe in one's life situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517949890\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical assessment of a patient with dissociative amnesia would typically identify a pattern of deficits in autobiographical memory with normal cognitive functioning, intact memory for everyday information, facts, and skills, normal orientation to current circumstances, and normal interpersonal grasp of the interview. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment, including a mental status exam, and a medical history and physical exam, should be done to rule out medical conditions, substance use disorders, and cognitive disorders such as dementias and delirium prior to diagnosing dissociative amnesia. Brain imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an electroencephalogram may be needed in patients with focal findings on the neurologic exam.</p><p>In more complex or ambiguous cases, a detailed review of the patient&rsquo;s medical and psychiatric records may be needed as well as consultation with corollary sources of the patient&rsquo;s history to rule out factors such as substance abuse, factitious or malingered amnesia, and co-morbid brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissociative-amnesia-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p>Questions useful for testing memory in cases of suspected dissociative amnesia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have gaps in your memory of your life? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you missing parts of your memory for your life history? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you missing memories of some important events in your life, for example, weddings, birthdays, graduations, pregnancies, birth of children?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you remember some parts of your life better than others? As an example, when you were growing up, do you recall home better or school better? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you &ldquo;lose&rdquo; periods of time or have gaps in your experience of time? What is the longest period of time you have lost, eg, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever have blackouts or blank spells? </p><p/><p>A careful sequential history may be needed to identity periods of amnesia, to distinguish between dissociation and substance use, and sort out other more clinically complex clinical presentations. A more systematic inquiry may include asking for the patient&rsquo;s first memory, then asking for subsequent memories in turn. This may reveal significant gaps in the person&rsquo;s autobiographical memory. In patients who appear to have problems with memory for childhood, the clinician can ask the names of the patient&rsquo;s teachers and schools. Patients with dissociative amnesia may not recall many of their teachers in early school years, or even what occurred at school.</p><p>It is helpful to ask patients for specific, detailed examples when the patient gives a positive answer one of these queries. The patient should be asked if he or she was intoxicated on alcohol or drugs during some or all of the time that they report memory problems. Drug, alcohol, and dissociative memory problems may co-exist in the same person, and some dissociative amnesia patients may also have cognitive disorders related to traumatic brain injury. Some patients with dissociative amnesia rationalize their amnesia by ascribing it to substance abuse. </p><p>Patients should be assessed for other dissociative symptoms including (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis#H375332765\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissociative aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Concepts and definitions'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depersonalization &mdash; Detachment or estrangement from one&rsquo;s self</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Derealization &mdash; The sense that the external world is strange or unreal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous trance experiences </p><p/><p>Dissociative amnesia may be associated with memory that is derealized, ie, the person does not experience memory as first hand, but as something that they &ldquo;know&rdquo; about, as if they read it in a book.

In most cases, a careful chronologic history of memory impairment and of periods of intoxication can help distinguish between substance-induced amnesia and dissociative amnesia. A period of abstinence for weeks or (in cases of more severe or longer-lasting substance use) months may be needed prior to assessment of the patient for dissociative amnesia. </p><p>Co-occurring substance abuse can complicate diagnosis in some patients with dissociative amnesia. It is common for patients with both disorders to ascribe their memory problems to substance-related &quot;black outs&quot;. However, a careful history may reveal that at least some of the autobiographical memory problems relate to periods of sobriety (eg, in childhood or adolescence before substance use began). </p><p>Amnesia from chronic substance <span class=\"nowrap\">abuse/dependence</span> can usually be identified by presence of additional signs and symptoms.

Patients with the disorder cannot recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. (See <a href=\"#H167850204\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 12 month prevalence of dissociative disorders in the US general population has been estimated to be 1 percent in males and 2.6 percent in females. (See <a href=\"#H167850212\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the pathogenesis of dissociative amnesia is unknown, genetic and environmental factors &mdash; particularly trauma &mdash; are believed to play a role in the development of the disorder. Dissociative amnesia has been strongly associated with a history of traumatic experiences including childhood physical or sexual abuse, military combat, or natural disasters. (See <a href=\"#H167850219\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissociative amnesia typically manifests with relatively large groups of autobiographical memories, perceptions, and associated affects that have become unavailable. Deficits are seen in episodic and semantic, but usually not in procedural memory. The ability to remember new factual information is generally intact, as are general cognitive functioning and language capacity. (See <a href=\"#H167850247\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517949934\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with overt dissociative amnesia usually present with a dramatic, profound loss of memory for personal history, often accompanied by amnesia for personal identity. In patients with the covert form of the disorder, the memory deficit is typically a gap or series of gaps in autobiographical experience that become apparent with careful questioning in the diagnostic interview. (See <a href=\"#H349126885\" class=\"local\">'Overt dissociative amnesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H349127052\" class=\"local\">'Covert dissociative amnesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for dissociative amnesia should rule out medical conditions, substance use disorders (SUD), traumatic brain injury, and cognitive disorders such as the dementias and delirium as the cause of memory problems. Patients with dissociative amnesia may have a co-occurring substance use or mood disorder.
