The differentiation of the small number of patients with life-threatening headaches from the overwhelming majority with benign primary headaches (ie, migraine, tension, or cluster) is an important problem in the ED. Failure to recognize a serious headache can have potentially fatal consequences.</p><p>A careful history and physical examination remain the most important part of the assessment of the headache patient; they enable the clinician to determine whether the patient is at significant risk for a dangerous cause of their symptoms and what additional workup is necessary.</p><p>This topic will discuss how to approach adults presenting with headache in the ED with an emphasis on those components of the history and physical examination that characterize high-risk headaches. A flow chart to help guide this evaluation is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71604%7EEM%2F51917\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71604 graphicRef51917 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).

Such headaches are commonly referred to as secondary to distinguish them from benign intrinsic causes (ie, migraine, cluster, and tension), which are referred to as primary. The following historical features are warning signs to the presence of a secondary headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78567 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sudden onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe persistent headache that reaches maximal intensity within a few <strong>seconds</strong> or <strong>minutes</strong> after the onset of pain warrants aggressive investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), for example, often presents with the abrupt onset of excruciating pain. Other serious etiologies of sudden-onset headache include carotid and vertebral artery dissections, venous sinus thrombosis, pituitary apoplexy, acute angle-closure glaucoma, and hypertensive emergencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61027 \">table 2</a>). In contrast, migraine headaches generally begin with mild to moderate pain and then gradually increase to a maximal level over one to two hours. </p><p>Cluster headache may sometimes be confused with a serious headache, since the pain from a cluster headache can reach full intensity within minutes. However, cluster headache is transient (usually lasting less than one to two hours) and is associated with characteristic ipsilateral autonomic signs, such as tearing or rhinorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, pain may increase gradually with some dangerous causes of headache, such as herpetic or Lyme meningitis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">No similar headaches in the past</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of similar headaches in the past is another finding that suggests a serious disorder. The &quot;first&quot; or &quot;worst headache of my life&quot; is a description that sometimes accompanies an intracranial hemorrhage or central nervous system (CNS) infection. A new or unusual headache in a patient with AIDS or cancer is particularly worrisome, as it suggests an intracranial lesion or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On the other hand, patients suffering from migraine usually have had similar headaches in the past.

Syncope or near syncope is suggestive of SAH. Headache associated with seizure is also concerning for intracranial pathology. Preeclampsia can cause a headache and may present following delivery.

A careful history and physical examination, including measurement of intraocular pressures when warranted, is usually sufficient to determine whether this is the source of pain. Headache associated with visual disturbances may also be associated with giant cell arteritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head pain that spreads into the lower neck (ie, occipitonuchal headache) and between the shoulders may indicate meningeal irritation due to either infection or subarachnoid blood; it is not typical of a benign process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some secondary headaches are well localized. As an example, headache from acute narrow angle glaucoma is commonly centered around the involved eye, while headache from temporal arteritis, as implied by its name, can be focused in a temple, although not always. Generally, however, headache location is nonspecific and should not be relied upon for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The headache patient with a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) among first or second-degree relatives is at significantly greater risk of SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathogenesis#H1387172602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Genetic risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should inquire about medication use, particularly anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, and analgesics. Use of anticoagulants or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, increases the risk of intracranial bleeding. Sympathomimetics are also associated with intracranial bleeding. Analgesics can mask severe symptoms or sometimes exacerbate migraine headache through a rebound effect (medication overuse headache). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6723177\"><span class=\"h2\">Illicit drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of illicit drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and other sympathomimetic agents, increase the risk of stroke and intracranial bleeding.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other historical factors to consider when investigating the cause of headache include head trauma, possible toxic exposures (eg, carbon monoxide), and comorbidities known to put patients at higher-risk for critical secondary causes of headache. Such comorbidities include malignancy with a risk of intracranial metastasis and polycystic kidney disease or connective tissue disease, both of which increase the risk of aneurysms with resultant SAH (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>). Jaw claudication suggests temporal arteritis as the cause of headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Comorbidities that adversely affect coagulation increase the risk of headache from dangerous causes. As examples, liver disease or clotting disorders may predispose patients to intracranial bleeding, while hypercoagulable states may increase the risk of stroke or cerebral venous thrombosis. Some regions may have high rates of particular infections that may present with headache as a prominent symptom (eg, Lyme disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several less common headache syndromes associated with specific symptoms or signs may be associated with dangerous underlying etiologies. As examples, headache induced by cough or valsalva may be caused by malignancy or cerebrovascular disease, and headache associated with positional hypotension may be caused by leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with any new focal or nonfocal neurologic abnormality must be evaluated for serious illness. Abnormal findings on neurologic exam remain the single-best clinical predictor of intracranial pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,9</a>]. The findings may be quite subtle, such as slight pupillary asymmetry, unilateral pronator drift, or extensor plantar response, or pronounced, such as unilateral vision loss, ataxia, or seizure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>). Focal neurologic findings can accompany a number of secondary causes of headache, including intracranial hemorrhage, acute narrow angle glaucoma, and carotid or vertebral artery dissection. Nonfocal alterations in mental status more commonly characterize other secondary causes of headache, including SAH, infectious processes such as meningitis, toxins such as carbon monoxide, and metabolic derangements such as hypoxia.</p><p>Neurologic abnormalities can also occur with migraine headaches. As an example, a visual field cut in both eyes within the same hemifield bounded by scintillations is characteristic of migraine with visual aura (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H203275055\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Migraine aura'</a>). However, a focal neurologic deficit should not be assumed to be related to migraine unless similar deficits have occurred with migraine in the past. Any new or atypical focal neurologic deficit is considered a high-risk finding and should be investigated urgently in the emergency department.

Such findings may include scalp or facial lacerations or contusions, hemotympanum, and periorbital or preauricular ecchymosis. Victims of abuse or other violence may not volunteer a history of trauma. Headache caused by a chronic subdural hemorrhage, although likely secondary to distant and perhaps mild trauma, will lack such immediate findings.

One of the tragedies of contemporary emergency care is that those patients with SAH most amenable to treatment are the ones most frequently misdiagnosed at initial presentation. Such patients generally appear less ill and do not have neurologic deficits; misdiagnosis stems from a lack of appreciation of the range of possible presentations of patients with SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Documented cases of herniation following LP have made some clinicians reluctant to perform the procedure without prior imaging in patients suspected of having intracranial pathology. In most such patients, however, LP alone is safe. In one prospective observational study that evaluated the need for cranial CT scan prior to LP, only 3 of 113 consecutive emergency department patients (2.7 percent) in whom an urgent lumbar puncture was thought to be necessary (not only for headache) had a CT abnormality that was a contraindication to LP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Three clinical findings were associated with such an abnormality: papilledema, focal neurologic findings, and altered mental status. Another prospective study evaluating the need for preliminary cranial CT scan in patients with suspected meningitis found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical policy statement on acute headache of the American College of Emergency Physicians gives a class C recommendation (ie, suggestion based upon weak evidence) to the performance of LP without prior neuroimaging in patients without evidence of increased intracranial pressure (ie, papilledema, absent venous pulsations on funduscopy, altered neurologic status, or focal neurologic deficits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An opening pressure should be measured when the LP is performed.</p><p>Treatment with<strong> </strong>antibiotics<strong> must NOT be delayed</strong> in patients with suspected meningitis, regardless of the decision of whether to perform an imaging study. Detailed discussions of the interpretation of head CT and LP results are found elsewhere.

The clearing of blood in CSF collection tubes is <strong>NOT</strong> a reliable means of excluding SAH, unless a late or final collecting tube specimen is normal (ie, red blood cell count approaches zero). Xanthochromia, while useful, is not a foolproof means of diagnosing SAH. Interpretation of the LP is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p>One approach in such cases is to repeat the LP one intervertebral level cephalad to where the initial attempt was made (but no higher than <span class=\"nowrap\">L3/4)</span> or under fluoroscopic guidance. The presence of blood in CSF obtained from two LPs suggests SAH, possibly from a nonaneurysmal cause, while a normal specimen from the repeat LP makes SAH less likely. In cases where suspicion for SAH remains substantial, the head CT is unrevealing, and LP results are difficult to interpret, we recommend admission for further evaluation by neurology or neurosurgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonaneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific laboratory tests can be helpful in evaluating possible causes of severe headache and are generally indicated by the patient's history and examination.

Patients in whom a secondary cause was suspected, but a thorough, appropriate workup was normal, should be treated symptomatically and may be discharged with primary care or neurologic follow-up.

The large majority of these patients will ultimately be diagnosed with either a migraine or cluster headache. Details of migraine and cluster headache treatment are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064 \">table 4</a>).

Few studies are available to guide empiric management of undifferentiated headache in the ED; treatment remains symptom-based and largely nonspecific. Nevertheless, many of the treatments used for acute migraine headaches provide some relief in patients with a severe undifferentiated headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The authors of a systematic review of headache management in the ED propose the use of a parenterally administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a dopamine antagonist (DA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-headache-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Their goal is to relieve pain, and allow the patient to return to baseline mental function without drowsiness. In the United States, this treatment would probably be <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> 30 mg IV and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> 10 mg. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chlorpromazine</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV might be used in place of prochlorperazine.
