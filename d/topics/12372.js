ECT is used mainly to treat severe depression, but is also indicated for patients with other conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, catatonia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><p>There is no question about the efficacy and safety of ECT, which is practiced widely in the United States and the rest of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, it remains controversial and stigmatized because of misinformation and outmoded perceptions about how the treatment is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic provides an overview of ECT.

Initially, physicians induced seizures with medications. In 1938, Italian psychiatrists used an electric current to induce seizures as a treatment for schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ECT quickly spread around Europe and the rest of the world, and was first used in the United States in 1939. Patients suffered bone fractures occasionally and considerable anticipatory anxiety, but advances in anesthesia techniques in the 1950s allowed for the use of general anesthesia and muscle relaxation for ECT, which reduced the incidence of these problems.</p><p>The use of ECT in the United States has fluctuated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Use of ECT declined in the 1970s, and subsequently increased, possibly as a result of greater treatment resistance to pharmacotherapy in depressed patients, increased recognition of the limitations of pharmacotherapy, and better public acceptance. A practice survey from 1988 to 1989 estimated that at least 100,000 patients received ECT annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The typical ECT patient today is relatively affluent and receives ECT in a private sector psychiatric facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. State hospitals rarely offer the treatment, even though many of the patients would meet indications for ECT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action for ECT is unknown, but there are many well-documented changes in the central nervous system:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human and animal studies show that ECT increases release of monoamine neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>]. ECT also enhances monoamine transmission by desensitizing presynaptic adrenergic autoreceptors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neuroendocrine hypothesis suggests that ECT relieves depression by causing the hypothalamus or pituitary gland to release hormones, including prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and endorphins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECT has anticonvulsant properties (perhaps related to neurohormones and enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission), which has led to the suggestion that these properties are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neurotrophic hypothesis suggests that ECT works by increasing neurotrophic signaling and inducing neurogenesis (brain structural plasticity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/2,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-18</a>]. Multiple studies have found that ECT increases brain derived neurotrophic factor and gray matter volume in the hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal lobes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography studies demonstrate decreased metabolic activity in frontal and cingulate cortex after ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECT may change brain connectivity. One functional magnetic resonance imaging study before and after successful treatment with ECT revealed a reduction in global connectivity within the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], whereas another functional magnetic resonance imaging study found increased right hippocampal connectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and a structural study found increased connectivity in dorsal fronto-limbic circuits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative electroencephalogram studies demonstrate increased slow (delta) wave activity in the prefrontal cortex after ECT, which is associated with clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-ECT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the pre-ECT evaluation are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine whether ECT is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55438 \">table 1</a>).

Medical consultation prior to ECT is indicated for most patients 40 years or older, and is frequently obtained in younger patients as well. Particular attention should be paid to any history of cardiopulmonary and central nervous system disease and prior surgeries (with inquiry about type of anesthesia and any complications). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-electroconvulsive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for electroconvulsive therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technique for performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults&quot;, section on 'Electrode placement'</a>.)</p><p>Appropriate physical examination (including dental evaluation) and laboratory evaluation, guided by the relevant history, should be performed.

The ECT psychiatrist, anesthesiologist, or medical consultant should decide which to continue and which to taper and discontinue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotropic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many psychotropic medications may be continued during a course of ECT for their synergistic effect without compromising safety, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>. Morning doses on the day of ECT are given after the patient has recovered from that day's procedure. Anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines often interfere with ECT (eg, decrease seizure duration) and may need to be tapered and discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Antidepressants can improve the efficacy of ECT. A review of 10 systematic reviews, 7 meta-analyses, and 3 practice guidelines found that for depressed patients, a tricyclic may improve the antidepressant effect of ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial assigned depressed patients (n = 319) receiving an acute course of ECT to concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, or placebo. Remission occurred in more patients who received nortriptyline or venlafaxine compared with placebo (63 and 60 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], with a significant difference between nortriptyline and placebo.</p><p>Antidepressants are generally safe to use with ECT and do not affect its tolerability. As an example, a randomized trial of depressed patients receiving an acute course of ECT with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, or placebo found the number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other types of antidepressants are also well tolerated during ECT, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Antipsychotic medications are often continued during ECT and may provide a synergistic antipsychotic effect, especially second-generation antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, antipsychotics generally do not appear to affect the tolerability of ECT. Second-generation antipsychotics and high potency first-generation antipsychotics are thought to be safe. A review found that early reports warned of hypotension and cardiac complications from combining <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> and ECT, but later reports did not substantiate these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nonetheless, combining of low potency, first-generation antipsychotics with ECT should be done cautiously.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> has the potential to increase the adverse cognitive effects of ECT and to prolong the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (which is typically used during ECT to reduce tonic-clonic movements), but these problems are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A review of several case series found that concomitant lithium and ECT is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. We suggest reducing lithium levels below the full therapeutic range at the time of each ECT treatment by withholding one or two doses of lithium prior to each treatment.</p><p>Benzodiazepines should be tapered and discontinued whenever possible during ECT because of their anticonvulsant properties, which can increase seizure threshold, shorten seizure duration, and decrease the intensity of the ECT seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These effects may decrease the clinical efficacy of ECT.</p><p>However, for patients who need to continue their benzodiazepine during ECT, it is reasonable to switch from drugs with long half-lives to one with a short half-life, and withhold the evening dose before each ECT treatment. In addition, small doses of benzodiazepines may not be a problem. Patients who are very anxious about the ECT procedure itself may take a benzodiazepine (eg, 1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> sublingual) 30 to 60 minutes before the treatment. </p><p>Another reasonable alternative for patients who continue their benzodiazepine is to use intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>, which reverses the anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines and is given one to three minutes before anesthetic induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The typical dose of flumazenil is 0.4 to 0.5 mg, but doses up to 1.0 mg may be necessary for patients who have been chronically taking high doses of benzodiazepines. If patients receiving flumazenil manifest symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal within one hour post-ECT, subsequent ECT treatments should be followed by administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (eg, 1 mg).</p><p>Anticonvulsants may interfere with the efficacy of ECT, similar to benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. When anticonvulsants are used for mood stabilization, they generally should be tapered and discontinued prior to ECT.</p><p>Patients with epilepsy should continue their anticonvulsants during a course of ECT. Clinicians should consider reducing the dose if seizures are difficult to elicit, or withholding a dose the evening or night before the ECT treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other drugs</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular medications &ndash; Patients should receive their routine antihypertensive (other than diuretics) and antianginal medications with a small sip of water approximately two hours before ECT.

Several depression rating scales are available; we suggest that clinicians use clinician-administered rating scales rather than patient self report scales because the validity of self report scales can be compromised by confusion and amnesia from ECT. The scale should be administered at baseline, weekly during the course of ECT, and when the ECT course is completed. The most commonly used clinician administered scale is the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F72220%7EPSYCH%2F60363%7EPSYCH%2F73164\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef72220 graphicRef60363 graphicRef73164 \">form 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

It occurs during a course of ECT and typically resolves within two weeks after completing the course. We thus suggest that patients refrain from driving during an acute course of ECT and for at least 24 hours after a single ECT (during continuation and maintenance ECT), or from making important business or personal decisions for one to two weeks after completing an acute course of ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Retrograde amnesia involves forgetting recent memories and is the most anxiety-producing cognitive effect of ECT. The memories are for events that occur during the course of ECT and a period of weeks to a few months prior to that.

Bilateral ECT causes more retrograde amnesia than right unilateral.

The purpose is to prevent relapse of the mood or psychotic episode that prompted the acute course of ECT. Maintenance ECT refers to ECT given beyond continuation ECT, to patients who have recovered from the acute mood or psychotic episode but require treatment to prevent recurrence of a new episode. Continuation and maintenance ECT are usually outpatient procedures.</p><p>Mood and psychotic disorders are chronically recurring illnesses. Therefore, continuation and maintenance treatment (with pharmacotherapy, ECT, psychotherapy, or a combination) are required for most patients who recover from an initial episode. As an example, in a prospective, observational study of 154 patients with major depression who remitted after successful treatment with ECT in community hospitals, 64 percent relapsed during 24 weeks of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>We suggest continuation and maintenance ECT for depressed patients who have successfully completed a course of acute ECT and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse without continuation and maintenance treatment (either pharmacotherapy or ECT), and require a second a course of acute ECT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fail one or more courses of continuation and maintenance pharmacotherapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prefer continuation and maintenance ECT</p><p/><p>The electrode placement used for continuation and maintenance ECT should be the same as that used for acute ECT.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Indications for and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pre-ECT evaluation should include a complete medical history emphasizing cardiopulmonary disease and prior surgeries. Appropriate physical examination and laboratory evaluation, guided by the relevant history, should be performed. Medical consultation prior to ECT is indicated for most patients 40 years or older, and is frequently obtained in younger patients as well. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pre-ECT evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inducing a seizure causes transient increases in blood pressure, pulse, and intracranial pressure, which can have deleterious effects. Organ systems of most concern are cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous system. Medication to blunt increases in heart rate and blood pressure is indicated prior to ECT and during the procedure in patients for whom these increases would be detrimental. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Patients with comorbid general medical illness'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-electroconvulsive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for electroconvulsive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many psychotropic medications may be continued during a course of ECT for their synergistic effect without compromising safety, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>. Morning doses on the day of ECT are given after the patient has recovered from that day's procedure. Anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines often interfere with ECT and may need to be tapered and discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Psychotropic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cardiac, antihypertensive, and anti-reflux medications should be taken with a small sip of water approximately two hours before each ECT treatment. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Other drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The psychiatrist should ensure that the consent process conforms to all state and local laws and statutes, and hospital policies. Informed consent requires that the patient receives adequate information about depression and ECT, is capable of understanding and acting reasonably on this information, and is given the opportunity to consent in the absence of coercion. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Informed consent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A typical course of ECT consists of 6 to 12 treatments, individualized for each patient. Treatment should usually continue until remission of mood or psychotic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Number of treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard practice in the United States is to give ECT three times per week. The routine in many other countries is twice a week. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment frequency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuation ECT is the practice of providing a single ECT treatment, at an interval of one to eight weeks, during the first six months after remission. Maintenance ECT refers to ECT given beyond continuation ECT. Continuation and maintenance ECT are usually provided on an outpatient basis to prevent relapse or recurrence of the mood or psychotic episode that prompted the acute course of ECT. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Continuation and maintenance ECT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality rate of ECT is at most 2 to 4 deaths per 100,000 treatments, making it one of the safest procedures performed under general anesthesia. Mortality is mostly related to cardiopulmonary events. Other adverse medical effects include aspiration pneumonia, fracture, dental and tongue injuries, headache, and nausea. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Adverse general medical effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients experience some adverse cognitive effects during and after a course of ECT, including acute confusion, anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia. However, objective tests indicate that neuropsychological impairment caused by ECT is generally short lived. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Adverse cognitive effects'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-for-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lisanby SH.
