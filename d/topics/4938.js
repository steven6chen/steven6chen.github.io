The prognosis for survival and long-term outcomes of these neonates continues to improve and can be attributed, in part, to widespread use of antenatal corticosteroids in women at risk for preterm birth, liberal use of cesarean delivery for fetal indications, improvements in neonatal resuscitation, use of surfactant therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> prophylaxis, and delivery at facilities with personnel experienced in neonatal intensive care.

Elective cesarean delivery is associated with known risks for the mother and no proven benefits for the LBW neonate in cephalic presentation, whether labor is spontaneous or induced.</p><p>The rationale for routine cesarean delivery of the LBW fetus when preterm delivery is necessary or inevitable is based upon the hypothesis that avoidance of active labor and vaginal delivery might improve survival by reducing hypoxic stress, asphyxia, and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, there is no strong evidence supporting this hypothesis and available evidence suggests that the route of delivery is not a significant independent factor affecting perinatal mortality or neurodevelopment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2013 Cochrane review of four randomized trials (n = 116 women) comparing cesarean versus attempted vaginal delivery for preterm singletons, there were no statistically significant differences in perinatal morbidity or mortality between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the small number of pregnancies precluded making any conclusions about the optimal route of delivery. The authors observed that one in six babies did not deliver by the method to which they were allocated, in part due to precipitous deliveries and to nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2013 systematic review of case-control and cohort studies that analyzed the association between cesarean delivery and cerebral palsy, cesarean delivery (elective or emergency) was not associated with a significant reduction in risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.47-1.40; six studies, n = 2416 deliveries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The gestational age range for the preterm deliveries varied widely among the included studies.</p><p/><p>In addition, most evidence from retrospective studies performed worldwide has not demonstrated significant improvement in perinatal morbidity or mortality for the vertex fetus delivered by cesarean, particularly when the primary indication for operative delivery was LBW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/7-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-21</a>]. Although a few studies have observed an increased risk of IVH or death among LBW newborns delivered vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], a consistent limitation of these studies is the marked differences in baseline characteristics between the cesarean and vaginal delivery groups. Obstetric complications that favor delivery by one method over the other are important confounders. Carefully accounting for maternal and fetal factors tends to eliminate route of delivery as a significant factor in risk of either mortality or IVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A longer-term study found that mode of delivery of periviable fetuses made no detectable difference in Bayley II scores at age two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=germinal-matrix-hemorrhage-and-intraventricular-hemorrhage-gmh-ivh-in-the-newborn-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H18679444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Delivery'</a>.)</p><p>The LBW newborn may be preterm or small for gestational age, although most studies have not distinguished between these two subgroups when evaluating outcome. There are limited observational data suggesting a survival advantage for some preterm growth-restricted fetuses delivered by cesarean compared with those delivered vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/12,14,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,26</a>]. This finding should be interpreted cautiously because of the limitations of observational data and because no studies have compared outcomes of prelabor cesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery. Some authors have hypothesized that labor has a deleterious effect on the preterm fetal brain and have suggested that cesarean delivery may only reduce neonatal morbidity if it is performed before the fetus is exposed to labor. However, elective cesarean delivery performed in an attempt to avoid exposing the fetus to the potentially deleterious effects of labor might lead to unnecessarily early delivery, since expectant management of many pregnancy complications can lead to significant prolongation of pregnancy with further fetal growth and maturation. Furthermore, preterm labor itself is the most common cause or contributing factor to delivery of LBW neonates and thus cannot be avoided in most cases.</p><p>An additional factor when considering the route of delivery is that cesarean delivery of LBW fetuses, especially those that are very low birth weight (VLBW) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW), is more likely to require a vertical or classical hysterotomy incision. This places the mother at increased risk of serious complications, such as placenta accreta and uterine rupture, in future pregnancies. Even a low transverse incision may be associated with an increased risk of future uterine rupture when compared with the same incision at term <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/228</span> [1.8 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">36/9558</span> [0.4 percent] in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]). </p><p>In addition, a classical hysterotomy commits her to cesarean delivery by 37 weeks of gestation for all future pregnancies, which increases the risk of neonatal morbidity compared with 39 weeks, the usual gestation age for scheduled repeat cesarean in women with a low transverse cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Postoperative issues&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Also of note, classical hysterotomy is associated with a high rate of serious postpartum complications in the index pregnancy. In one study, 23 percent of women who delivered preterm by a classical hysterotomy had serious postpartum complications (hemorrhage, infection, ICU admission, death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H210416547\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous vaginal versus assisted vaginal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compression of the fetal head increases cerebral venous pressure, which theoretically could promote IVH. There is no strong evidence that reducing maternal soft tissue compression of the fetal head during vaginal delivery is an important factor in preventing development of IVH in fetuses without a bleeding diathesis. For example, in a study that performed neonatal ultrasound on 288 neonates &le;2000 grams delivered from vertex presentation either spontaneously or by low forceps, no correlation between early periventricular or IVH and delivery method was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another study of 101 infants weighing 500 to 1500 grams reported that factors believed to affect head compression, such as use of episiotomy and forceps, did not correlate with the frequency of IVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAPARTUM ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1398691850\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatology consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal providers should have an opportunity to talk to and assess the patient before delivery, if possible.

This is particularly important for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and very preterm infants. In a 2010 meta-analysis of studies of the association between nursery level at birth and neonatal mortality, VLBW infants born in hospitals with level I or II nurseries had higher mortality than those born in hospitals with level III nurseries (38 versus 23 percent; OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.21-1.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. When analyzed by gestational age, infants &le;32 weeks of gestation born in hospitals with level I or II nurseries had higher mortality than those with level III nurseries (12 versus 7 percent; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06-1.88).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapartum fetal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring of the LBW fetus is indicated if a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern would prompt intervention. The immature fetal cardiovascular and nervous system of the preterm fetus results in fetal heart rate patterns that are normal for gestational age, but slightly different from the typical patterns seen later in gestation. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline fetal heart rate gradually decreases across gestation, but remains within the normal range (110 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute)</span>.

Although a large prospective epidemiologic study (EPIPAGE) reported an increased risk of neonatal mortality in very preterm infants undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia compared with general anesthesia or epidural anaesthesia, this study had several limitations (eg, confounding, nonstandardized anesthetic techniques) that preclude making a change in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The benefits and risks of various analgesic and anesthetic techniques are reviewed separately.

Selective use of episiotomy is reasonable when clinically indicated, such as deliveries with a high risk of severe perineal laceration or need to facilitate delivery of a possibly compromised fetus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-episiotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to episiotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vacuum-assisted delivery is contraindicated before 34 weeks of gestation because it may increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the preterm LBW fetus. Forceps should be used when an instrument-assisted delivery is necessary before 34 weeks of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H1152335739\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed above, the bulk of observational data suggest that the risk of IVH is not reduced by use of low forceps compared with no forceps (see <a href=\"#H210416547\" class=\"local\">'Spontaneous vaginal versus assisted vaginal'</a> above); therefore, prophylactic use of low forceps should be avoided. Use of low forceps when clinically indicated seems reasonable, since the risk of harm to the LBW fetus does not appear to be higher than in term fetuses whose weight is appropriate for gestational age. Two forceps are available which are smaller in dimension than standard forceps and are intended for use in a LBW or VLBW delivery. &quot;Baby&quot; Elliot and &quot;baby&quot; Simpson forceps are among these instruments. We were unable to identify any published studies or manufacturer guidelines regarding the estimated fetal weights or gestational ages at which these instruments might be most useful.

The uterus is less distended than with a term fetus and the lower uterine segment is less well-developed (thicker myometrium, smaller area). Thus, the hysterotomy incision is deeper and bloodier, and an adequate transverse incision to allow atraumatic extraction of the fetus may not be possible. It is also easy to inadvertently lacerate the fetus if the deepest layers if the myometrium are not incised carefully, especially in the setting of preterm premature ruptured membranes.</p><p>Since these fetuses are premature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> smaller, their bones and soft tissues are more delicate and prone to injury. To avoid iatrogenic injury, the pressure applied to grasp and extract them should be much less than that used for a normal term fetus.</p><p>Also, because of the markedly reduced fetal size, the uterus is significantly smaller and occupies less of the abdomen and pelvis than larger, term pregnancies. As a result, the mother's intestines, which are usually confined to the upper abdomen in a cesarean delivery, may descend into the operative field and may need to be manually displaced with either retractors or packing.</p><p>To address all of the issues during the cesarean delivery of the extremely premature or growth restricted fetus, obstetricians should carefully consider their choice and size of skin and uterine incisions. Although a low transverse skin incision (Pfannenstiel) is still a reasonable choice, surgeons should make sure that the skin incision length is adequate to provide the exposure requirements one might encounter; in particular, the skin incision should not be prorated smaller to adjust for the smaller size of the fetus.</p><p>While some deliveries can be accomplished safely via a low transverse uterine incision, the lack of development of the lower uterine segment often precludes this option. A vertical uterine incision may be a more prudent choice and guarantees adequate access to the fetus without the risks of head entrapment or injury to the uterine arteries. In one study, 50 percent of cesareans in singleton pregnancies &le;26 weeks of gestation were performed using a classical hysterotomy; the rate was lower in twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-the-preterm-low-birth-weight-singleton-fetus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The immature fetal cardiovascular and nervous system of the preterm fetus results in fetal heart rate patterns that are normal for gestational age, but slightly different from the typical patterns seen later in gestation.

Although a low transverse skin incision (Pfannenstiel) is a reasonable choice, the skin incision should not be prorated smaller to adjust for the smaller size of the fetus.
