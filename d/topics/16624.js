Physical pain, odor, chronic drainage, and disfigurement are common features of this disorder. </p><p>The surgical management of hidradenitis suppurativa is reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and medical management are discussed separately.

Surgery should not be used in isolation; combining surgery with dietary restrictions and medical therapy provides the best chance for preventing the development of new lesions and controlling disease progress. As surgery is an invasive procedure that will result in additional scarring, prior to proceeding, the risks, benefits, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient. </p><p>Surgical procedures may be performed on individual inflammatory nodules, abscesses, or sinus tracts and in severe cases may be necessary to excise an entire affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The approach to treating lesions is individualized and becomes more aggressive with higher-stage HS, particularly if medical therapies have not been successful at controlling the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H1357267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical techniques used to treat HS are listed and discussed in more detail below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Punch debridement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unroofing </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide excision </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incision and drainage</p><p/><p>Surgery aids in the control of inflammation through several mechanisms by removing epithelialized sinus tracts and associated debris that act as foreign bodies under the skin and removing and draining inflammatory material. Arresting these processes prevents the progressive invasion and sinus formation that lead to scarring.

The choice of an anti-inflammatory agent before surgery depends upon disease severity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H3023157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mild-to-moderate disease (ie, Hurley stage I or II), systemic anti-inflammatory antibiotics, with or without short courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, are used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severe disease (ie, Hurley stage III), systemic glucocorticoids (40 to 60 mg per day for two to three days followed by a 7- to 10-day taper) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally) have been used to settle inflammation.

For small lesions, many clinicians will continue oral suppressive antibiotics. For larger lesions, intravenous antibiotics that are culture directed can be useful for several days following surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H29058548\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Other antibiotics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H605053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764654822\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local surgical procedures (eg, punch debridement, unroofing) are used in conjunction with medical therapies for the management of acutely inflamed nodules and sinus tracts. Based upon observational studies and clinical experience, we suggest unroofing (local or extensive) initially, rather than wide excision for mild-to-moderate HS (ie, Hurley stage I or II). For small nodules, we use the technique of punch debridement (mini-unroofing). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1487130165\"><span class=\"h2\">Punch debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Punch debridement is our treatment of choice for acute inflammatory nodules, typically in patients with mild or moderate HS (ie, Hurley stage I or II). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H5758489\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Hurley stage II'</a>.)</p><p>Punch debridement is relatively simple and can be easily performed in the office or clinic setting. Punch debridement (mini-unroofing) is centered around a single folliculopilosebaceous unit (FPSU) to evacuate a newly inflamed nodule. The objective of punch debridement is to remove the fractured FPSU in the initial punch with its associated sebaceous glands (if still present) and, more importantly, to remove the &quot;bulge&quot; area of the follicular unit of the FPSU that contains the stem cells hypothesized as responsible for inducing growth of the proliferative mass and the subcutaneous sinuses and sinus tracts. The surgical removal of the entire involved FPSU in this manner eliminates the potential for lesion recurrence and prevents the development of the invasive proliferative gelatinous mass that results from follicular rupture and likely leads to sinus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H259634200\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mechanism'</a>.)</p><p>Punch debridement involves the use of a 5- to 7-mm circular punch instrument (identical to that used in a punch biopsy) to deeply excise the acutely inflamed FPSU within an inflammatory nodule with a small amount of surrounding tissue. This is followed by aggressive debridement using digital pressure and then curettage or simple grattage (scrubbing) with gauze wrapped around a cotton-tipped swab (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64990\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64990 \">picture 1</a>). Ferric chloride can be used for hemostasis, and simple petrolatum dressings are applied after the procedure. The wound is allowed to heal by secondary intention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pain relief and healing are swift. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H834813302\"><span class=\"h2\">Unroofing (local or extensive)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical unroofing (also described as deroofing) is indicated for the treatment of inflamed nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts typically found with moderate and severe HS (ie, Hurley stage II or III). </p><p>The procedure may be performed on individual nodules or sinuses (local unroofing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70778 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50847 \">picture 3</a>) or on all such lesions in an affected region (extensive unroofing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66627 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57893\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57893 \">picture 5</a>). The technique consists of careful unroofing and debridement of sinuses and inflamed tissue by a surgeon who has experience with this procedure. Under local or regional anesthesia, sinus tracts or the inflamed cavity are entered through the overlying skin or through a sinus opening and opened widely with scissors, explored with scissor tips or a malleable metal probe, and serially unroofed until no residual tracts of inflammatory activity remain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96166\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef96166 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The entire roof of each tract should be completely removed and both base and margins explored for hidden entrances to other sinuses. The active proliferative inflammatory mass that is attempting to repopulate the area with new FPSUs must be completely removed by rough gauze grattage (scrubbing) or by sharp curettage with a spoon curette, such as a 6 x 8 mm #0 oval or a Volkmann bone curette. Any residual epithelialized sinus floor may be left exposed to assist healing by secondary intention, or it may be dissected away [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Ferric chloride solution provides adequate hemostasis. Ferric chloride solution for hemostasis (3.8 <strong>molal</strong> 37.5% <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/volume</span> ferric chloride anhydrous in water, Delasco) is applied with a cotton swab, then wiped dry, and this is repeated until hemostasis is complete. An electrocoagulation or electrodesiccation device is very occasionally useful for hemostasis or for cutting where appropriate. </p><p>Carbon dioxide laser excision with healing by secondary intention can also be used to perform the unroofing of nodules, abscesses, or sinus tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In one study using this approach, healing took four to eight weeks and the scars were flat and linear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Only one recurrence was noted along the margin of the surgical scar in a previously treated area. In a retrospective review of 185 HS areas in 61 patients, carbon dioxide laser excision appeared effective for healing areas of HS, with recurrences detected in only two treated sites during follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532236330\"><span class=\"h2\">Role for I&amp;D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine incision and drainage (I&amp;D) of individual nodules is <strong>not</strong> an effective or appropriate method for managing HS. I&amp;D provides only short-term relief, and because I&amp;D does not clear the actively growing tissue, lesions treated in this manner tend to recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/1,2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10</a>]. Thus, we convert any situation that suggests the need for I&amp;D into an opportunity to perform a punch debridement (for small, acute inflammatory nodules) or an unroofing procedure (for larger areas of involvement). (See <a href=\"#H1487130165\" class=\"local\">'Punch debridement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H834813302\" class=\"local\">'Unroofing (local or extensive)'</a> above.)</p><p>In an early study of 31 patients of whom 6 underwent I&amp;D, the recurrence rate after a mean follow-up period of 72 months was 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a retrospective study of 590 patients with HS who were treated surgically at a single institution between 1976 and 2012, patients treated with I&amp;D had a higher recurrence risk than those treated with surgical excision (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technique of incision and drainage for skin abscess&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Nevertheless, I&amp;D may be needed for the immediate relief of pain in the setting of a tense subcutaneous abscess that is too painful to bear. When necessary, the lesion must be deeply incised. Wide local anesthesia is usually adequate. Packing the wound for a few days is usually needed to prevent premature superficial closure while the wound fills in from below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H456663840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound packing'</a>.)</p><p>The need for repeated I&amp;D should serve as an indicator that initiation of behavioral and dietary modification and medical therapies to control the disease should be undertaken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'General approaches'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258151148\"><span class=\"h1\">WIDE EXCISION AND RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide excision may be needed to manage an area of chronic or extensive HS (Hurley stage III) when more conservative medical and surgical measures fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Surgery, which entails wide excision of the entire affected area with surgical margins well beyond the clinical borders of disease, combined with continued aggressive medical management is the treatment most likely to achieve the best results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment#H5758497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Hurley stage III (severe and refractory disease)'</a>.)</p><p>Wide excision can often substantially change the course of disease. Although not technically curative, many patients will be asymptomatic for long periods of time following resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The results are often very satisfying for patients with severe disease that is not be adequately controlled with medical or less aggressive surgical therapy. Many patients prefer the more definitive nature of wide excision, particularly if they have been experiencing complications from medical therapies. There is a tradeoff between performing a larger excision (with higher surgical complications and longer times to heal) compared with a smaller excision (with higher risks of developing clinically significant disease adjacent to the excision). (See <a href=\"#H1645313720\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p>It is essential to note that wide excision need not be the destructive &quot;en bloc deep to the fascia&quot; technique used in managing extensive soft tissue infection or malignancy. Tissue should be removed until only soft, normal-appearing subcutaneous fat remains. Removing more than the epidermis, its appendages, sinuses, and associated inflammation and scar tissue is only necessary when a true fistula (to an underlying hollow organ) is encountered, which is rare. </p><p>The best method of skin closure after wide excision is controversial and largely dependent on the size of the excision. Some prefer healing by secondary intention for even very large excisions. Although effective, this submits patients to long periods of dressing changes that can be painful. Local excision with primary closure (eg, Pollock procedure) is quite useful for smaller excisions, but if the disease is not adequately excised, active disease can then present at the periphery of the excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one retrospective study of patients who underwent limited regional excision (resection of abscess and fistula-containing skin in the affected region [n = 14]) or radical wide excision (removal of all hair-bearing skin in the affected region with a clear margin of at least 1 cm [n = 11]), the recurrence rates after a mean follow-up period of 72 months were 43 and 27 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Also, with local excision and primary closure, wound dehiscence is a risk that increases as the excision size increases. The trauma of surgery and the tension of the sutures may activate new lesions along the incision and closure line. We prefer to use mostly subcuticular sutures and dissolvable sutures on the skin to avoid local reactivation of the disease and to avoid pain of suture removal. </p><p>With more extensive surgical excision, closure of the skin defect with advancement flaps or split-thickness skin grafting may be needed to accelerate wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The choice of a skin graft versus a flap depends on the size of the lesion; the characteristics of the adjacent skin; and the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A new concept has been introduced that involves &quot;recycled&quot; skin grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. This has been applied to large areas of hidradenitis. In these cases, the surgeon harvests the skin from the resected area, excising the deeper skin and subcutaneous tissue involved in the inflammatory process and then reapplying the skin as a graft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111061\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111061 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H969873361\"><span class=\"h2\">Axilla</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillary lesions are one of the most common areas where wide surgical excision is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The extent of the excision varies both in terms of area and depth. These excisions need to be approached with caution when approaching the area of the axillary vein since sinus tracts can traverse closely to the vein in the most severe cases. </p><p>Primary closure can often be effective for small excisions and for larger excisions in patients who have lost weight. For wounds with modest tension, the wound can be closed over a negative pressure wound healing device that is left in place for two to three days. The patient is then returned to the operating room for removal of the sponge and inspection of the wound. If clean, the remainder of the wound can be closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>For larger lesions, flaps and skin grafts are often used for closure. Flaps have the advantage of providing thicker skin coverage; however, the flap can often be too thick and may require debulking. </p><p>When skin grafts are used, they are often meshed to help with the contour of the wound and allow for drainage. Skin grafting is also quite effective but takes longer to heal compared with flaps. For very large areas, flaps are very often not an option, and skin grafts remain a nice option. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H770127169\"><span class=\"h2\">Inguinal/perineal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions commonly also occur in the groin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53340 \">picture 7</a>) and can also occur in the perineum, labia majora, and scrotum. Sinus tracts in this area can be extensive, and meticulous dissection is required to get a clear removal. In the scrotum, these can track around the spermatic cord. Judgment is needed to determine the extent of excision and type of closure. We follow similar guidelines for closure in the axilla (above). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453759119\"><span class=\"h2\">Gluteal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gluteal lesions can often be extensive and can either involve the skin or in some cases have extensive subcutaneous tunneling. Radical excision of the tunnels and diseased tissue is necessary to clear the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2519793044\"><span class=\"h2\">Perianal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perianal lesions are challenging as they are near the anus. Local flaps and skin grafts are often necessary to provide coverage in these areas. We generally defer surgical treatment in this region until other areas of the body have been treated. In some cases, lesions located here improve as systemic inflammation from other areas subsides. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3979851281\"><span class=\"h2\">Breasts and lower abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease on the underside of large breasts and beneath a pannus is frequently seen in obese patients. These lesions can be treated with good outcomes using breast reduction surgery or panniculectomy.

The petrolatum must cover all surfaces of the gauze to avoid adherence of dry gauze to the wound. Daily (or more frequent) dressing changes involve gentle rinsing of the wound in clear running water, free of soap or cleansers, followed by the reapplication of petrolatum. The gauze is best eliminated from the wound care regimen as soon as possible to avoid scrubbing off newly generated epithelium. The epithelializing margins of the wound must not be debrided or even touched. Loose clothing should be worn to avoid friction in the reepithelializing areas. </p><p>After the initial few days, a simple thick application of petrolatum to the wound edges is sufficient. Healing progresses inward from the wound edges and upward from the wound base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81667\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81667 \">picture 8</a>) and may be accelerated in large wounds with skin grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2482568590\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative pressure wound therapy is our preferred method for managing large open wounds and facilitating adherence of skin grafts or flaps.

Although many authors use the term &quot;recurrence,&quot; in our experience, the disease does not &quot;recur&quot; after wide excision but can develop in other areas, either around the previous excision or in other anatomic areas. If disease comes back adjacent to areas that are widely excised, we will generally refer the patient for medical management and try to space surgeries at least three months apart. If medical management is not successful, in most cases small excisions with direct closure can be used to treat any new disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3168273870\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Measures to prevent new HS lesions include dietary and behavioral changes and topical or systemic medications, including antibiotics. Surgical interventions may become necessary to manage nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scars. (See <a href=\"#H269906458\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery should not be used in isolation; combining surgery with dietary restrictions and medical therapy provides the best chance for preventing the development of new lesions and controlling disease progress. (See <a href=\"#H54978985\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical options for management of HS include punch debridement, unroofing of sinus tracts or abscesses, and wide excision. The choice of procedure depends on the severity of the lesion. The evidence supporting these interventions is limited to observational studies and clinical experience. Our approach is generally as follows (see <a href=\"#H54978985\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For acutely inflamed nodules or extensive sinuses, we suggest unroofing (local or extensive) combined with medical therapy, rather than wide excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For small nodules, we use the technique of punch debridement (ie, mini-unroofing). (See <a href=\"#H834813302\" class=\"local\">'Unroofing (local or extensive)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with chronic or extensive disease, we suggest wide excision of the entire affected area combined with continued aggressive medical management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Wide excision offers the best chance to provide permanent relief for patients with HS in a localized area that fails to respond sufficiently to medical therapies and that has progressed to a point where surgical unroofing has failed or is unlikely to be sufficient. Some patients with earlier stages of disease may request surgical excision if they become frustrated or have complications related to medical therapies. (See <a href=\"#H4258151148\" class=\"local\">'Wide excision and reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> performing incision and drainage (I&amp;D) alone for the management of HS except in the setting of a tense abscess when immediate relief of pain is required (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). I&amp;D alone is <strong>not</strong> an effective method for managing HS because lesions treated in this manner tend to recur. (See <a href=\"#H532236330\" class=\"local\">'Role for I&amp;D'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3820053139\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span></p><p>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Lynette Margesson, MD, FRCPC, FAAD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>We are saddened by the death of F.
