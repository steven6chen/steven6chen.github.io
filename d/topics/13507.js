In addition, there is no evidence that serum urate reduction to levels that remain above the limit of solubility carries with it clinical benefits equivalent to those achievable at sub-saturating levels. Thus, gout can be regarded as a &quot;threshold&quot; disease in which the long-term goals of therapy are to prevent the recurrence of gout flares and to reverse prior signs of the disease by achieving and maintaining sub-saturating serum urate concentrations.</p><p>Management for the prevention of recurrent gout flares and damage to joints and other tissues from urate crystal deposition includes drug therapy as well as lifestyle modification and other strategies for risk reduction. Long-term success in maintaining sub-saturating urate levels is attended by clinical benefits that include cessation of acute gout flares, resolution of tophi, and improvement in patient physical function and health-related quality of life. However, resolution of the urate crystal burden may require many months to several years to attain, even after sub-saturating urate levels are achieved either by lifestyle modifications (risk reduction) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with oral urate-lowering agents.

Pharmacologic urate-lowering measures are usually required in patients with tophaceous gout, although, in a few patients with complications due to tophaceous disease, surgical intervention may be an adjunct to medical management. Treatment may be more challenging in patients with compromised renal function and large tophaceous deposits.</p><p>Upon resolution of a gout flare, the patient is said to have entered an intercritical (between flares) period (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout#H56519131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;, section on 'Intercritical gout and recurrent gout flares'</a>); during this period, the following preventive issues should be addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of reversible causes of hyperuricemia to facilitate lifestyle modification and other changes that may be helpful in risk reduction, such as dietary changes, weight loss, reduction in alcohol intake, and substitutions for medications that may cause hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lifestyle modification and other strategies to reduce the risk of gout flares and progression of gout&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of comorbid diseases common in patients with gout, such as hypertension, chronic renal functional impairment, cardiovascular disease, and the components of the metabolic syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy, primarily to reduce the risk of gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below)</p><p/><p>During the intercritical period, classification of the patient with regard to the mechanism(s) underlying hyperuricemia and gout (including hyperuricemia due to either increased purine biosynthesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urate overproduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a>) or decreased uric acid clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>), may also be helpful in disease management.

The resulting large urate crystal burden may thus require many months to several years to resolve, even after sub-saturating soluble urate levels are achieved. Moreover, the inflammatory responses displayed in gout flares are most often induced by preformed urate crystal deposits rather than by newly deposited crystals. These features of the natural history of gout and gout therapy explain why clinically demonstrable success in urate-lowering gout therapy requires a substantial period of time and also why the initial months or years of treatment may be punctuated by seemingly paradoxical gout flares, with their accompanying disability, even when serum urate levels are within the sub-saturating range.</p><p>In the absence of evidence that serum urate reduction to levels that remain above the limit of solubility carries with it clinical benefits equivalent to those achievable at sub-saturating levels, the importance of regarding gout as a &quot;threshold&quot; disease is underscored, as is the specific therapeutic requirement for lowering and maintaining urate levels in the sub-saturating range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important elements of therapy for the prevention of recurrent gout flares include the identification of reversible factors, such as dietary characteristics or treatments for comorbid disorders, that can promote hyperuricemia and the risk of gout and may reduce the efficacy of urate-lowering drug therapy. Hyperuricemia and gout are often associated with one or more major disorders such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and ethanol abuse. These issues and strategies to address them, such as changes in diet and careful attention to the impact on hyperuricemia and gout of medications used for the management of hypertension, are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lifestyle-modification-and-other-strategies-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-flares-and-progression-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lifestyle modification and other strategies to reduce the risk of gout flares and progression of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG THERAPY: INDICATIONS, RATIONALE, AND GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments to prevent recurrent gout flares are strongly indicated in patients with multiple recurrent attacks annually or with clinical or imaging findings that indicate joint injury (gouty arthropathy) or the development of tophi, as well as in selected patients with renal disease, urolithiasis, or marked hyperuricosuria (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below). Preventing recurrent gout flares, progressive gouty arthritis, and tophi often requires the long-term use of drugs that reduce the serum urate concentration either by enhancing renal excretion of uric acid (uricosuric agents) or by decreasing urate synthesis (xanthine oxidase inhibitors [XOIs]) or both. The choice of specific drug therapy depends upon several factors. (See <a href=\"#H444919675\" class=\"local\">'Choice of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Timely introduction, monitoring, and adjustment of urate-lowering therapy to achieve and maintain sub-saturating urate levels are important factors in successful accomplishment of suppression and reversal of the signs and symptoms of gout (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> below). Once initiated, pharmacologic therapy should usually be continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initiation and duration of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>While prolonged use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may prevent recurrent gout flares (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below), they do not prevent the development of silent bony erosions and tophaceous deposits. Urate-lowering therapies, including the XOIs, can help to reduce tophaceous deposits that may be present (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Xanthine oxidase inhibitors'</a> below); in addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegloticase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegloticase</a>, a polyethylene-glycolated, modified mammalian recombinant uricase (urate oxidase), which converts urate to the more soluble purine end product allantoin, may be effective as a treatment for refractory tophaceous gout. (See <a href=\"#H444920239\" class=\"local\">'Uricase'</a> below.)</p><p>Robust data confirm the view that sustained lowering of serum urate to sub-saturating levels prevents recurrent gout flares. By contrast, an effect of urate-lowering drugs in preventing or slowing progression to functionally significant renal impairment in patients with gout has been postulated but has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. It remains uncertain as to whether hyperuricemia alone or hyperuricemia in patients with gout produces functionally significant renal disease.

Two flares or more annually is often quoted as an indication for urate-lowering treatment. However, a lower threshold for treatment may be considered after discussion with the patient if even infrequent flares are especially prolonged, interfere with vocational or avocational activities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> continue to recur over several years.</p><p>Urinary uric acid excretion of &gt;1100 mg (&gt;6.5 mmol) per day in patients with gout is associated with an almost 50 percent incidence of urolithiasis, which provides a relative indication for treatment. In clinical practice, accurate determination of daily urinary uric acid excretion is often difficult or impractical to obtain. Nevertheless, it is important to make this measurement in selected patients, such as when uricosuric drug therapy is considered and when gout occurs in young men (&lt;25 years old) or premenopausal women, which are patient groups that are enriched for familial forms of hyperuricemia.</p><p>Measurement of daily uric acid excretion may identify patients who have either an X chromosome-linked enzyme defect associated with uric acid overproduction and over-excretion (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate [PRPP] synthetase overactivity) or an underlying autosomal dominant renal disorder in which renal uric acid clearance is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The latter disorder is suggested by the presence of hyperuricemia with a normal or reduced 24-hour excretion of uric acid, especially when accompanied by a marked reduction in the fractional clearance of uric acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In practice, the most widely recommended goal range of urate-lowering therapy is serum urate &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;357 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which is substantially below the urate solubility limit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although this value was selected empirically, it has proved useful from an operational point of view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Lowering serum urate slowly (no more than 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [59 to 119 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> per month) is suggested in an effort to minimize the occurrence of gout flares, which occur more frequently in the early months of urate-lowering treatment and which may consequently decrease adherence to treatment. A goal serum urate of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;297 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> should be used in patients with tophi, as lower serum urate levels appear to speed resolution of tophi. Most expert groups have supported this treat-to-target approach. (See <a href=\"#H535769753\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of major groups'</a> below.)</p><p>A key to successful long-term gout management is monitoring of serum urate levels to assure maintenance of concentrations in the goal range and to permit urate-lowering drug dose adjustment as needed. One approach is to determine serum urate concentration within two to four weeks of a dose adjustment, with confirmation three months later. Once goal values are confirmed, measurement every six months for the next year and then annually is usually acceptable unless drugs or lifestyle factors potentially altering urate levels have been introduced in the interim.</p><p>The efficacy of lowering of serum urate to less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;357 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was illustrated by a retrospective study of Japanese patients with newly diagnosed gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients with average serum urate levels in this range over three years of <span class=\"nowrap\">observation/treatment,</span> 71 of 81 patients (86 percent) had no flare recurrences in the second and third years, a substantially lower proportion than in patients with higher average urate levels. Another retrospective review found that the optimal range of sub-saturating serum urate concentrations to avoid acute gout flares that occur in treated patients in the early months of urate-lowering therapy was 4.6 to 6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (273 to 392 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Lowering serum urate slowly (no more than 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [36 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> per month during the first six months) was associated with the lowest rate of early acute flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Population-based &quot;lower limits&quot; of normal for urate levels in adults reported by clinical laboratories are commonly in the range of about 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (180 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. No lower limit for serum urate concentration is widely accepted in the setting of urate-lowering efforts. Adverse neurologic or cardiovascular consequences of very low urate levels have been postulated based upon epidemiologic associations, but mechanistic and clinical evidence of such relationships have not been established. In fact, experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegloticase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegloticase</a> (pegylated recombinant modified mammalian uricase) (see <a href=\"#H444920239\" class=\"local\">'Uricase'</a> below), a biweekly, intravenously administered, urate-lowering biologic agent, has not identified adverse consequences in patients maintaining profound reductions of urate, often to unmeasurable levels, over many months to several years. Similarly, patients with hereditary xanthinuria, who have very low urate levels as a consequence of absent or nearly absent xanthine oxidase activity, are reported to have normal longevity and no increase in the incidence of neurologic or cardiovascular disease. Although there is considerable variation in individual responses to the available oral urate-lowering agents or combinations of agents, values less 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (120 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> are rarely encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation and duration of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has long been advocated that urate-lowering therapy should not be initiated until after an acute gout flare has resolved, and we support waiting at least two weeks after an acute flare has subsided to initiate urate-lowering medication (see <a href=\"#H444919675\" class=\"local\">'Choice of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below). This approach has been based upon the fact that acute urate-lowering can precipitate a gout flare and upon a concern that initiation of urate-lowering therapy during a gout flare may worsen or prolong the inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>The absolute risks of these complications of early urate-lowering therapy have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], and some experts have suggested that urate-lowering medication can occasionally be started together with antiinflammatory therapy during a gout flare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The latter approach is supported by a small trial in which 51 patients with gout flares were randomly allocated to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or placebo along with antiinflammatory gout flare medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The investigators found no differences between the groups in the mean pain scores (at any time between days 1 and 10), in the frequency of additional acute flares (two with allopurinol and three with placebo), or in the levels of acute phase reactants.</p><p>Potential advantages of waiting until at least two weeks after an acute flare subsides to initiate urate-lowering medication are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urate-lowering in gout is a long-term treatment for which there is no evidence that initiation during an acute flare promotes better outcomes or long-term adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum urate levels are in a normal range in 25 to 40 percent of patients with acute flares, and immediate addition of urate-lowering medication precludes obtaining an accurate baseline (pre-treatment) serum urate level, unless this has been established earlier in the patient's course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduction of urate-lowering therapy in the course of intensive antiinflammatory flare treatment has the potential to cloud the interpretation of which agent may be implicated in an adverse event accompanying antiinflammatory flare treatment, a problem of some significance given the rather narrow range of available urate-lowering agents of substantial efficacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that such early treatment hastens accomplishment of goal range serum urate levels (&lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> for which periodic titration of the selected agent to effect is recommended.</p><p/><p>Exceptions to delaying the introduction or upward titration of urate-lowering therapy until flare subsidence include: patients with documented gout who fulfill any of the above-noted indications for pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and have a recorded baseline serum urate level; and patients with very difficult-to-manage, almost perpetual flares, some of whom have had successful initiation of urate-lowering during flare in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or other antiinflammatory co-treatment followed by very slow tapering (over weeks to months) of the dose of the glucocorticoid or other agent. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the decision is made to begin therapy to lower serum urate, the duration of therapy is indefinite and should be continuous to remain effective. One study looked at the value of intermittent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> (two months per year) compared with continuous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Gout flares occurred with similar frequency in both groups during the first year, but after one year the continuous allopurinol treatment group experienced fewer flares.</p><p>The majority of patients who achieve control of gout with long-term urate-lowering therapy will have recurrent symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tophi if treatment is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In addition, lower serum urate concentrations during treatment correlate with a longer delay before flares resume or tophi reappear. In one study, for example, patients with average serum urate concentrations less than 5.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during continuous treatment for at least six years had the longest time to recurrence (mean of three to four years) after the cessation of urate-lowering therapy, probably due to a greater reduction in the total body urate pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In patients who adhere to lifestyle changes and risk reduction only after urate-lowering is initiated, or in the rare patient in whom the diagnosis of gout is unconfirmed by the demonstration of urate crystals and oral urate-lowering therapy achieves unusually low serum urate levels (for example, &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [180 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> with minimal daily doses of an oral, urate-lowering agent, withdrawal and observation may be done; in the first example, to assess the potential efficacy of nonpharmacologic management; and, in the second, to assess whether the diagnosis of gout was correct.</p><p>Nonadherence to recommended treatment is an important issue in patients with gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Treatment is prolonged (perhaps lifelong), and the patient is asymptomatic for the vast majority of the time. The extent of patient nonadherence was illustrated in a study that tracked use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> over two years in a managed care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Less than 20 percent of patients who initiated treatment complied well with therapy (defined as using the drug on 80 percent or more of the days during the study).

A number of factors can be determinants of which agent is chosen as first-line therapy at the site of care.</p><p>Foremost among the factors that determine which medication to choose are: the range of agents approved and thus available to the clinician to prescribe; the dose range recommended for each approved agent in the particular clinical circumstance; and the limitations on choice or dose of an agent set by comorbidities, which are frequent in gout patients. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> is the only potent uricosuric drug available in the United States as urate-lowering monotherapy, but it is neither as efficacious as benzbromarone, which is available in several other countries but not in the United States, nor as likely to achieve goal range serum urate levels in patients with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a> is approved for treatment of gout in the United States in doses of 40 or 80 mg; by contrast, European approval of febuxostat is for doses of 80 or 120 mg, the latter dose showing superior urate-lowering efficacy than the lower doses.</p><p>In patients with normal renal and hepatic function, we use low-dose prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> when initiating urate-lowering pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of gout flares during the early phases of urate lowering. A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is an alternative in patients who cannot tolerate colchicine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>We take the following approach to the selection of urate-lowering therapy, given the considerations noted above:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients in whom urate-lowering is indicated, we generally favor the use of the XOI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> as first-line urate-lowering therapy.

Although pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy can slowly reduce the size of tophi, some patients desire surgical excision for cosmetic reasons. Similarly, deformities due to joint damage may require arthroplasty. Such surgery may be safely performed in the absence of skin attenuation, ulceration, or soft tissue infection.</p><p>It is the author's opinion that, whenever possible, institution of urate-lowering therapy should precede surgery in order to increase the likelihood of prompt postoperative healing. Exceptions to this recommendation are nerve compression and active infection.</p><p>Tophaceous deposits may compress peripheral nerves, the cauda equina, or the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/130-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">130-132</a>]. In these instances, prompt surgical decompression is essential to prevent permanent neurologic impairment.</p><p>Tophi may erode through the skin producing chronic ulcers. With the loss of skin integrity, infection of the adjacent soft tissues, joint space, and bone is more likely. In one report of 45 patients with tophaceous gout who required surgery, the most frequent indications were infection (51 percent) and mechanical problems caused by foot, elbow, and hand tophi (27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Delayed wound healing was seen in 24 patients, 16 of whom had infected or ulcerated tophi prior to surgery.</p><p>Less often, surgical excision of a soft tissue mass leads to the initial diagnosis of tophaceous gout. In addition, permeative or erosive bone lesions have been mistaken for osteomyelitis and have led to excisions or amputations prior to establishing a diagnosis of gout. In some cases, it may be impossible to distinguish soft tissue or bone involvement due to gout from that due to infection using noninvasive studies; in this setting, needle aspiration or a surgeon's assistance in obtaining an excisional or needle biopsy may be invaluable. Biopsies should be examined for crystals fresh, frozen, or fixed in alcohol as formalin dissolves monosodium urate (MSU) crystals.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend prophylactic therapy during the initiation of urate-lowering drug treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We use low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (0.6 mg once or twice daily for patients with normal renal and hepatic function). A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is an alternative in patients who cannot tolerate colchicine; however, there is less available evidence to support its use. Prophylactic therapy should be continued for three to six months after sub-saturating serum urate values have been obtained in patients without tophi. The duration of prophylactic therapy is uncertain in patients with tophi. We continue colchicine until six months following resolution of the tophi or until it is clear that tophaceous deposits will not resolve despite persistent normouricemia. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis during initiation of urate-lowering therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery for gout is appropriate for patients with complications of tophaceous disease, including infection, nerve compression, joint deformity, and intractable pain. Some patients also desire surgery for cosmetic reasons. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Choi HK, Atkinson K, Karlson EW, et al.
