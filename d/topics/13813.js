The last cases of naturally occurring wild type paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States occurred during a small outbreak due to type 1 poliovirus in an unvaccinated religious community in 1978 to 1979 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All nations in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Region are now free of poliomyelitis. As of February 2017, wild type 1 poliovirus remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.</p><p>Issues related to paralytic poliomyelitis, the post-polio syndrome, and global eradication of poliomyelitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-polio-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-polio syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-poliomyelitis-eradication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global poliomyelitis eradication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">POLIOVIRUS VACCINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (IPV) and live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) were developed in the 1950s and have since been used worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPV is the only vaccine available for routine infant and childhood immunization in the United States and is the preferred vaccine in most middle- and upper-income countries because it does not cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of type 1 and 3 bivalent OPV (bOPV) vaccine and IPV is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) for routine infant immunization in low-income countries; both OPV and IPV continue to be administered through supplementary immunization activities in countries at increased risk of poliovirus transmission. Advantages of OPV include low cost, ease of administration, induction of mucosal immunity, and transmission of vaccine virus to unimmunized contacts; the major disadvantage is that OPV can cause VAPP in rare cases (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below). In this context, IPV provides protection against disease caused by type 2 polioviruses and a boost in immunity to types 1 and 3.</p><p/><p>Worldwide polio immunization practice has begun a phased transition from OPV to IPV in anticipation of global polio eradication before 2018, beginning with cessation of type 2 OPV use in April 2016 and the recent addition of one or more IPV doses to the EPI schedule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-poliomyelitis-eradication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global poliomyelitis eradication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6529745\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of the WHO'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Inactivated poliovirus vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPV is prepared by inactivation of wild type or Sabin (OPV) strain polioviruses by treatment with dilute formalin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. IPV is combined with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTPa), hepatitis B vaccine, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B vaccine for intramuscular administration in most upper- and middle-income countries, as well as in standalone formulations for countries that have continued whole cell pertussis (DTPw) vaccination. Thimerosal used in the production of DTPw reduces the potency of IPV, creating a challenge for manufacturers of these vaccine combinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune response and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPV seroconversion rates and antibody titers depend on the number of doses, the interval between doses, age at the first dose, and maternal antibody levels. In general, three doses administered at 2, 4, and 6 to 18 months of age are expected to induce seroconversion in &gt;95 percent of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The 6-, 10-, and 14-week schedule followed in many low- and middle-income countries in order to maximize immunization coverage results in lower but acceptable seroconversion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Detectable antibody persists at protective levels for at least five years, although geometric mean titers decline. In some cases, the level of antibody may fall below detectable levels over time, but persons who have previously seroconverted are likely protected by immune memory.</p><p>Fractional doses have been studied to mitigate the high cost of IPV for low-income countries and to expand supplies in response to a current IPV shortage. Dose per dose, fractional doses equal to 0.2 times a full dose delivered by intradermal injection result in lower seroconversion rates than full doses but effectively boost preexisting antibody titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The influence of primary IPV immunization on mucosal immunity is quite limited compared with OPV. However, IPV boosts both humoral and intestinal immunity in children who have previously received OPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In an open-label trial in India, 450 children one to four years of age who had previously received OPV were randomly assigned to receive IPV or no vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Seven days after a bOPV challenge dose, children in the IPV group were significantly less likely to shed poliovirus than the children in the no vaccine group, but the absolute differences were small (12 versus 19 percent for serotype 1 poliovirus, risk ratio [RR] 0.62, 95 CI 0.40-0.97; 8 versus 26 percent for serotype 3 poliovirus, RR 0.30, 95 percent CI 0.18-0.49).</p><p>There have been few opportunities to assess the efficacy of current IPV vaccine formulations under conditions of natural exposure to wild type or circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). A case-control study conducted following a type 1 poliomyelitis outbreak in Senegal in 1986 to 1987 found that one and two IPV doses administered to children in 1980 provided 36 percent (CI 0 to 67 percent) and 89 percent (CI 62 to 97 percent) efficacy, respectively, against paralytic disease, albeit with wide confidence intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These efficacy estimates track observed seroconversion rates for one and two IPV doses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similarly, a study in Tamil Nadu, India, found that three IPV doses had an efficacy of 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient local reactions (erythema, pain, induration) are comparable with reactions following a placebo injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With the exception of a single incident in which inadequately inactivated IPV from one manufacturer caused a serious outbreak of poliomyelitis shortly after initial licensure in the 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], there are no proven serious adverse events associated with IPV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPVs were developed by repeated passage of wild type polioviruses in primates and in cell culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>OPV remains an important tool for control of poliovirus transmission in the developing world because of low cost, ease of administration, induction of mucosal immunity, and transmission of OPV viruses from OPV-vaccinated children to their nonimmune contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A trivalent OPV formulation (tOPV) containing Sabin 1, 2, and 3 vaccine viruses was used worldwide until April 2016 when it was replaced with bivalent type 1 and type 3 OPV during a global synchronized switch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Withdrawal of type 2 OPV was required because type 2 wild polioviruses no longer circulate, and continued use of Sabin 2 viruses has been responsible for a disproportionate number of VAPP and cVDVP cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Assuming success of the global polio eradication program, all OPV vaccination will cease by 2021 in order to prevent ongoing generation of VDPV viruses.</p><p>OPV vaccines are no longer licensed in the United States.</p><p>An optimal immune response to OPV requires multiple doses. In developed countries, three tOPV doses given at least two months apart induced &ge;96 percent seroconversion to all three types after the third dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and detectable serum antibody to all three types persists in 84 to 98 percent of vaccinees five years after primary immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in some low-income countries, a series of tOPV doses at birth and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age induced lower seroconversion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>], averaging 73, 90, and 70 percent for types 1, 2, and 3, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Diarrheal disease at the time of immunization is a major factor. One study conducted in Brazil and Gambia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26</a>] and another one conducted in Bangladesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] showed that diarrhea reduced seroconversion rates to types 2 and 3 OPV, while the response to type 1 was not affected. The impact of diarrhea on seroconversion persists despite the administration of three or four trivalent OPV doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Bivalent type 1 and type 3 OPV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bivalent type 1 and type 3 OPV vaccine is now the only OPV routinely used worldwide. The absence of interference from type 2 poliovirus in the trivalent formulation leads to superior bOPV immunogenicity for types 1 and 3 compared with tOPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Trials in Latin America and Bangladesh have demonstrated seroconversion rates of &gt;94 percent to both type 1 and type 3 OPV among infants vaccinated with three bivalent OPV doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of trivalent OPV was never tested under conditions of exposure to natural polioviruses in the United States; however, nearly four decades of use from 1961 to 2000 provided overwhelming evidence of OPV effectiveness. OPV efficacy was directly evaluated during a type 1 poliovirus outbreak in Taiwan in the early 1980s when vaccine efficacy was estimated to be 82, 96, and 98 percent for one, two, and three or more doses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OPV viruses are shed from the oropharynx for up to 7 to 14 days after administration and in the stool for as long as 6 to 8 weeks in normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Stool shedding is associated with rapid loss of attenuating mutations in each of the three serotypes and an increase in phenotypic neurovirulence markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>VAPP is a rare but important consequence of reversion to neurovirulence, which was reported in an average of nine persons per year in the United States between 1961 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] and is estimated to occur in 3.8 persons per million births or 399 cases (range 306 to 490) in current OPV-using countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. VAPP occurs in OPV recipients (mostly infants) and among direct contacts of OPV recipients (mostly adult caretakers with inadequate immunity). The overall risk is about 1 case per 900,000 first-dose OPV recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Subsequent doses are less likely to be associated with VAPP in the United States but carry a higher risk in resource-poor countries, where OPV viruses may be less likely to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract following the first OPV dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Individuals with B cell immunodeficiency carry the highest risk, with an estimated VAPP rate of 2 per 1000 vaccinees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. For this reason, OPV is contraindicated for immunodeficient individuals.</p><p>In settings with inadequate vaccine coverage, OPV viruses can spread into the community as cVDPV that accumulate neurovirulent traits similar to wild type polioviruses through loss of the attenuating mutations associated with OPV. The emergence of cVDPV has influenced plans for the eventual cessation of poliovirus immunization following eradication of poliomyelitis, which will include a strategy to discontinue OPV use, introduce IPV for risk mitigation, develop monovalent OPV vaccine stockpiles to deploy in the event of unanticipated polio outbreaks, and plan for containment of laboratory stocks of naturally occurring and attenuated polioviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-poliomyelitis-eradication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global poliomyelitis eradication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other than vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, there are no adverse reactions attributed to OPV. The available data suggest that OPV does not increase the risk of fetal malformation or other adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poliovirus-vaccination/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>OPV is contraindicated for immunodeficient individuals.

The minimum interval between doses 1 and 2 and between doses 2 and 3 is four weeks, and the minimum interval between doses 3 and 4 is six months. The minimum age for dose 1 is six weeks. Minimum age and intervals should be applied when there is imminent threat of exposure, such as travel to an area in which polio is endemic or epidemic.

The polio vaccination series in the United States consists of four doses of IPV administered at 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years of age. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the addition of one or more IPV doses beginning at 14 weeks of age to supplement bivalent oral poliovirus vaccination.

Advantages to the use of OPV include cost, ease of administration, and transmission of vaccine virus to unimmunized contacts. The WHO recommends a bivalent OPV dose at birth, followed by a primary series of three OPV doses (at 6, 10, and 14 weeks) as well as at least one IPV dose (at &ge;14 weeks of age). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VAPP occurs as a result of reversion of an attenuated viral strain to a neurovirulent strain.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) are Sabin (OPV) virus derivatives that circulate in settings of low population immunity (eg, with low immunization rates) and revert to neurovirulence with ongoing transmission. The emergence of VDPV requires that use of all OPV vaccines must cease in order to achieve the goal of global poliomyelitis eradication.
