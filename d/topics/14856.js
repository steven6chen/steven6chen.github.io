Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for patients with VTE. Most patients with VTE are anticoagulated for a finite period (3 to 12 months) following a first episode of VTE. Select patients at increased risk of recurrent thrombosis beyond the conventional period may benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. Anticoagulation is administered in this setting to reduce the lifetime risk of recurrent thrombosis and VTE-associated death.</p><p>This topic will discuss therapeutic indefinite anticoagulation as opposed to prophylactic anticoagulation following an episode of VTE. Populations that are likely or unlikely to benefit from indefinite anticoagulation will be discussed along with the factors that contribute to making this decision. The indications for the initial and long term treatment of lower extremity DVT, as well as alternate therapies for patients with DVT and PE are discussed in detail separately.

In contrast, a provoked DVT is one that is usually caused by a known event (eg, surgery, hospital admission). VTE events can be provoked by transient major risk factors (ie, major surgery &gt;30 minutes, hospitalization or immobility &ge;3 days, cesarian section), transient minor risk factors (minor surgery &lt;30 minutes, hospitalization &lt;3 days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility &ge;3 days) or persistent risk factors. Persistent risk factors include reversible conditions (eg, curable malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease that resolves) and irreversible conditions such as inheritable thrombophilias, chronic heart failure, and metastatic end-stage malignancy.

Isolated distal DVT has no proximal component, is located below the knee, and is confined to the calf veins (peroneal, posterior, anterior tibial, and muscular veins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77469 \">table 1</a>). Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be located in the main, segmental, or subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial anticoagulation is administered in the first few days (up to 10 days) following a diagnosis of VTE. Long-term anticoagulant therapy is typically administered for a finite time beyond the initial period, usually three to six months, and occasionally up to 12 months (ie, scheduled stop date). Extended anticoagulation refers to therapy that is administered indefinitely (ie, no scheduled stop date).

The rationale for extending anticoagulation <strong>indefinitely</strong> is based upon long-term epidemiologic studies of recurrence risk after cessation of a conventional course of anticoagulation as well as randomized trials and meta-analyses that suggest that anticoagulation for prolonged periods successfully reduces the rate of VTE recurrence. Most studies are inadequately powered to assess mortality. Cumulatively, data suggest that the decrease in VTE recurrence seen with prolonged periods of anticoagulation is achieved at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding. Thus, indefinite anticoagulation is most likely to benefit those with an increased risk of recurrence in whom the risk of bleeding is low. Our approach to selecting those likely to gain benefit while minimizing harm is discussed in the sections below. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H648566\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS LIKELY TO BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and others agree that indefinite anticoagulation is likely to benefit the populations listed below, provided the risk of bleeding is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F97117\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97117 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

For those with a low to moderate bleeding risk, we suggest indefinite treatment rather than treatment for three to six months. For patients with a high bleeding risk, the benefits of indefinite anticoagulation are likely outweighed by the high risk of bleeding such that indefinite anticoagulation is not generally performed. (See <a href=\"#H380271939\" class=\"local\">'Making the decision to indefinitely anticoagulate'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650446999\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrence with and without anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for indefinite anticoagulation in patients with an unprovoked proximal DVT or symptomatic PE is based upon the high estimated lifetime risk of recurrent VTE, which can be dramatically reduced by extending anticoagulation beyond the conventional three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. Importantly, most studies report a risk reduction in the rate of VTE recurrence at the expense of an increased rate of bleeding and without mortality benefit. </p><p>The estimated risk of recurrence following cessation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked episode of VTE is 10 percent at one year and 30 percent at five years (approximately 5 percent per year after the first year) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107542 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3,4,7,8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,8,15,16</a>]. Prior duration of therapy does not affect the risk of recurrence once anticoagulant therapy is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. Full anticoagulation is associated with an over 90 percent reduction in the rate of recurrence compared with low-intensity anticoagulant regimens and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> which are less effective (approximately 60 and 30 percent rate reduction in recurrence respectively). This decrease in recurrence outweighs the rate of bleeding with full anticoagulation in most patients who are estimated to have a low (0.8 percent per year) or intermediate (1.6 percent per year) bleeding risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H380273132\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the risk of bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>The recurrence risk following a first episode of unprovoked VTE is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One systematic review of 11 studies in patients with acute VTE treated for at least three months reported recurrence rates of 7.4 percent per patient-year at 24 months after anticoagulation withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similar results were reported in a multicenter study with a recurrence rate of 12 percent at 26 months in a similar population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The risk was independent of the effect of age, prior duration of anticoagulation, and the presence or absence of symptoms or inherited thrombophilias. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial involving 267 patients with a first idiopathic DVT, recurrent VTE was significantly greater in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for three months compared with those receiving treatment for 12 months (8.3 versus 0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, rates of major bleeding were higher (4 versus 0.5 percent) and once anticoagulation was discontinued, the benefit was not maintained. Although mortality was not different between the groups, the study was not powered to detect such a difference. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The highest rates of recurrence occur in those with unprovoked proximal DVT and PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/8,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11,12</a>].

However, the analysis was fundamentally flawed in that it included studies that were low quality and included several different agents. </p><p>Summarized in the sections below are the major trials that demonstrated benefit from prolonged periods of anticoagulation with the oral anticoagulants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors, and from antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. Most trials pre-selected patients with unprovoked VTE and excluded patients at high risk for bleeding. Treatment periods were up to four years but on average one to three years with many trials that were stopped early for efficacy.

However, the risk varies considerably according to whether the cancer is active, progressive, metastatic, being treated, or cured. In addition, rates of bleeding are higher in patients with active cancer. Thus, the decision to extend therapy indefinitely in this population should carefully weigh the benefit of preventing VTE recurrence against the risk of bleeding, while also taking into consideration, the type of cancer, burden of disease, treatment received, patient preference, and life expectancy. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

These populations include those with recurrent provoked VTE, provoked VTE with persistent risk factors, unprovoked isolated distal DVT, and unprovoked incidental PE. For these patients, therapy should be <strong>individualized</strong> after carefully weighing patient-specific bleeding and thrombotic risk in the context of patient preferences and values. For example, in a patient with isolated distal DVT, indefinite anticoagulation may be considered in the presence of additional, irreversible, multiple risk factors (eg strong family history of DVT, active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome) or minor transient risk factors (eg, travel). In contrast, a patient with an isolated small subsegmental, incidental PE may prefer to avoid the adverse effects of indefinite anticoagulation that is without proven benefit.

In addition, a prior history of VTE was an independent predictor of recurrence (relative risk [RR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.16-2.52).

Patients in whom the D-dimer was normal at the third month but became abnormal thereafter had an intermediate risk of recurrent VTE (11.1 events per 100 patient-years).</p><p>The DULCIS study assessed the ability of D-dimer levels and imaging for residual vein thrombosis to predict patients with a low risk of recurrence following a first episode of VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/71,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,73</a>]. Patients with VTE who had persistently negative D-dimer levels by three months together with no or stable residual vein thrombosis had a low recurrence rate of three events per 100 patient-years over a two-year period. Among those who had elevated D-dimer levels at three months, anticoagulation reduced the rate of recurrence from 9 to 0.7 events per 100 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

In a prospective study, VTE recurrence rate was measured in 319 patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE who had two consecutive negative D-dimer levels; the first following completion of a standard course of anticoagulant therapy and the second at one month off anticoagulant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Another meta-analysis of 11 studies that included 3965 patients reported a major bleeding rate of 0.45 per 100 patient-years (95 % CI 0.29-0.64) and a fatal bleeding rate of 0.14 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0.057-0.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p>Using a bleeding risk model containing a comprehensive list of 17 risk factors, the rate of major bleeding was estimated, by the American College of Chest Physicians as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107543 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk (no risk factors present) &ndash; 1.6 percent during the first three months; 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span> thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate risk (one risk factor present) &ndash; 3.2 percent during the first three months; 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span> thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk (two or more risk factors) &ndash; 12.8 percent during the first three months; &ge;6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span> thereafter</p><p/><p>Risk factors associated with bleeding during anticoagulant therapy include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F97160\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97160 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,90</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age (&gt;65 years; assessed as two risk factors if &gt;75 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior bleeding (especially if not correctable)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer (assessed as two risk factors if metastatic or highly vascular)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal insufficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior stroke (especially if hemorrhagic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant antiplatelet or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent falls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced functional capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor control of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy </p><p/><p>The risk of bleeding is proportionate to the number of risk factors present.

Individual patients attach a variable degree of value on issues such as clinical and laboratory monitoring of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (eg, medication adjustments, telephone calls, frequency of office visits), inconvenience of or pain associated with injections (for low molecular weight heparin), and availability of reversal agents (for factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors) if bleeding were to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. In addition, patients weigh benefits and harms differently depending on their occupation, hobbies, comorbidities, and life expectancy. For example, a young patient who is a mountain climber may prefer to stop anticoagulation after an unprovoked event rather than increase their risk of bleeding from accidental falls. In contrast, an older patient with active cancer may choose to remain on anticoagulation and accept the higher risk of bleeding. The impact of patient values was illustrated in an observational study that reported that 10 percent of patients declined indefinite anticoagulation despite being candidates for it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380273809\"><span class=\"h2\">Agent selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, provided the selected long-term agent has been effective, patients who choose indefinite anticoagulation can continue their current anticoagulant rather than switch to a new agent. The rationale for this approach is that the relative efficacy and safety is expected to be similar during both phases of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rationale-and-indications-for-indefinite-anticoagulation-in-patients-with-venous-thromboembolism/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].
