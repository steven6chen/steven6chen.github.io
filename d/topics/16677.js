Increasing amounts of data support the view that early diagnosis of recurrent disease results in a more favorable outcome.</p><p>Intensive postoperative surveillance programs have been justified in the hope that early detection of asymptomatic recurrences will increase the proportion of patients who are potentially eligible for curative therapy. Although individual randomized trials do not demonstrate a survival benefit, meta-analyses suggest a modest but significant survival benefit from intensive surveillance after resection of CRC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Does early detection of recurrent disease improve survival?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important clinical question that arises when considering the debate over appropriate surveillance after treatment of primary CRC is whether early detection of recurrent disease improves survival. Reresection can cure some patients who have a limited localized recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-locally-recurrent-rectal-adenocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Management of locally recurrent disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer#H125360754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Locoregional recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>Surgery has curative potential for some patients with limited sites of metastatic disease, particularly involving the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Five-year survival rates approaching 40 percent have been reported in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for limited hepatic metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74509 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although isolated lung metastases are less common than liver involvement, metastasectomy has also been used to treat carefully-selected patients with lung metastases, with five-year survival rates of 35 to 45 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-benefits-indications-preoperative-evaluation-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies show that patients with asymptomatic rather than symptomatic recurrences are more likely to be eligible for potentially curative resection, they are more likely to have completely resected disease at reexploration, and they have significantly better progression-free and overall survival rates after such surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. This was shown in a meta-analysis that included 4055 patients with resected stage I, II, or III CRC who were enrolled in 11 trials comparing intensive follow-up (history and physical examination with serum, radiologic, and endoscopic tests; the intensive group) with <span class=\"nowrap\">minimal/no</span> follow-up (the control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Intense follow-up was associated with a significantly higher probability of detecting asymptomatic disease recurrence (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.66-4.06), of curative intent surgery at recurrence (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.51-2.60), and of all-cause (but not disease specific) survival after tumor relapse (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.24-3.69). Issues surrounding posttreatment surveillance for patients with resected stage I disease are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H595846\" class=\"local\">'Stage I disease'</a> below.)</p><p>However, it must be emphasized that symptomatic recurrences are not necessarily beyond the potential for curative treatment. In a review of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group's experience with recurrent colon cancer, 25 percent of ultimately resectable recurrences were symptomatic at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensive versus less intense surveillance strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend intensive postoperative surveillance for patients with resected stage II or III CRC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) who would be considered candidates for curative intent surgery. This recommendation is consistent with published guidelines from most expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2493\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>While the benefit of a more intensive versus less intensive posttreatment surveillance strategy continues to be debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], 6 of 12 randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/12-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-23</a>] and five separate meta-analyses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77401 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/9,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,24-27</a>] support a modest but significant overall survival benefit for intensive posttreatment surveillance following potentially curative resection of CRC. The best follow-up strategy is not established, in part because of the wide variation in follow-up programs in the randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, many studies included patients with stage I disease whose outcome is extremely favorable, further limiting the ability to detect a difference in outcome between the more and less intensively followed groups. </p><p>The contributions of serial CEA assay and periodic CT scanning were addressed in a trial conducted in the United Kingdom in which 1202 patients with stages I, II, or III resected CRC were randomly assigned to posttreatment follow-up with CEA &quot;alone&quot; (every three months for the first two years then every six months for three years, combined with a single CT scan at 18 months), CT alone (every six months for two years, then annually for three years), both tests, or minimal followup (follow-up testing only for symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. With a mean follow-up period of 4.4 years, two-thirds of recurrences were detected by a scheduled follow-up investigation. Of the 71 patients with a recurrence that was surgically treated with curative intent (5.9 percent of the total), rates were three to four times higher in each of the three more intensive surveillance groups (6.7, 8.0, and 6.6 percent, respectively for CEA &quot;alone,&quot; CT alone, and a combined approach), compared with only 2.3 percent in the minimum follow-up group. There was no evidence for an additive effect of combined CEA assay and CT scanning, although patients in the CEA &quot;only&quot; arm also received a single CT scan at 18 months. Despite the higher rates of potentially curative surgery for recurrent disease, the number of deaths was not significantly different in the intense monitoring group versus the minimal follow-up group (18.2 versus 15.9 percent, respectively, difference 2.3 percent, 95% CI -2.6 to 7.1 percent).</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of intensive surveillance was addressed in 2004 analysis in which the adjusted cost per year of life saved for intensive surveillance was US $5884 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Interventions that yield a cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $50,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained have been considered to have an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio in the United States and several other countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-short-primer-on-cost-effectiveness-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A short primer on cost-effectiveness analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of individual tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appropriate surveillance strategy should consider the temporal pattern and location of recurrent disease. The overwhelming majority of tumor recurrences develop within the first five years, most within the first two to three years after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>In general, liver metastases predominate overall, while lung metastases occur more commonly in patients with distal rectal cancers since the venous and lymphatic drainage of the distal rectum bypass the liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients have a clinical encounter with a physician every three to six months for the first three years, and every six months during years 4 and 5. Most recurrences develop within the first three years, although failure beyond three years is not uncommon, particularly in patients treated for locally advanced rectal cancer. A history should be obtained at each visit, aimed at highlighting symptoms that could suggest cancer recurrence. The physical examination should include a rectal examination for those patients who have undergone low anterior resection or a transanal excision for rectal cancer.

Although the available data are limited, routine periodic H&amp;Ps do not appear to influence the detection of resectable recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/10,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35</a>]. One reason may be that a significant number of recurrences are heralded by symptoms that occur between physician visits and are thus not affected by the performance of the H&amp;P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Additionally, liver and lung metastases are unlikely to be symptomatic early in their natural history.</p><p>The lack of contribution of routine physical examination to the outcome of surveillance was shown in a series of 1356 patients with stage II or III colon cancer who were followed according to a prescribed set of protocol guidelines after treatment on the multicenter adjuvant chemotherapy protocol Intergroup 0089 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the 421 patients who developed recurrent disease, 96 underwent surgical resection with curative intent. In this group, the first indication of recurrent disease was elevated CEA, symptoms, chest radiograph (CXR), or colonoscopy in 31, 25, 12.5, and 15 percent, respectively. Routine physical examination failed to identify a single resectable recurrence.</p><p>A history should be obtained at each visit, aimed at highlighting symptoms that could suggest cancer recurrence.

Because it lacks both sensitivity and specificity, serum CEA is not a useful screening tool for CRC. However, in patients with established disease, the absolute level of the serum CEA correlates with disease burden and is of prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Furthermore, elevated preoperative levels of CEA should return to baseline after complete resection; residual disease should be suspected if they do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The role of CEA testing as a component of posttreatment surveillance in patients with resected primary CRC has been extensively evaluated. The estimated sensitivity of CEA to detect disease relapse in patients with completely resected CRC depends on the threshold value used. In a Cochrane review, the pooled sensitivity for a cutoff value of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> was 82 percent, but specificity was only 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Sensitivity was lower for a threshold of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> (68 percent), but specificity was higher (97 percent), reflecting fewer false positives. For a cutoff of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> sensitivity and specificity rates were 71 and 88 percent, respectively. Serial measurement of CEA can detect disease recurrence even among patients with an initially normal CEA level, although the sensitivity is lower (between 27 and 50 percent in four separate studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]). Thus, a postoperative CEA elevation indicates recurrence with high probability, but a normal postoperative CEA level (even if it was initially elevated) is not useful for excluding a disease recurrence.</p><p>Despite its widespread use in follow-up strategies, the utility of serial CEA testing has been questioned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23113171\"><span class=\"h5\">Arguments in favor of CEA testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strongest argument put forth by advocates of serial CEA testing is that resection of limited metastases, particularly involving the liver, leads to long-term relapse-free survival in as many as 40 percent of patients who undergo an attempted resection. As noted previously, the detection of asymptomatic recurrences, particularly by CEA testing, increases the likelihood of a complete resection, which in turn is associated with better long-term outcome.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated a lead time of 1.5 to 6 months between elevation of serum CEA levels and detection of recurrent disease by other means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. Whether this lead time actually improves overall survival remains a point of controversy. However, as noted previously, at least one meta-analysis supports a significantly increased survival among patients who undergo intensive as compared with routine surveillance, as long as CEA testing is a component of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intensive versus less intense surveillance strategies'</a> above.)</p><p>Finally, although systemic chemotherapy for metastatic CRC has not significantly improved five-year survival rates, it has produced meaningful improvements in median and progression-free survival.

The influence of CEA monitoring on quality adjusted life expectancy varied from an average increase of seven days (+0.3 percent) to an average decrease of five days (-0.09 percent). Cost-effectiveness of CEA testing ranged from $22,963 to $4,888,208 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved.</p><p/><p>These results contrast with a simple cost analysis from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group database, in which the cost per resectable recurrence was only $5696 based upon 1995 Medicare reimbursement guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. CEA measurement was the most cost-effective test for detecting potentially curable recurrent disease. The contrast with the quality of life study exemplifies the tremendous difference between the cost per quality of life gained by treating a recurrence and the cost for simply finding the recurrence.

Although one of these assays (the DR-70 [FDP] enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] test [Onko-Sure]) is approved in the United States in conjunction with other clinical modalities for serial monitoring after treatment of CRC and in other countries (Europe, India, Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam) as a blood test for cancer detection, it is not clear that detection accuracy is improved over CEA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. In one study of 112 individuals with previously treated CRC, rates of sensitivity and specificity for the DR-70 assay in detecting clinical disease progression were 65 and 67 percent, respectively, and not better than CEA alone (sensitivity and specificity 65 and 73 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

One of the advantages of the DR-70 assay, which measures fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (collectively referred to as FDP) in the serum, is that the antigen is freely diffusible in the blood compared with CEA, which is normally attached to cancer cells due to its role as an adhesion molecule. </p><p>However, as with CEA, an elevated DR-70 assay value should not be interpreted as absolute evidence for the presence of disease recurrence, since a small percentage of healthy individuals as well as those with non-malignant conditions (pancreatic disease, heart disease, coagulation disorders, acute infection, or trauma) and malignancy at other sites have elevations in DR-70.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311829313\"><span class=\"h4\">Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ctDNA is the fraction of circulating DNA that is derived from a patient's cancer. CRCs shed DNA into the blood, and interest in using ctDNA as a sensitive indicator of relapse risk has grown as techniques to detect and quantify such DNA have improved. One report of 27 patients surgically treated for CRC revealed ctDNA postoperatively in all 14 relapsing patients but not in any of the nonrelapsing patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Of the 21 patients treated for localized disease, six had ctDNA detected within three months after surgery, and all relapsed, compared with only four of the remaining 15 patients. The six with a ctDNA relapse had significantly shorter relapse-free and overall survivals than did those with no ctDNA detected. On average, relapses were detected after 8.2 months by ctDNA, 12.3 months by CEA, and 16.9 months by CT. However, it is not clear that earlier detection resulted in a significantly greater opportunity for potentially curative treatment at the time of relapse. Additional study is needed.</p><p>A year 2018 joint review of the utility of ctDNA analysis in patients with cancer by ASCO and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) concluded there is no evidence of clinical utility and little evidence of clinical validity for ctDNA assays in early stage cancer, treatment monitoring, or residual disease detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Liver function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current evidence does not support routine assay of liver function tests (LFTs) for surveillance after treatment of CRC since they lack sensitivity to detect early recurrences.

As noted previously, systematic reviews and meta-analyses support a survival advantage for patients undergoing intensive as compared with non-intensive follow-up. However, the tests that were considered part of intensive follow-up differed in the five randomized trials included in these meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/12-15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15,18</a>], particularly with regard to CT scanning. In some cases, CT was performed of liver only, or pelvis only, and all studies used chest radiography alone to evaluate for pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, patients with any stage disease were included, and adjuvant chemotherapy was not always administered. Nevertheless, in one meta-analysis, the survival benefit from intensive surveillance was most pronounced in trials that used both CT imaging (every 3 to 12 months) and frequent measurement of CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Two other meta-analyses reported a survival benefit specifically with liver imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/25,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,81</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intensive versus less intense surveillance strategies'</a> above.)</p><p>Other data to support the utility of CT scanning come from studies evaluating surveillance policies in patients participating in adjuvant chemotherapy trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/6,10,80,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,80,82,83</a>]. In both United States Intergroup studies for colon cancer, CT was not mandated in the follow-up policy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>], while two European trials did include routine postoperative CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83</a>]. In the European studies, 32 and 44 percent of relapses were detected by imaging, respectively, and 38 and 46 percent of these patients proceeded to potentially curative resection, respectively. Only between 20 and 22 percent of all relapsed patients in both United States trials underwent potentially curative resection. Thus, routine rather than directed (ie, for evaluation of symptoms) postoperative CT scans are more likely to detect patients with isolated potentially resectable hepatic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p>There is less evidence for chest surveillance than for liver imaging, and none of the meta-analyses addressed thoracic imaging specifically.

The CT-detected group had a significantly longer median survival from the time of relapse as compared with the symptomatic group (26.4 versus 12.6 months), but not the CEA-detected group (19.2 months).

Because of missing data, primary analyses were performed with 125 patients (60 in the PET group versus 65 in the conventional group). The number of patients with a suspected recurrence was 44 (23 in the PET group and 21 in the conventional group), and recurrence was confirmed by biopsy or surgery in 15 patients in the PET group versus 12 in the conventional group (25 versus 18.5 percent), a difference that was not statistically significant. The PET group had a significantly shorter time to recurrence (12 versus 15 months), and recurrences were also more frequently cured by surgery in this group (10 versus 2). PET also detected three unsuspected second primary tumors (one gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor and two primary lung cancers); three patients had a false positive result, and 2 of 25 patients with a recurrence had a false negative result.</p><p>Until further data are available, PET scans should not be used as a component of routine surveillance.

Furthermore, neither randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15</a>] nor meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>] have shown a survival benefit by performing colonoscopy at annual or shorter intervals as compared with less frequent intervals (three or five years).</p><p>The inability to detect a disease-specific survival benefit from early detection of anastomotic recurrences may be related to the fact that the overwhelming majority of patients with endoscopically detected anastomotic recurrences are unresectable for cure. Because local recurrence rates for rectal cancer are generally higher than those seen in colon cancer, and early detection may lead to successful retreatment, there is a rationale for performing periodic examinations of the rectum by rigid or flexible proctoscopy sigmoidoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Proctosigmoidoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>On the other hand, periodic colonoscopy is of clear benefit for detecting metachronous cancers at a surgically curable stage as well as the prevention of metachronous cancers via identification and removal of adenomatous polyps.

Among three studies in which the number of colonoscopies performed could be determined, 157 colonoscopies were performed per metachronous cancer detected, a rate that compares favorably with the rate of prevalent cancer detected during screening colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>].

The decision to stop surveillance endoscopy should depend upon whether an individual patient's life expectancy and the likelihood of finding an advanced adenoma or second CRC justifies the risk and inconvenience of periodic endoscopy. At least some retrospective data suggest a low incidence of CRC detection and a relatively high rate of postprocedure hospitalization among elderly patients compared with younger individuals. In a retrospective cohort study of 27,763 patients &ge;50 years of age (4834 &ge;75 years of age) undergoing surveillance colonoscopy for a history of CRC or adenomatous polyps at a single integrated California health system, CRC incidence among elderly patients was significantly lower than that of younger individuals (0.24 versus 3.61 per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

However, that study failed to account for the protective effect of prior colonoscopy (ie, that the older patients had likely undergone more surveillance colonoscopies with the potential for removal of precancerous lesions).</p><p>Recommendations for ongoing surveillance in elderly individuals with a treated CRC are complicated by other factors such as how much residual colon is present after surgery, and how many (if any) adenomas were found in the previous one or two surveillance colonoscopies.

The posttreatment surveillance strategy consisted of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing every three months for the first year, and then every six months for five years; chest radiograph every six months for two years then annually, and colonoscopy at one year, and then every three years if the colon was free of neoplasia; CT scans were performed for symptoms, physical findings, or an increased CEA.</p><p>Five-year recurrence rates were higher in patients with later stage disease (36 versus 10 percent).

The key recommendations included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance should be guided by presumed risk of recurrence and functional status of the patient.

If the patient is not a surgical candidate or a candidate for systemic therapy because of severe comorbid conditions, surveillance tests should not be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance is especially important in the first two to four years after surgery, when the risk of recurrence is greatest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific recommendations for the elements of the surveillance strategy are outlined in the table, which also contrasts the ASCO recommendations with those of other expert groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment plan from the specialist should be sent to the patient&rsquo;s other providers, particularly the primary care physician, and it should have clear directions for appropriate follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the lack of high-quality evidence on secondary prevention in CRC survivors, it is reasonable to counsel patients on maintaining a healthy body weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE CARE FOR LONG-TERM SURVIVORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is known about the appropriate primary and preventive care of survivors as they transition from treatment into the period of active surveillance and then to long-term survivorship, or who should be responsible for providing that care. In the setting of breast cancer, randomized trial data provide evidence that primary care providers are able to monitor survivors for recurrence-related clinical events as well as cancer specialists, as long as they are advised of the appropriate surveillance and management strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1414441\"><span class=\"h2\">Coordination of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data that address the utility of generalist versus specialist care in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. However, in general, CRC survivors who are followed by generalists tend to receive more preventive care than do patients who are seen primarily by oncologists, while on the other hand, cancer-related screening may decrease as oncologists become less involved in survivor care. In addition, because many CRC survivors are elderly, primary care providers may be better equipped to address comorbidities that are often neglected among cancer survivors. These results suggest a need for a shared survivorship care plan in which the roles of the primary care physician and oncology specialist are explicitly outlined.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-adenomatous-polyposis-screening-and-management-of-patients-and-families\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial adenomatous polyposis: Screening and management of patients and families&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mutyh-associated-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MUTYH-associated polyposis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Screening and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-polyposis-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile polyposis syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lynch syndrome is an inherited disorder associated with CRC. Its prevalence among patients with CRC is between 1 and 5 percent. The minimum diagnostic criteria to suspect Lynch syndrome are controversial, but the possibility should be considered in patients fulfilling the revised Bethesda guidelines for testing colorectal tumors for Lynch syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965 \">table 6</a>). However, the sensitivity of these criteria for capturing all cases of Lynch syndrome is limited. Increasingly, universal testing of all CRCs for Lynch syndrome by assessment of microsatellite instability (MSI) or absence of expression of a mismatch repair protein (MMR) is advocated by expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">High levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) are the biologic footprint of cells that have deficient DNA repair capacity that may be inherited (Lynch syndrome) or acquired (most often through hypermethylation of the promoter region preventing protein transcription). In either case, the end result is silencing of genes governing mismatch repair. Deficient mismatch repair is the genetic abnormality underlying Lynch syndrome and is present in both the tumor and in germline DNA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Mismatch repair genes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other major inherited CRC syndrome is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This disorder is much less common than Lynch syndrome and is characterized by multiple polyps throughout the colon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-adenomatous-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The less common MAP is an autosomal recessive polyposis syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in the <em>MUTYH</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. MAP is currently the only known recessive hereditary colon cancer syndrome. The clinical phenotype is multiple polyps throughout the colon, but fewer than seen with FAP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mutyh-associated-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MUTYH-associated polyposis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Genetic testing for the responsible gene (the <em>APC</em> gene) in FAP, for germline mutations in mismatch repair genes in Lynch syndrome, and for the two most common <em>MUTYH</em> gene mutations found in MAP in the Caucasian population (Y179C and G396D), is available, and patients with CRC who meet these diagnostic criteria should undergo genetic counseling to discuss genetic testing. The demonstration of a mutated gene can then be used to screen the remainder of the family and identify those members who need intensive monitoring. The topic of screening for Lynch syndrome, FAP, and MAP, as well as recommendations for cancer surveillance for individuals who are found to have one of these syndromes, is addressed elsewhere.
