It is comprised of broad concepts that affect global life satisfaction, including good health, adequate housing, employment, personal and family safety, interrelationships, education, and leisure pursuits. For matters related to health care, QOL has been applied specifically to those life concerns that are most affected by health or illness, hence the term &quot;health-related quality of life&quot; (HRQL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The concept of HRQL emerged from the broader concept of general QOL, and is, by definition, more focused on aspects of life quality that are influenced by or that can influence one&rsquo;s health status directly. These aspects can include symptoms of disease and treatment side effects, treatment satisfaction, physical functioning and well-being, social functioning and life satisfaction, and mental health, including emotional well-being and cognitive functioning. HRQL does not typically include aspects of life that are often associated with the broader concept of QOL, such as income, financial resources, nutrition, and environmental conditions such as air quality, climate, political and personal freedoms, and public safety (crime). Some research has begun to look at some of these broader life QOL domains and their relationship with HRQL.</p><p>Specific measures to evaluate the outcome of a serious illness or its treatment include quantity and quality of life, and economic cost to the patient (ie, the financial burden of care). Although length of survival was previously considered the most important among these, the impact of illness on QOL has received increasing recognition. For more than 30 years, improvement in HRQL is one of two potential benefits that are considered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a basis for full approval of new anticancer drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More recently, the FDA released specific guidance for the development and validation of QOL measures that could be suitable for regulatory purposes. Further developed by FDA authors in 2016, the recommended QOL components for drug labeling purposes include disease-related symptoms, physical function, and patient-reported adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Historically, HRQL has been a fundamental concern of oncologic practice since 1949, when Karnofsky and Burchenal developed a clinical scale to quantify the functional performance of cancer patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Increasing interest in the systematic assessment of HRQL in cancer patients using standardized, self-administered measures has emerged over the past three decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and has become an important focus of benefit for newer therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], as well as a basis for documenting and compensating for quality cancer care.</p><p>HRQL is a particularly important issue for patients who are in the advanced stages of a serious life threatening illness. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible QOL for patients and their families facing serious illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Here we will discuss assessment of HRQL in patients with serious life-threatening medical illness, emphasizing malignant disease and palliative care patients. Issues specific to HRQL in patients with head and neck cancer and those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health-related quality of life in head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINING HRQL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health-related quality of life (HRQL) can be formally defined as: &quot;The extent to which one's usual or expected physical, emotional and social well-being are affected by a medical condition or its treatment&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This definition incorporates the two widely accepted aspects of quality of life: subjectivity and multidimensionality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>HRQL represents a subjective appraisal of the impact of illness or its treatment; individual patients with the same objective health status can report dissimilar HRQL due to unique differences in expectations and coping abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As a result, HRQL must be measured from the individual's viewpoint rather than that of outside observers (ie, caregivers or health care professionals) whenever possible. The importance of obtaining HRQL reports from patients, themselves, is highlighted by a substantial literature documenting disparate estimates of symptoms and HRQL between patients and their physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Multidimensionality is the other important component of HRQL. The multidimensionality of HRQL is reflected in the work of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cooperative Group, an NIH-funded national effort that has produced a comprehensive, conceptual framework of self-reported health for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98059 \">table 2</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98060 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Developed with the input of hundreds of people with a wide variety of medical conditions, the health care providers who treat them, members of the general population, and extensive literature reviews, the framework is divided into physical, mental, and social health. Each of these major components encompasses multiple subcomponents (eg, the mental health component is comprised of affect, behavior, and cognition). These subdomains are further divided (eg, negative affect is comprised of anxiety, depression, anger, experience of stress, and the negative psychosocial impact of illness). </p><p>An important point is that serious and life-threatening illness can also result in positive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] such as emotional and spiritual growth, greater closeness with family and friends, and an appreciation of one&rsquo;s inner strength. These psychosocial benefits are included in the Psychosocial Illness Impact &ndash; Positive domain of PROMIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The utility of the PROMIS system for patient-reported outcomes is discussed further below (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Combined instruments for patient-reported outcomes'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURING HRQL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vast array of validated and reliable questionnaires are available for assessment of HRQL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. They include generic health status instruments, generic illness instruments, and disease-specific instruments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Generic health status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generic health status questionnaires are applicable to all populations and can be completed by individuals both with and without medical illness. These instruments provide benchmarks for comparison across diverse groups, such as healthy and ill populations, or different age groups. Examples include the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) from the Medical Outcomes Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Generic illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generic illness instruments are applicable to populations with any medical illness or condition, and can be used to compare different illnesses, levels of disease severity, or types of interventions. Such cross-disease comparisons are increasingly important in the allocation of limited health care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition to measuring general health status, these instruments typically assess the individual's perception of the functional impact of the illness or disability. Examples include the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. NOTE:<strong> </strong>One of the authors on this topic (DC) has equity in FACIT.org.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease-specific</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-specific measures are designed to assess the HRQL of individuals with specific illnesses (eg, cancer, diabetes), specific types of treatment (eg, chemotherapy, lung transplant, palliative care), or specific symptoms (eg, nausea, urinary incontinence). Compared with other types of instruments, these measures provide a more detailed assessment for specific diseases and are also likely to be more sensitive to specific treatment-related changes in HRQL. Examples include the Diabetes Quality of Life instrument (DQOL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], the Functional Living Index - Cancer (FLIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General-7 (FACT-G7), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 15-Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. </p><p>One trend in HRQL research is to combine generic and disease-specific instruments, in order to fully cover important areas that may impact on HRQL. As an example, in one report of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the generic illness instrument was more sensitive to general health status and the presence of comorbidity, while the disease-specific measure was more sensitive to the degree of knee disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined instruments for patient-reported outcomes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">PROMIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (<a href=\"http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis&amp;token=hDyBhXQdVk422gHHSs8VgfwdF9mmCMW37qW0gDjNR6V264uSQLSthZhWOeXtx7aS8vSoiEF4QoXqoxJQyk7vga8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2833\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">PROMIS</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] presents a new set of multidimensional HRQL instruments that combine features of the three categories above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98059 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98060 \">table 3</a>). PROMIS instruments are applicable across chronic illness populations in addition to having cancer-specific instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Item banks for computer-adaptive testing and short forms exist for physical function, pain interference, pain behavior, pain intensity, pain quality, fatigue, sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms, dyspnea, sexual function and satisfaction, depression, anxiety, anger, alcohol use, smoking, substance use, psychosocial impact of illness, cognitive function, ability to participate in social roles and activities, satisfaction with participation in social roles and activities, companionship, emotional support, informational support, instrumental support, isolation, and global health in adults.</p><p>In addition, there are pediatric instruments for physical function (upper extremity, mobility), pain interference, pain intensity, pain behavior, pain quality, fatigue, physical activity, physical stress experience, strength impact, depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, cognitive function, life satisfaction, meaning and purpose, positive affect, psychological stress experiences, peer relationships, family relationships, asthma impact, and global health. Measures can be completed by self-report down to age eight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] or by a parent reporting on behalf of a child down to age five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>All of the PROMIS instruments were developed using rigorous qualitative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>] and quantitative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/15,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,39-41</a>] methods, including use of item response theory, an analytic strategy that allows for the creation of customized short forms and use of a common metric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although PROMIS instruments have had limited application in palliative care populations, the breadth of domain coverage suggests utility for research and clinical care in this population as well. This is supported by recent work demonstrating PROMIS measures predicting survival in patients receiving palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuro-QoL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders project (<a href=\"http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/neuro-qol&amp;token=pFULaKERUBccKD+GOGd9HnCkiGVCGuHn/UDp+xdDlNTIf6ZgxxVi3U4Z6dQkaPSiDUGrg570gTEF9Lw5SQ7wNNIFFOyDf/hterffiZ34wzQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2833\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Neuro-QoL</a>), was a similar effort to PROMIS, funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to develop and test HRQL instruments that are applicable across the many neurological conditions. Utilizing a methodology similar to PROMIS, these instruments have been validated in five adult and two pediatric diseases (stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease], multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, adult and pediatric epilepsy, and the muscular dystrophies). It is hoped that the resulting HRQL tools will be used to facilitate the comparison of results from clinical trials and other clinical research across conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Proxy or caregiver evaluations of HRQL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are situations (eg, children, elderly, cognitively impaired patient, end of life care settings with a very ill patient) where patient self-reported HRQL must be substituted by proxy assessment. Where it has been studied, there appears to be general agreement between the patient's assessment and that of family caregiver proxies in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-49</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] studies. Also, the possibility of bias related to the subjective burden of caring for the individual must be considered when the proxy is a caregiver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Partners, children, and parents can experience significant alterations in their emotional, social, and even physical well-being in response to the illness of a loved one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">UTILIZATION OF HRQL DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information regarding the impact of an illness or medical condition on HRQL can be put to use in several ways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials that compare two (or more) treatments often include a HRQL analysis as one means of determining overall clinical benefit, particularly when treatment-related side effects are considerable. Compared with the control therapy, the alternative treatment option may be associated with a variety of combinations of relative survival benefit and HRQL. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer survival with better HRQL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar survival but better HRQL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorter survival but better HRQL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer survival but with inferior HRQL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorter survival with an inferior HRQL</p><p/><p>Although no individual would purposely select a treatment that results in both shorter survival and a worse HRQL, improved HRQL during therapy may be perceived as sufficiently compelling (particularly during cancer treatment) to outweigh a somewhat shorter survival duration.</p><p>Improvement in HRQL as an end point in clinical research requires recruitment of sufficient numbers of subjects for a trial to have adequate power. Instruments measuring HRQL with a limited coefficient of variation can decrease the size of a trial needed and offer an important advantage in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Planning tools for future clinical care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because HRQL information can provide a detailed assessment of disease and treatment effects, and their global impact on the individual's daily life, it can be used as a planning tool for assessing the need for further treatment, rehabilitation, or palliative care.

For instance, a brief multi-dimensional HRQL instrument might be administered at every chemotherapy visit. The treating nurse or physician can then review the current HRQL for indications of problems and compare it with the HRQL from the previous visit. Significant changes can be flagged for follow-up by the physician or nurse. This may be of significant benefit in busy practices where there is not always sufficient time to ask the questions one would like. A quick glance at a standardized computer-generated printout of HRQL scores and changes from the last visit's scores could catch a problem that might otherwise be missed. In a study of patients with advanced lung cancer, acceptance of and compliance with weekly assessment of HRQL was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

With increasing interest in HRQL assessment in routine care, several centers have initiatives across conditions and technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of real-time capture, transfer, and feedback of patient-centered outcomes data included 16 studies, mostly randomized controlled trials with oncology patients, that met their inclusion criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that use of patient-centered outcome measures improved some care processes (eg, patient-provider communication about symptoms) and some outcomes, including patient and caregiver psychological wellbeing. However, the evidence for an effect on overall HRQL and symptom burden was mixed.</p><p>Routinely providing HRQL information to oncologists can improve patient-physician communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/56,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,62</a>]. There is a suggestion that this may have a positive effect on some aspects of HRQL. Although it has yet to be empirically demonstrated, it is also possible that early identification of problems through routine HRQL assessment could prevent costly emergency room visits or hospital admissions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Predicting treatment response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HRQL data can also be used to predict the outcome of treatment. As an example, in patients with metastatic lung cancer, pretreatment HRQL predicted the likelihood of an objective response to chemotherapy treatment, and the change in HRQL between baseline and six weeks after treatment initiation also predicted survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

The importance of this type of information for stratification of patients during random treatment assignment is obvious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment decision-making in advanced serious life-threatening illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolongation of life, without regard for the quality of that life, is not a universally desired goal. When considering aggressive, life-prolonging treatments and end of life decisions, it is necessary to consider each individual's assessment of what makes life worth living. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care#H11672099\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Illness understanding and care preferences'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care#H11672113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Religious, spiritual, and existential (transcendent) issues'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients are willing to consider aggressive and potentially toxic treatments despite slim chances of survival; medical issues do not always constitute the main factors considered. In one series, aggressive therapy was more likely to be accepted among patients with a positive sense of social well-being or children living at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a second report, 388 older adults were presented with 17 hypothetical decision situations depicting terminal and nonterminal conditions with a very low quality of life and asked to rank the acceptability of several end of life options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The majority chose striving to live and seeking active treatment over death, even if they had a poor HRQL characterized by pain, immobility, and extreme dependence on others. Psychosocial variables, including religiosity, values, and fear of death contributed significantly to the decision-making process, highlighting the complex relationship between HRQL and QOL (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'The influence of nonmedical issues'</a> below).</p><p>For patients with a serious, life threatening illness, the decision to continue potentially life-lengthening treatment is obviously a very individual one. However, what is also clear is that appropriate palliative care can improve HRQL by reducing symptom burden and decreasing interference with usual life activities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>An NIH-sponsored cooperative research group has been founded to study treatment-related issues that are specific to the setting of palliative and end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. This group has made tremendous progress in its first few years of operation, uniting and organizing collaborators in palliative care, and launching its first completed clinical trial, showing that stopping statin therapy in terminally ill patients is not only safe but may improve quality of life and reduce cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103517908\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of quality of health care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of health care quality to date has largely utilized measures that assess the process of care. These performance measures can include assessments such as the proportion of providers that conduct a foot exam in diabetic patients, or recommend or prescribe an indicated treatment for a specific condition. Increasingly, payers and providers are interested in additionally utilizing HRQL measures that capture outcomes of care. Patient-reported outcome performance measures (PRO-PMs) include assessments such as the level of patient-reported depressive symptoms, degree of physical function, pain, and sleep quality. The methodological issues related to the selection, administration, and use of PRO-PMs are beginning to be better understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES FOR HRQL STUDY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the progress in HRQL research over the last two decades, several challenges remain. As an example, the establishment of psychometrically valid instruments has been largely met in oncology; in contrast, evaluation of HRQL in other diseases is in varying stages of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], although efforts such as PROMIS and Neuro-QOL are encouraging. Challenges that extend across disciplines include the identification of what constitutes clinically significant differences and meaningful changes in HRQL, the development and testing of conceptual models linking medical and psychological variables to HRQL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], and the development of item banks and computer-adaptive tests (CAT) to measure HRQL in a way that permits comparison across diseases and treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining a clinically meaningful change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>What degree of change in HRQL is of sufficient magnitude to warrant a treatment modification by the physician? Identifying changes in HRQL that are clinically significant involves determining whether the change that is observed in response to an intervention is meaningful and important, or statistically significant yet clinically irrelevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p>One approach to answering this question is to compare changes in HRQL scores with global ratings of change in different life dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>] or in life stress units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, in one report, a minimally important difference (MID) was defined based upon patients' global ratings of change, and applied to three studies measuring dyspnea, fatigue, and emotional function in patients with chronic heart and lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The MID was represented by a mean change in score of approximately 0.5 per item on the HRQL instrument, when responses were presented on a seven point Likert scale.</p><p>Complementary approaches to this question have received considerable attention. For example, clinically-meaningful differences or changes can be calculated by comparison of HRQL score differences or changes to parallel differences or changes in meaningful anchors, such as the patient's global rating of change mentioned above or clinical measures relevant to a given condition (such as tumor response in oncology or hemoglobin change in anemic patients). Other important HRQL anchors used in oncology, for example, include disease <span class=\"nowrap\">stage/severity,</span> treatment status, progression-free survival, and performance status.</p><p>Distribution-based methods calculate an MID by applying a criterion of one-third to one half of the pooled standard deviation of the measure at the baseline assessment. Results from several studies indicate that similar estimates are obtained regardless of the method used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. In part because of this, the widespread use of a standard deviation to define meaningful group differences across HRQL measures has been advocated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Although this may be useful as a general guideline for clinicians who are not familiar with particular HRQL measures, more precise estimates can be obtained for specific instruments when they are used to calculate sample size for a research study or other similar purpose. In these cases, multiple methods for deriving a range of recommended MIDs may be most appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].</p><p>Another approach to aid in clinical interpretation of HRQL scores has been to identify meaningful cut-points (eg, the threshold at which time an oncologist may consider a referral for emotional distress or modification of pain medication). The successful establishment of meaningful cut-scores for symptoms (eg, mild, moderate, or severe) has been demonstrated in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>] and in patients with serious neurological conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Unlike MIDs, this approach recognizes that a change in score may have different meanings depending upon where in the range of scores it takes place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709047002\"><span class=\"h3\">Palliative care patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defining a clinically meaningful change can be particularly challenging for palliative care patients. People living with chronic, life-threatening illness often progress through specific phases of clinical worsening and increasing physical, mental, and social challenges. Furthermore, when people are severely ill or disabled, it can be difficult to simply obtain reliable responses to a long set of questions.&nbsp;For this reason, many have abbreviated questionnaires for use in end of life studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Yet, often disease progression is accompanied by a shift in priorities or life goals of the patient and family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/10,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,86</a>]. When this happens, it can have an effect on responses to self-report questionnaires about symptoms and functional abilities. Often, social, family, and spiritual issues become more important than they were previously. In fact, this sometimes results in the counter-intuitive finding that overall QOL is maintained, or even improved, even in the face of worsening physical symptoms and functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]</p><p>There are suggestions for measuring these emerging issues and how they might modify the value people place on what is clinically meaningful. For example, specific questions can be added to existing measurements such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-90</a>]. Another instrument, the Quality of Life at the End of Life instrument (QUAL-E), includes the domains of life completion and preparation for the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. </p><p>In addition, there have been many efforts to individualize HRQL to the individual, including tailoring the questions that are asked, weighting individual questions or domains for their relative importance to the patient, or allowing patients to select their most important concerns and tracking them over time.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this has proven difficult to implement; limited investigations suggest that weighting has little additional predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], and there are legitimate concerns about comparing one person&rsquo;s individualized score with that of another. Nonetheless, several such individualized instruments are available, including the Patient Generated Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] and the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">The influence of nonmedical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second challenge is to develop and test models of non-illness-related factors (eg, psychological, social, cultural, and economic issues) that might influence the impact of a particular level of impairment on HRQL. In one model, the amount of distress and dissatisfaction experienced by the patient as a result of the symptoms and functional limitations induced by illness and its treatment is filtered by individual factors, sociocultural influences, and available resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Other proposed models relate physiological variables, symptoms report, and physical functioning to overall HRQL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Evaluation of these interrelationships is critical to an understanding of what influences HRQL and the potential for modifying these factors through targeted interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150190047\"><span class=\"h3\">Language and culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nature of self-reported symptoms, function, and quality of life is such that perspectives and reporting are influenced by language and culture. Therefore, it is important when developing questions that their meaning is comparable across different languages and cultures.&nbsp;This is best accomplished through thoughtful writing of concepts so that they are easily translated, and then use of a translation methodology that checks and evaluates cross-cultural relevance and understandability. In some cases, simultaneous development of multiple language versions has been found to be an effective way of increasing comparability across languages and cultural groups.&nbsp;When multiple language versions are used in one study, if sample size permits, evaluation of the performance of each item relative to the others, language-by-language, can also be done. This is referred to as checking for differential item functioning (DIF) by language or cultural group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150190067\"><span class=\"h2\">Personality and individual differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological characteristics such as <span class=\"nowrap\">optimism/pessimism,</span> neuroticism, depression, and social desirability can influence the overall &quot;tone&quot; of an individual&rsquo;s response to questions.&nbsp;Typically, this is managed as a constant, underlying variable that is generally controlled within-person in a longitudinal change score, and balanced across groups when respondents are randomly assigned. Nevertheless, caution regarding personality influences on reporting is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H696452872\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiritual and existential wellbeing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spiritual wellbeing has been defined as a sense of meaning, peace, and connectedness with something larger than oneself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In the face of life-threatening illness, spirituality is often seen as a particularly effective resource for coping with physical symptoms and functional limitations. Conversely, spiritual distress or conflict can be particularly problematic, especially if it is prolonged. With a patient's agreement, chaplains, religious leaders, or spiritually attuned health care providers of many types can assist the patient in exploring sources of distress and resolution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influence-of-spirituality-and-religiousness-on-outcomes-in-palliative-care-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influence of spirituality and religiousness on outcomes in palliative care patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Existential distress (&quot;why me,&quot; &quot;what does my life mean if it might end soon&quot;) can negatively affect HRQL to an extent similar to physical symptoms, such as pain. Some HRQL assessments, notably the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>] (and its revised version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]), include an existential wellbeing subscale. As an example, respondents rate whether they have been able to achieve their goals, whether life is worthwhile, and the extent to which every day feels like a burden or a gift. Also, at least one investigator has begun to document the positive effect of an intervention called &quot;meaning-centered psychotherapy&quot; specifically to address the existential questions and distress that can be wrought by a fatal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

Few relevant publications appear within the psychology literature, despite the rapid growth of the field over the last 20 years. One possibility is that the focus on HRQL as an outcome indicator for medical illness and its treatment has forced the publication of pertinent studies in the medical rather than psychology literature.</p><p>However, the field of psychology has made valuable contributions to the field of HRQL research. The development of valid and reliable instruments to measure the patients' perspective of their illness and treatment was made possible by the demonstration of their psychometric properties; this is largely the work of psychologists. With the increasing emphasis on the evaluation of HRQL among populations with mental illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-health-related-quality-of-life-hrql-in-patients-with-a-serious-life-threatening-illness/abstract/95,99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,99-101</a>], it appears likely that the next decade will witness a growing recognition of HRQL research by psychology, as the past decade has shown its growth within medicine and health care in general.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of life is comprised of broad concepts that affect global life satisfaction. For matters related to health care, quality of life has been applied specifically to those life concerns that are most affected by health or illness, hence the term &quot;health-related quality of life&quot; (HRQL). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>A formal definition of HRQL is: &quot;The extent to which one's usual or expected physical, emotional and social well-being are affected by a medical condition or its treatment&quot;. This definition incorporates the two widely accepted aspects of quality of life: subjectivity and multidimensionality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Defining HRQL'</a> above.)</p><p>A vast array of validated and reliable questionnaires are available for assessment of HRQL in patients with a serious life-threatening illness, including generic health status instruments, generic illness instruments, disease-specific instruments, and combined instruments such as Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98059 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98060 \">table 3</a>).
