Thus, decreased maximal exercise capacity is associated with decreased patient survival. Exercise training may have a variety of benefits, including an improvement in quality of life, reduced hospitalization, and improved survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The methods used to measure exercise capacity, the factors that limit exercise capacity in HF, and the use of measurement of peak exercise capacity (also called functional exercise testing) to predict prognosis will be reviewed here. This discussion is generally consistent with the 2000 recommendations published by the European Society of Cardiology and the 2014 update including the expanding role of cardiopulmonary testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This discussion is also consistent with the 2010 clinician&rsquo;s guide to cardiopulmonary testing and the 2012 clinical recommendations for specific populations, including HF, published by the American Heart Association (AHA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the effects of exercise training in patients with HF are discussed separately.

As a result, exercise tolerance is determined by three factors: pulmonary gas exchange; cardiovascular performance, including the peripheral vascular tree; and skeletal muscle metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Peak VO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise capacity can be quantitated clinically by measurement of oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (Vco<sub>2</sub>), and minute ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These parameters are measured during exercise with rapidly responding gas analyzers capable of breath-by-breath determination of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in inspired and expired air, respectively. The maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) eventually reaches a plateau despite increasing workload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62094 \">figure 1</a>). Not surprisingly, Vo<sub>2</sub>max has a strong linear correlation with both cardiac output and skeletal muscle blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65079 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;</a>). The peak Vo<sub>2</sub>divided by the heart rate (peakVo<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/HR)</span> is called the oxygen pulse and is an indirect measure of stroke volume.</p><p>The relationship between cardiac output and O<sub>2</sub> uptake (or oxygen consumption) also forms the basis for the Fick equation used to measure cardiac output:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Cardiac output &#160; = &#160; O<sub>2</sub> uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>) &#160;&divide; &#160;Arteriovenous O<sub>2</sub> difference (A-V O<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory threshold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ventilatory threshold (VT), formerly referred to as the anaerobic threshold (AT), is another index used to estimate exercise capacity. It is defined as the point at which minute ventilation increases disproportionately relative to Vo<sub>2</sub>, a response that is generally seen at 60 to 70 percent of Vo<sub>2</sub>max (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62094 \">figure 1</a>). The VT is a reflection of the disproportionate increase in lactic acid production by working muscles. It can be used to distinguish between noncardiac (pulmonary or musculoskeletal) and cardiac causes of exercise limitation, since patients who fatigue prior to reaching VT are likely to have a noncardiac problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Six-minute walk test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The six-minute walk test is a useful, simple, and inexpensive test that correlates with Vo<sub>2</sub>max and outcomes and has been used in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

As in normal subjects, peak Vo<sub>2</sub> in HF is directly related to peak exercise cardiac output and muscle blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65079 \">figure 2</a>). However, the inability to appropriately increase cardiac output results in an insufficient increase in perfusion to exercising muscle, which can cause early anaerobic metabolism, muscle fatigue, and eventual muscle wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

This abnormality may contribute to the symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.</p><p>The diaphragm shows a different adaptation from skeletal and respiratory muscle.

Even in the absence of pulmonary congestion, HF is associated with impaired pulmonary diffusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and an exaggerated increase in minute ventilation in response to exercise, out of proportion to the increase in carbon dioxide production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Although the current shortage of organs has resulted in hearts being placed in the sickest patients who cannot perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test, the 2012 AHA statement on special populations continues to support peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and minute ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">(VE)/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope as criteria for transplant eligibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It must be emphasized that the value for peak Vo<sub>2</sub> should be interpreted in the context of the patient's age, lifestyle, goals, and current therapies, such as beta blockers and resynchronization therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

Factors that can prematurely terminate the test must be excluded, including significant peripheral muscular deconditioning, peripheral artery disease, arthritis, angina pectoris, or low patient motivation. In such situations, patients are unable to achieve Vo<sub>2</sub>max. The proper interpretation of the peak Vo<sub>2</sub> requires that the patient achieve the ventilatory threshold (VT), indicating that the level of exercise performed exceeded that which can be supported by the cardiovascular system on an aerobic basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak Vo<sub>2</sub> may be less useful in women than in men. The influence of gender on both peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and its prognostic value was illustrated in a series of 594 patients with advanced HF (28 percent women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although women were younger (49 versus 53 years in men) and had better systolic function (mean LVEF 29 versus 25 percent), the mean peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was lower in women than in men (14.0 versus 16.6 percent, respectively). Despite the lower peak Vo<sub>2</sub>, women had a higher one-year transplant-free survival (94 versus 81 percent). A better measure of exercise capacity in women may be the percent predicted peak Vo<sub>2</sub> for age and body weight. In the HF-ACTION trial, the peak Vo<sub>2</sub> for women did correlate with New York Heart Association class but was considerably lower than that for the men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absolute peak Vo<sub>2</sub> is also influenced by such factors as age and body weight. The percent predicted peak Vo<sub>2</sub> corrects for these factors and may be a more accurate determinant of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. HF centers have been using the percent predicted peak Vo<sub>2</sub> to assess prognosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise oscillatory ventilation is often observed in patients with severe HF and may make the determination of peak Vo<sub>2</sub> more challenging. However, oscillatory ventilation itself may be a marker of more severe disease and worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p>HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF in older individuals, particularly women, and is increasing in prevalence, comprising around 40 percent of admissions for decompensation. Symptoms for patients with HFpEF are predominantly those of exercise intolerance including dyspnea and fatigue and are nearly identical to those of HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). However, the use of cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing to elucidate the cause(s) of exercise intolerance for HFpEF patients is not as widely investigated nor accepted in the clinical setting. While the multiple sources of exercise intolerance have been extensively studied in HFrEF, those of HFpEF are less well-accepted or studied. Some work has shown that CPX variables are equally abnormal in HFpEF patients compared with HFrEF patients when matched by clinical characteristics and that the Vo<sub>2</sub> can predict outcomes in this population, including readmissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In addition, there seems to be a correlation between peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and other physiologic variables, such as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Given that the Fick equation states that Vo<sub>2</sub> is related to cardiac output (CO) and peripheral oxygen extraction (arteriovenous O<sub>2</sub> difference), it has been assumed that impairment in CO accounts for the exercise intolerance of HFpEF. However, in HFpEF patients, the source of impaired Vo<sub>2</sub> may be more strongly related to abnormal arteriovenous O<sub>2</sub> difference with reduced maximal oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Some studies have now shown that the combination of the <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope added to the peak Vo<sub>2</sub> may better predict outcome. Others have reported that the ratio is superior to peak Vo<sub>2</sub> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is general agreement that the measurement of <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> during the entire exercise time is more physiologic. The <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope is discussed further below.

In a retrospective analysis of 440 patients from a randomized controlled trial with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF, baseline distance significantly predicted mortality and hospitalization; for each 100 m increase in distance walked, the hazard ratio was 0.58 and 0.85, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In HF-ACTION, changes in patient-reported health status by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) were weakly correlated with changes in functional capacity. A 5 point improvement in KCCQ was associated with a 112 m improvement in six-minute walk distance and a 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> increase in peak Vo<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32496488\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In HF ACTION, the most powerful predictor of the primary end point (death or all cause hospitalization) or death at median 2.5-year follow-up was exercise duration on a standardized baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test (Modified Naughton protocol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32496435\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory efficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A possible alternative in patients who cannot achieve Vo<sub>2</sub>max is measurement of the ventilatory efficiency, ie, ventilation-to-carbon dioxide production ratio in early exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. During cardiopulmonary exercise testing, a close linear relationship exists between the production of CO<sub>2</sub> (Vco<sub>2</sub>) and minute ventilation (VE). The slope of the regression line relating CO<sub>2</sub> production and minute ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">(VE/Vco<sub>2</sub>)</span> can be used to describe the ventilatory response to exercise.

A <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> regression line slope of &gt;34 is associated with reduced cardiac output during exercise, increased pulmonary artery wedge pressures, and reduced survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/42,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46</a>]. In one report, patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope above 34 had more severe HF with significantly reduced survival during 18-month follow-up (69 versus 95 percent for those with lower values) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59902 \">figure 7</a>). In addition, an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope adds incremental prognostic value to both Vo<sub>2</sub>max [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>] and the anaerobic threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], while a value above 44.7 adds incremental prognostic value to a low chronotropic index, which correlates with the peak heart rate achieved with exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66454 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].<br/><br/>An increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">VE/Vco<sub>2</sub></span> slope is also predictive of outcome in patients with preserved exercise capacity.

Severe ventricular ectopy (defined as ventricular triplets, sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular flutter, polymorphic VT, or ventricular fibrillation) was present in 140 patients (7 percent) during recovery. At three years, patients with severe ventricular ectopy after exercise had a significantly greater mortality rate than those without this arrhythmia (37 versus 22 percent). The increase in risk was seen both in patients with an implantable defibrillator (ICD) and in those without an ICD, suggesting that ventricular ectopy is an indicator of the risk of disease progression rather than just the risk of future arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The prognostic significance of ICD shocks in patients with HF is discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF EXERCISE HEMODYNAMICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although peak Vo<sub>2</sub> is one of the most important prognostic variables, direct assessment of exercise hemodynamics may improve the prognostic evaluation of patients with HF.
