Achieving virologic suppression can be difficult for HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant virus; however, advances in drug development have enabled great progress in the treatment of this patient population, even among those who have resistance to one or two classes of antiretroviral agents. </p><p>This topic will discuss how to select a combination antiretroviral therapy regimen for treatment-experienced patients who are failing therapy. Topic reviews that provide an overview of drug resistance testing and discuss how to evaluate treatment-experienced patients failing therapy are presented elsewhere.

Maintaining an undetectable viral load helps prevent disease progression, improve survival, prevent the emergence of drug-resistant virus, and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. </p><p>Minimizing the viral load is best achieved with the use of an ART regimen that consists of two to three fully active agents from at least two different classes of drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among patients with virologic failure and drug-resistant virus, this goal can still be achieved even if fewer than two to three active agents are used; however, the likelihood of virologic suppression depends upon the drugs used and number and types of drug-resistant mutations that are present. </p><p>Patients with drug-resistant virus who are failing an initial regimen that includes a first-line <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleoside/nucleotide</span> reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), or a pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitor (PI) are likely to achieve viral suppression with their subsequent regimen. These first-line regimens are less likely to result in highly resistant virus compared with older regimens that were less potent. For patients with drug-resistant virus who have failed multiple regimens, the treatment goal is still to decrease the viral load to below the level of detection, and if this is not attainable, to the lowest level possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442061086\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS BY CLASS AND ABBREVIATIONS USED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common names and abbreviations of currently available antiretroviral agents are listed by class in a separate table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60927 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H495152\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with virologic failure includes an assessment of adherence to the failing regimen as well as the HIV resistance profile. The presence of resistant virus is determined through the results of resistance tests (eg, genotype, phenotype) and the ART treatment history. For patients requiring a change in their regimen, the resistance profile and the patient&rsquo;s underlying comorbidities (eg, kidney, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders) impact which agents to use. These patients should be managed in consultation with an expert HIV provider. A detailed discussion of the initial evaluation of patients failing their ART regimen is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-treatment-experienced-patient-failing-hiv-therapy#H1667948784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the treatment-experienced patient failing HIV therapy&quot;, section on 'Initial assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180580646\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITHOUT DRUG-RESISTANT VIRUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patients will have virologic failure without the presence of drug-resistant virus. These patients should first be assessed for adherence, drug-drug interactions (eg, proton pump inhibitors with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a>), or drug-food interactions (eg, rilpivirine needing to be taken with food). If necessary, the regimen can be modified to another first-line regimen.

There is increasing evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> with two NRTIs may have similar properties, allowing this regimen to be considered as well.

The selection of HIV therapy in the context of drug resistance can be challenging and should generally be undertaken in consultation with an HIV specialist. When choosing a new regimen, it is important to evaluate the patient's past antiretroviral therapy (ART) history, as well as the results of previous and current genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phenotype drug resistance tests, to determine which agents are likely to be fully or partially active.

However, if treatment choices are limited due to multidrug-resistant virus, these comorbidities may have less impact on the choice of regimen as compared with those who have more treatment options.

Decreased drug susceptibility to a pharmacologically boosted PI generally requires the accumulation of multiple mutations. Thus, a pharmacologically boosted PI can have full or partial activity depending upon the number and type of mutations present. PI-associated mutations are classified as either primary (major) or secondary (minor), and resistance to one PI does not necessarily confer resistance to all of the PIs. More detailed discussions of PI resistance are found elsewhere.

We use a NRTI combination even if there is evidence of nucleoside resistance since the addition of these agents appears to improve the durability of virologic suppression when a fully active pharmacologically boosted PI is used to treat patients with virologic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].

Alternatively, a regimen that includes at least two, and preferably three, fully active agents from at least two drug classes can be used. (See <a href=\"#H105696234\" class=\"local\">'Overview of specific antiretroviral agents'</a> below.)</p><p>For such patients, additional testing may be needed to determine if fully or partially active drugs in existing classes are available.

Genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing can be useful to determine their potential role in a subsequent regimen if the patient is receiving these drugs when resistance testing is performed.

These patients often have CXCR4-using viruses and may have only an INSTI as a fully active agent.

The benefit of continuing a partially suppressive regimen may be due, in part, to highly resistant virus often being less fit.

We generally discontinue non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and T-20 if they are being used.

We recommend replacing the NNRTI with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> or a pharmacologically boosted protease inhibitor (PI) as the new third agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H202330389\" class=\"local\">'NNRTI-containing regimens'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> as the third agent if there is at least one active NRTI that can be included in the new regimen and there is no evidence of INSTI resistance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If tenofovir and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> are both active, we prefer a tenofovir-containing NRTI combination (ie, tenofovir-emtricitabine). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If genotype testing is not available, or if there are no fully active NRTIs, we suggest that a pharmacologically boosted PI be used as the third agent instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). High quality clinical trial data support the use of a pharmacologically boosted PI in this setting, while there is limited data regarding dolutegravir in this population. The choice of which NRTIs to use is based upon convenience and tolerability rather than resistance patterns. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients failing an initial NNRTI-containing regimen who are unable to tolerate a first-line NRTI combination, we recommend treatment with a pharmacologically boosted PI plus an INSTI (eg, boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>), rather than a pharmacologically boosted PI plus either a second-line NRTI regimen or a different nucleoside-sparing regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Second-line NRTIs are associated with significant toxicity, and there is less clinical trial data supporting a different nucleoside-sparing regimen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who experience virologic failure with drug-resistant virus while receiving an initial regimen that contains a first-line NRTI combination plus an INSTI, we suggest the NRTIs be continued, but the INSTI be switched to a pharmacologically boosted PI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A nucleoside-sparing regimen with a pharmacologically boosted PI plus an INSTI should only be used if there is documented evidence of INSTI susceptibility and close follow up. (See <a href=\"#H3786520507\" class=\"local\">'INSTI-containing regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients rarely develop drug-resistant virus while taking an initial regimen that contains a pharmacologically boosted PI. However, a minority of individuals will develop virus with resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>. Most patients failing a pharmacologically boosted PI are doing so because of poor adherence, and we typically continue their initial regimen and work with the patient to improve their ability to take daily therapy. However, if the patient is experiencing side effects, an effort should be made to switch to an alternative regimen that includes a better tolerated pharmacologically boosted PI or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. (See <a href=\"#H202330470\" class=\"local\">'A pharmacologically boosted PI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have failed multiple regimens, our approach is typically defined by the activity of a pharmacologically boosted PI and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. However, for certain patients, additional tests (eg, those that assess for T-20 resistance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of CCR5 tropic virus) may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H180580730\" class=\"local\">'Patients who have failed multiple regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant virus, we obtain viral load testing four weeks after initiating the new regimen. We then continue to monitor the HIV RNA level at four- to eight-week intervals until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection. (See <a href=\"#H1761654081\" class=\"local\">'Viral load monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a minority of patients, full virologic suppression is not achievable due to multiple drug resistance or intolerance. For such patients, we typically continue ART even if a new fully suppressive regimen is not available. (See <a href=\"#H495538\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with incomplete viral suppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Meena Lagnese, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents.
