Primary VZV infection results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella, or chickenpox. Endogenous reactivation of latent VZV typically results in a localized skin infection known as herpes zoster, or shingles. Varicella is generally a mild disease in children, although serious complications can sometimes occur (eg, secondary bacterial skin infections and pneumonia). Complications from VZV infection are more common in neonates, adults, or immunocompromised persons.</p><p>Because varicella is highly contagious and may cause serious disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and infectious disease experts have published recommendations regarding the prevention of VZV among health care personnel, isolation of patients with VZV infection, and the management of patients and health care personnel exposed to VZV. Issues specific to infection control and care of exposed health care personnel are discussed below. </p><p>The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of VZV have changed significantly since the introduction of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a>. These issues, as well as the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of varicella infection are discussed elsewhere.

This is particularly true of patients who present with varicella, compared to those with zoster, who are generally less infectious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although varicella in healthy adults is often a relatively benign disease, it may be associated with serious complications, such as pneumonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe complications, including death, may occur in immunocompromised patients and neonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection in pregnant women may lead to congenital varicella syndrome or neonatal varicella. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster virus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF VIRAL TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the only known hosts of VZV infection. VZV is transmitted primarily from person-to-person by the droplet and airborne routes, and occurs most efficiently when there is close contact. VZV is extremely labile and is therefore unlikely to be transmitted by inanimate objects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period of varicella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period for varicella ranges from 8 to 21 days, but most patients develop disease between days 14 and 16. Patients with varicella become infectious 24 to 48 hours prior to the onset of rash. Normal hosts remain infectious for approximately five days after the onset of the rash, while immunocompromised hosts may remain infectious for a more prolonged period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary attack rates of VZV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The secondary attack rate of varicella among susceptible persons in the household setting is about 85 percent. Comparable data in hospital settings are not available.</p><p>Herpes zoster, the reactivation of VZV, is also infectious, although analysis of household contacts suggests that the risk of transmission is only one-third that of varicella.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nosocomial transmission of VZV is well documented from both persons with varicella infection or reactivation disease with herpes zoster.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission from persons with varicella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varicella may be introduced into the hospital by patients, staff, or visitors with either clinically evident infection or during the incubation phase of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Nosocomial transmission of varicella appears to be primarily through the airborne route based on cases among staff and patients who had no direct contact with the index case. Epidemiologic and tracer studies have also confirmed that exposure to airflow from rooms occupied by patients with varicella is a major risk factor for the acquisition of infection among susceptible hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, alternative modes of transmission must be considered, as one hospital outbreak was attributed to varicella exposure during the course of an autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Transmission can even occur among previously vaccinated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. As an example, an outbreak of varicella was described in a population of pediatric cancer patients in a tertiary pediatric facility. Over approximately 16 days, varicella was detected in seven children (the index case, five secondary cases, and one tertiary case) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the seven identified cases, four appeared to represent &quot;breakthrough disease&quot; in previously vaccinated children. An outbreak of breakthrough varicella was also described among patients in a health care facility, where most individuals had neurologic deficits and were receiving rehabilitative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A detailed discussion of breakthrough varicella is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-chickenpox-primary-varicella-infection#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of chickenpox (primary varicella infection)&quot;, section on 'Breakthrough varicella'</a>.) </p><p>In contrast, transmission of varicella to term infants in the hospital nursery is rare because of transplacental passage of protective maternal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The management of neonates exposed to varicella is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Management of exposure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission from persons with zoster</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of zoster among patients with altered immune function may be up to 10-fold higher than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such patients are frequently hospitalized leading to possible nosocomial exposure. Exposure to dermatomal or disseminated zoster has led to clinical varicella in the hospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As an example, a hospital outbreak of varicella was reported in four adult patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who were treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The patients developed varicella after exposure to a patient with lymphoma who had zoster. Varicella occurred despite all patients having detectable serum anti-varicella zoster virus IgG antibodies before chemotherapy. This outbreak emphasizes the need to place immunocompromised patients with zoster on airborne precautions.</p><p>Nosocomial transmission from localized zoster in immunocompetent hosts has rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; and when these cases do occur, it is felt that transmission commonly results from direct contact with skin lesions. However, there have been reports suggesting that aerosolized virus from skin lesions, and possibly from the respiratory tract, may cause infection, even in those who have no direct patient contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one long-term care facility, a small outbreak of varicella was reported after a case of herpes zoster was diagnosed in one of the nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Clinical samples were collected from three case patients; genotypic analysis showed that the identical varicella-zoster strain was present in all three cases. Furthermore, high concentrations of VZV DNA were detected in environmental samples from the room of the herpes zoster case patient. Two of the three patients did not have any known contact with the index case while the third, a health care provider, had changed her linens. This case is notable since the index case was placed on contact precautions within 24 hours, was appropriately diagnosed and treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, and her rash was covered with gauze and clothing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case report, recurrent varicella occurred in a seropositive clinician 14 days after examination of an immunocompetent patient with herpes zoster ophthalmicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The clinician wore gloves at the time of the encounter but did lift bandages to examine the patient, who had initiated antiviral therapy less than 12 hours before. </p><p/><p>Varicella-zoster virus DNA has been found to widely contaminate the rooms of patients with dermatomal zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>] and has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the surface of gauze dressings and in room air purifier filters, supporting the failure of gauze dressing to completely prevent aerosolization of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These findings have implications for infection control measures which are addressed below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Isolation precautions for patients with herpes zoster'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF VARICELLA AMONG HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To prevent the transmission of varicella to health care personnel, we agree with the Advisory Committee on Immunization <span class=\"nowrap\">Practices/United</span> States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Hospital Infections Control Practices Advisory <span class=\"nowrap\">Committee/CDC,</span> the American Medical Association, and the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), all of whom recommend that all health care personnel (HCP) be immune to VZV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/2,7,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,17-19</a>]. Health care personnel are defined as all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and include (but are not limited to) clinicians, nurses, therapists, technicians, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students, trainees, contractual staff, and persons (eg, clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, billing, and volunteers) not directly involved in patient care but potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from health care personnel and patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale for immunizing susceptible health care personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine varicella immunization with two doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> is extremely effective in preventing varicella infection in children and adults and is associated with minimal side effects (eg, pain at injection site).

The CDC recommends that &quot;only health care personnel with evidence of immunity to varicella should care for patients who have confirmed or suspected varicella or herpes zoster&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishing susceptibility to infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care personnel should be screened for VZV immunity at the time of initial employment; those without evidence of immunity (ie, previous varicella, herpes zoster, or appropriate immunization) should be immunized if there are no contraindications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105431 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Active immunization of susceptible health care personnel'</a> below.)</p><p>According to the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACIP/CDC,</span> evidence of immunity for HCP includes any of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Written documentation of vaccination with two doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease.

In contrast, for persons reporting a history of, or reporting with, an atypical or mild case, they recommend assessment by a physician (or their designee), and one of the following: an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case, or evidence of laboratory confirmation if it was performed at the time of acute disease. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACIP/CDC</span> does not consider a patient as having a valid history of disease when such documentation is lacking since other diseases might mimic mild atypical varicella. </p><p>However, the sensitivity of a self-reported history of varicella or zoster was demonstrated in a seroprevalence study of 413 HCP in the United States, where 96 percent of those with a history of VZV infection had positive VZV antibody titers, regardless of when they were born [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, we also consider a patient-reported history of varicella as evidence of immunity. </p><p>Evidence of immunity for HCP differs somewhat from other patients. As an example, birth before 1980 is not considered sufficient evidence of immunity in HCP, although in other settings this criterion can been used. A discussion of varicella immunity in other populations where vaccination is being considered is found elsewhere.

This is because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> is not 100 percent effective in preventing infection, and providing consistent recommendations helps ensure adherence to these precautions which provide respiratory protection.

In all of these situations, the door to the room should remain closed except when personnel are entering or leaving the room.</p><p>For exposed sero-susceptible patients, we agree with the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics which suggest isolation of hospitalized patients using these precautions from the eighth day after the first exposure to the 21st day after the date of the last exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolation precautions for patients with herpes zoster</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CDC recommends that all patients with disseminated zoster and immunocompromised patients with dermatomal zoster be placed in the same isolation precautions as those with varicella described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the CDC recommends that HCP who care for immunocompetent patients with dermatomal zoster use standard precautions alone, without airborne and contact isolation precautions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-control-of-varicella-zoster-virus-in-hospitals/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>].

Varicella is generally a mild disease in children, but can cause serious infection in neonates, adults, or immunocompromised persons. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of varicella is important in health care facilities since varicella-zoster virus is highly contagious. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Importance of infection control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period of varicella ranges from 8 to 21 days after exposure, but most patients develop disease between days 14 and 16. Patients with varicella become infectious 24 to 48 hours prior to the onset of rash. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles of viral transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosocomial transmission of VZV is well documented from either persons with clinical varicella infection or herpes zoster, although the rates of transmission are much higher from patients with varicella. VZV appears to be transmitted primarily person-to-person by the droplet and airborne route and occurs most efficiently when there is close contact. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nosocomial transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosocomial varicella has also occurred among staff and patients who had no direct contact with the index case, supporting airborne transmission as a mode of spread.
