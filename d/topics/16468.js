For patients with the disorders listed above, clinical relevance is established by the presence of <strong>both</strong> of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms upon natural exposure to the allergen &ndash; It is sometimes easy to determine if patients have symptoms upon exposure (eg, symptoms upon intermittent exposure to cats), although in other situations, it is inferred when the patient has known exposure to an allergen and a temporal pattern of symptoms that is consistent with occurrence of that allergen, such as rhinitis and conjunctivitis during tree pollen season.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>And</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to that allergen, demonstrated either through allergen skin testing or serum tests for allergen-specific IgE.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Have other measures been maximized?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should ensure that the patient has maximized environmental control measures and is on an optimal medication regimen. If the patient has not been compliant with medications, the reasons for this should be explored in-depth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-avoidance-in-the-treatment-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SCIT is usually recommended for the treatment of allergic respiratory disease only after a period of pharmacologic management and observation. Medications are relatively easy for most patients to use, and when effective, they provide relief more rapidly than immunotherapy. A period of observation also allows the clinician to monitor the patient's disease over time, which is particularly important for adults with new-onset asthma in whom the differential should include other disorders that may present with respiratory symptoms (eg, other pulmonary conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough caused by chronic rhinosinusitis). These conditions should be considered first before initiating SCIT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Is current management suboptimal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the above questions have been addressed, it is appropriate to consider a trial of allergen immunotherapy in patients with significant allergic disease, for whom management is suboptimal for any of the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent symptoms on a seasonal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perennial basis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inadequate or partial response to environmental control and pharmacotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncompliance with maintenance medication regimen or suboptimal use of medication devices (eg, nasal sprays or inhalers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects related to medication use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost burden associated with chronic medication use</p><p/><p>The indications for SCIT are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78962 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019648206\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to a specialist in allergy and immunology should be sought for patients for whom immunotherapy may be appropriate. <span class=\"nowrap\">Allergists/immunologists</span> are trained in the interpretation of diagnostic tests for specific allergies, decisions about the allergens to be employed in immunotherapy, and formulation of allergen extracts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIABLES IN THE PRACTICE OF SCIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies examining the efficacy of SCIT are confounded by several factors, and it is helpful to have historical perspective about some of these. Variables in the practice of SCIT include differing approaches to administration around the world, differences in production methods, the lack of standardized measures of clinically meaningful efficacy, and until recently, a need for definitions of effective doses and validated assessment tools. These issues are being systematically addressed over time, although consensus about the optimal means of assessing efficacy has not been reached.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88724525\"><span class=\"h2\">One or multiple allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One important variable in the administration of SCIT is the use of a single or multiple allergens. Specifically, <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> specialists in the United States generally administer mixtures of all of the major relevant allergens (or a representative of each group of allergens) to which the patient has been shown to be sensitive. In contrast, it is common in Europe to administer only the one or two allergens that appear to cause the most symptoms for that individual patient, under the assumption that immunizing the patient against one allergen can reduce overall allergic reactivity. The question of whether immunotherapy using a single allergen can confer cross-desensitization to unrelated allergens has been addressed directly in a small number of trials, and benefit is questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A landmark study was a three-year randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 87 patients allergic to both grass and ragweed pollen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The group receiving preseasonal ragweed immunotherapy showed significant improvement in symptoms during ragweed season compared with the placebo group, as expected. In contrast, neither group received grass immunotherapy, and no improvements in symptom diaries were reported by either group during the grass pollen season. The clinical effect was paralleled by an increase in post-treatment IgG &quot;blocking antibody&quot; titers against ragweed. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to grass pollen was not assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial of 20 adults allergic to both dust mite and timothy grass pollen, subjects underwent three years of SCIT with one allergen or the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both sensitivity during conjunctival challenge and immunologic changes demonstrated that immunotherapy was allergen-specific, although there was significant loss to follow-up and small numbers of patients completing the trial.</p><p/><p>A related issue is whether multiple allergens can be given simultaneously without compromising efficacy by diluting any single allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The effectiveness of using multiple allergens has not been extensively analyzed, since most of the studies of SCIT efficacy have used a single allergen. One literature review of 11 trials of SCIT found that the use of either one or two allergens was effective, but controlled trials involving higher numbers of allergens are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88724531\"><span class=\"h2\">Composition of allergen extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variation in the composition of extracts used for immunotherapy has also been a problem historically. Efforts are underway to &quot;standardize&quot; important aeroallergens, which is a process that ensures the composition and potency of specific extracts. The use of standardized allergens should further improve the consistency and quality of allergen immunotherapy. The first aeroallergen defined and standardized by major protein content (antigen E, later designated Amb a 1) was ragweed, a dominant seasonal allergen in North America. The subsequent development of immunoassays to the major allergen allowed for the design of studies that helped define the therapeutic mechanisms of immunotherapy. In addition, clinical studies provided solid evidence for efficacy and safety with properly administered dosing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/1,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-15</a>]. An explanation of the standardization process and lists of standardized extracts are found elsewhere.

It has been established that there is an effective dose range for most allergens, and a coordinated international effort is ongoing to define that range for each of the important aeroallergens, although the process is far from complete. Prior to efforts to determine appropriate doses, &quot;maximally tolerated doses&quot; (MTD) was an accepted approach to SCIT. A patient's MTD was defined by that dose which caused an untoward allergic reaction upon injection. Once the patient reacted, the subsequent maintenance injection regimen would be 1 or 2 doses lower (eg, 0.5 mL instead of 0.7 mL of the concentrate).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 1980s, using a model of nasal provocation, the optimal target dose for ragweed allergen immunotherapy (6 to 12 mcg Amb a 1 per injection) was determined. Maintenance doses lower than this (eg, &lt;2 to 3 mcg) did not provide consistent relief of <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinitis/conjunctivitis</span> symptoms, while MTD (eg, 24 to 48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/injection)</span> carried a relatively high risk of systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/14,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provocation studies with cat room exposure provided evidence for an optimal dose of cat major allergen (Fel d 1) of approximately 10 mcg per maintenance injection in patients with asthma and allergies to cat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchial challenge studies of patients with asthma and allergy to dust mite identified a target dose of approximately 7 mcg of the major protein (Der p 1) per maintenance injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>These and subsequent studies provide the basis of the doses recommended for use in clinical practice. However, optimal doses have not been determined for many aeroallergens. Current dosing recommendations are reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

The duration of immunotherapy ranged from three days to three years, with an average number of 18 injections per subject.

In this study, SCIT was approximately equivalent in efficacy to glucocorticoid nasal sprays. It is probable that the two therapies together are additive and that the combination of a glucocorticoid nasal spray and SCIT represents the most effective medical management of allergic rhinitis available, although SCIT has not been compared with other therapies in head-to-head trials.</p><p>Most studies of the effect of immunotherapy on allergic conjunctivitis were performed in patients with concomitant rhinitis. However, one review examined the effects of SCIT on ocular allergy by analyzing 15 studies of varying rigor that documented ocular symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Asthma triggers vary significantly among individuals, and allergen exposure may be just one of several triggers that are important for a given patient. Thus, patients for whom allergen exposure is clearly an important trigger are more likely to experience meaningful benefit. In contrast, SCIT might not produce clinically meaningful improvement in a patient whose asthma is largely triggered by viral illnesses or irritant exposure (eg, tobacco smoke), even if they are sensitized to several allergens.</p><p>Another important factor may be the duration of allergic disease.

Long-term, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of SCIT are difficult to perform because of the prolonged time periods and significant patient effort involved.

The analysis also examined the longer-term risk of asthma development, as well as the ability of immunotherapy to prevent the occurrence of a first allergic disease in sensitized but asymptomatic individuals or to prevent sensitization to new allergens. For these outcome measures, there were consistent trends toward benefit, although the findings were not conclusive (confidence intervals included no effect).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL PATIENT GROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of SCIT in certain patient groups warrants special consideration, including individuals with more severe asthma, those requiring beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, patients with autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency, and pregnant women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe or unstable asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of SCIT may impart unacceptable risk for patients with severe or unstable asthma, because these individuals are at greater risk for systemic allergic reactions involving severe bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. This includes patients who require chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy or have had severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization or intubation in the previous six months. The World Health Organization (WHO) task force on immunotherapy recommended that SCIT <strong>not</strong> be administered to patients with asthma who have a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &lt;75 percent and that all patients with asthma on SCIT be carefully monitored.

Patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are theoretically at increased risk during anaphylaxis, possibly due to the inhibition of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in poorer response to hemodynamic stress during hypotension or to accumulated bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. The data behind these conclusions are presented elsewhere.

Most clinicians avoid administering SCIT to patients on significant doses of beta-blockers. In some cases, hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders can be treated with medications that do not carry these risks. A European guideline considers beta-blocker use to be relatively contraindicated in aeroallergen SCIT, although not with venom immunotherapy in patients with clear indications for both interventions, since venom immunotherapy is considered potentially lifesaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Unlike immunotherapy for venom allergy, immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis or asthma is generally considered elective. The use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in patients receiving venom immunotherapy is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Immunotherapy does not activate complement or anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a). Unfortunately, there are no substantive data examining the issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. One European guideline considers autoimmune disease that is active (ie, not responding to therapy) to be an absolute contraindication, while stable, controlled autoimmune disease is a relative contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In addition, sublingual immunotherapy offers an easier route of administration. For these reasons, most guidelines consider age under five years to be a relative contraindication SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/60,64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,64-66</a>]. However, by school age, most children are mature enough to cooperate with immunotherapy and can understand the benefits. Data about safety and efficacy in young children are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], although in the small number of studies of immunotherapy in young children (usually given for Hymenoptera venom allergy), therapy was usually well-tolerated and beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. There is also evidence that immunotherapy administered to children with allergic rhinitis can prevent the progression to allergic asthma. Thus, for older children with allergic rhinitis that requires chronic pharmacotherapy, SCIT becomes a more attractive treatment option, especially for those with a strong family history of asthma. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Preventive effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no strict upper limit to the age at which immunotherapy can be beneficial. Several placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated efficacy have included subjects up to 60 years of age. A specific study in patients aged 54 and older found efficacy in rhinitis and asthma due to ragweed and birch pollens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, the presence of comorbid cardiac or pulmonary conditions might increase the risk of a poor outcome following a systemic reaction. In addition, duration of disease is also important, especially in the treatment of allergic asthma.

The cost of SCIT is obviously dependent upon the care delivery structure in which it is administered. However, statistically significant health care cost benefits were demonstrated in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis within three months of initiating SCIT in one American study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14773138\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional SCIT requires multiple, regularly scheduled visits to a health care provider. In the United States, it is common practice to administer one or two sets of injections each week, beginning with low doses and gradually increasing to the effective therapeutic range for each allergen. Effective doses are typically reached within three to six months, after which visits are needed every two to four weeks for the remainder of treatment period.</p><p>Clinicians or staff should discuss the time commitment required with <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/caregivers</span> in detail when planning to begin SCIT, since adherence to the treatment schedule is necessary to obtain maximal benefit. It is also helpful to schedule regular follow-up visits, especially during the first year of immunotherapy, to review the patients' progress and address adherence issues that may arise. Patients who frequently miss injections will have trouble advancing to the higher doses that confer most of the clinical effect. On the other hand, perfect compliance may not be essential for a good clinical outcome, as demonstrated in a study of over 3000 low-income children with asthma who were treated with immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Despite the fact that only 16 percent completed the recommended three years of treatment, resource use and cost of care for this group were significantly decreased compared with pretreatment levels.</p><p>Accelerated (ie, cluster and rush) schedules of SCIT have been developed, which allow patients to reach effective therapeutic doses within a few weeks or days. Rates of adverse allergic reactions are generally higher with the most accelerated protocols, although many patients tolerate cluster schedules well and prefer the greater convenience.
