There are three critical anatomic points of narrowing: the cricopharyngeus muscle, the broncho-aortic constriction, and the esophagogastric junction, which are also the most common sites of iatrogenic and mechanical perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54206 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75732 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The arterial supply includes the inferior thyroid artery (cervical esophagus), bronchial arteries and the aorta (thoracic esophagus), and branches of the left gastric artery and inferior phrenic artery (abdominal esophagus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83473 \">figure 9</a>). The venous drainage is through the inferior thyroid vein (cervical esophagus); the azygous vein, the hemiazygous vein, or the bronchial veins (thoracic esophagus); and the coronary vein (abdominal esophagus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83472 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p>The esophagus has a rich network of lymphatic channels in the submucosa that can facilitate the longitudinal spread of neoplastic cells along the esophageal wall.

An important point is that the regional lymph nodes for all locations in the esophagus, including the cervical esophagus and esophagogastric junction, extend from the periesophageal cervical nodes to celiac nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111319\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111319 \">figure 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7375097\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common histologic types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenters located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ. Thus, regardless of histology and Siewert type, esophageal tumors arising in the cervical, thoracic esophagus or abdominal esophagus, and those involving the EGJ that have an epicenter within 2 cm of the EGJ, share the same criteria for T stage, N stage, and M stage designation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The TNM and Siewert (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101001 \">figure 13</a>) classifications are reviewed elsewhere.

However, surgical resection is generally recommended, particularly for patients with adenocarcinoma, because of the higher local control rates and lesser need for palliative procedures when surgery is a component of therapy. If there was a complete pathologic response to chemoradiation then it might be reasonable to avoid surgery but since this only occurs in 20 to 25 percent of cases, and it is not possible to reliably identify these patients either by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or repeat PET scan, then the recommendation is to proceed with resection if the patient is fit for surgery and has not progressed during chemoradiotherapy.

Neither neoadjuvant chemotherapy nor chemoradiotherapy increased the risk of total postoperative mortality or morbidity. However, subgroup analysis suggested that patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell cancer might be at an elevated risk for postoperative mortality relative to those treated by surgery alone (risk ratio 1.95, 95% CI 1.06-3.6). </p><p>Issues related to post-chemoradiotherapy surgery in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal cancer are addressed elsewhere.

This one-stage, three-phase operation requires cervical, abdominal, and thoracic incisions, and a permanent terminal tracheostomy. In addition, bilateral radical neck dissections are generally performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/19-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-29</a>].

For tumors confined to the proximal portion of the cervical esophagus, with a sufficient distal resection margin, a free jejunal interposition graft, or a deltopectoral or pectoralis major myocutaneous flap are alternative reconstructive options. Free jejunal grafts are advantageous because this approach avoids mediastinal dissection, although expertise in performing microvascular anastomosis is required. Graft necrosis, fistula formation, and later graft strictures are specific problems. When compared with gastric pull-up procedures, graft survival and leakage rates are similar.

In selected cases, such as a superficial or early invasive esophageal cancer arising distally in the setting of Barrett's esophagus, a more limited resection (eg, an anastomosis in the thorax or a less radical resection such as a transhiatal resection) can be performed. However, the optimal surgical approach in these clinical settings is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].

These conduits are resistant to the effects of gastric acid, and they have a shape similar to the native esophagus.

The minimum number of lymph nodes that should be removed during potentially curative esophagectomy has not been established. However, as many lymph nodes should be removed as is feasible, since more extensive lymphadenectomy has been associated with better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/42,119-122\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,119-122</a>]. For example, in a retrospective review of 972 patients with node negative esophageal cancer, the five-year disease-specific survival was 55 percent when less than 11 nodes were resected, 66 percent for 11 to 17 nodes resected, and 75 percent for 18 or more nodes resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. The data suggest that the higher number of nodes retrieved correspond to a more extensive resection.</p><p>Many high-volume surgical centers routinely perform en-bloc esophagectomy with a two-field (mediastinal, upper abdomen) lymph node dissection in the belief that this contributes to better locoregional control because of removal of metastatic lymph nodes. An even more extensive lymphadenectomy, three-field lymphadenectomy of the mediastinal, abdominal and cervical nodes, is commonly practiced in Asian countries for upper thoracic esophageal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/36-42,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42,123</a>]. In a retrospective review of 1361 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus, the frequency of nodal metastasis was neck (9.8 percent), upper mediastinum (18.0 percent), middle mediastinum (18.9 percent), lower mediastinum (11.8 percent), and upper abdomen (28.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

As an example, in one American series of 80 patients undergoing this technique in conjunction with en bloc esophagectomy, the overall five-year survival rate was 51 percent (88 percent for node-negative and 33 percent for node-positive patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

In the US, en-bloc resection of the mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes is considered a standard component of transthoracic esophagectomy, and a three-field lymphadenectomy is not considered a standard treatment for patients with esophageal cancer.

In a randomized trial of 83 patients undergoing an esophagogastric anastomosis, the additional 5 cm esophageal resection to permit a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis did not increase tumor removal and survival or adversely influence morbidity, anastomotic diameter, or body weight development compared with a thoracic esophagogastric anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. </p><p>At present, the choice of anastomotic location remains clinician dependent.

However, the anatomic confines of the neck and thoracic inlet limit surrounding tissue contamination and, thus, limit morbidity. A systematic review of four clinical trials that included 267 patients found that patients undergoing a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis (n = 132) had a higher rate of anastomotic leak compared with those undergoing a thoracic esophagogastric anastomosis (18 versus 4 percent, odds ratio [OR] 3.43, 95% CI 1.09-10.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. A cervical esophagogastric anastomosis has a significantly higher rate of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (OR 7.14, 1.75-29.14), but there was no difference in rate of pulmonary complications, perioperative mortality, benign stricture formation, or tumor recurrence at the anastomotic site.
