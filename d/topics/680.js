The disorder is predominantly unilateral, though rarely both eyes may be affected. It is often associated with impaired or absent stereoacuity (fine depth perception) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Unilateral amblyopia is defined as &ge;2-line difference in visual acuity between eyes, and bilateral amblyopia (also known as ametropic or isoametropic amblyopia) is defined as visual acuity worse than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> in either eye (in children &ge;4 years) or visual acuity worse than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/50</span> in either eye (in children &le;3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These definitions, however, have certain limitations. Most notably, it is important to recognize that measuring visual acuity in young children by traditional methods is usually not possible. Estimation of visual acuity in young children and diagnosis of amblyopia require a complete eye examination by a skilled eye care specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3240578\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amblyopia results from disturbances in visual development early in life. The period of visual cortex neuroplasticity is the critical period during which the visual system is affected by outside influences. Appropriately focused visual stimuli are crucial to the development of normal vision. Visual acuity typically reaches the adult level by three to five years of age. The period during which visual deprivation may cause amblyopia extends for a longer period of time, from a few months of age to approximately seven to eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Visual development'</a>.)</p><p>Amblyopia is classified by the underlying cause of the visual disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3058888\"><span class=\"h2\">Strabismic amblyopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strabismus is the misalignment of the eyes. Strabismic amblyopia results from the abnormal binocular interaction that is present with strabismus. This abnormal interaction occurs because the foveas of the two eyes are presented with two different and unfusable images. The visual cortex suppresses the image from one eye in order to avoid having diplopia; long-term suppression of one eye results in strabismic amblyopia.</p><p>Amblyopia does not develop in all children with strabismus. In children with intermittent strabismus (eg, intermittent exotropia), the images presented to the foveas can be fused a large proportion of the time, which prevents the development of amblyopia in most children. In children with constant strabismus, alternate fixation (ie, sometimes with the right eye and sometimes with the left) may also prevent the development of amblyopia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of strabismus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3240669\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractive amblyopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refractive amblyopia most commonly occurs as a result of asymmetric refractive error (anisometropia). In anisometropic amblyopia, the foveas of the two eyes are presented with different image clarity due to unequal uncorrected refractive errors; the image in one eye is not focused on the fovea at the same time as the other eye. Bilateral refractive amblyopia (called ametropic or isoametropic amblyopia) is less common and develops when is severe uncorrected refractive error.</p><p>Refractive amblyopia occurs most commonly in hyperopic patients, but it may occur in patients with severe myopia or astigmatism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractive-errors-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractive errors in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Refractive amblyopia is often detected at an older age than strabismic amblyopia, because children with refractive amblyopia lack obvious external abnormalities of the eyes and their visual functioning appears normal because they typically see well with the fellow eye. Affected children are often diagnosed at the first vision screening when they are old enough to identify letters or figures (typically four to five years). Photoscreening, which is a reliable method to perform vision screening in younger nonverbal or preliterate children, may lead to earlier detection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children#H3092026\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Instrument-based screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3240702\"><span class=\"h2\">Deprivational amblyopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deprivation amblyopia is the least common and most severe type of amblyopia. It results from vision deprivation, typically a result of interruption of the visual axis or severe distortion of the foveal image. Congenital cataracts, ptosis, congenital corneal opacities, vitreous hemorrhage, and severe refractive errors may cause deprivation amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Deprivation amblyopia in infancy results in permanent visual impairment if it is not treated urgently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in children&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of amblyopia is estimated to be between 1 and 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/5,11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11-18</a>].

In a series of 961 children, the mean ages of presentation for strabismic, refractive, and combined amblyopia were 3.3, 5.6, and 4.4 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The reported upper age limit at which amblyopia may develop after exposure to an amblyopia-inducing condition (eg, traumatic cataract) is approximately six to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>].</p><p>The following factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small size for gestational age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relative with amblyopia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodevelopmental delay</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3241778\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In accord with the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and US Preventive Services Task Force, we recommend screening to detect amblyopia in all children younger than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Observational studies have shown that screening and early treatment of amblyopia and amblyogenic risk factors in young children is associated with reductions in the prevalence and severity of amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amblyopia should be suspected if the vision in the two eyes is unequal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The testing used to diagnose amblyopia depends upon the age of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104862 \">table 1B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Preverbal children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Equality of vision between the eyes in preverbal children is assessed with several simple tests, which can be performed in the primary care office setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fixation reflex</strong> &ndash; Testing of the fixation reflex involves moving a visual target to and fro in the child's visual space. Each eye is tested separately by occluding the fellow eye. Accuracy is improved if the fixation test is repeated several times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Fixation reflex'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children who have strabismus and equal vision can maintain steady fixation with either eye and typically do not have a strong fixation preference for one eye. Conversely, children with strabismus and amblyopia will rarely maintain fixation with the amblyopic eye when both eyes are uncovered. Detection of unequal vision is more difficult in nonverbal children who do not have strabismus, but the following tests are helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Objection to occlusion</strong> &ndash; The occlusion objection test involves monitoring the child's response to alternate occlusion of the eyes. Children with equal vision should respond equally, or not at all, to occlusion of either eye. Children with moderate-to-severe visual impairment in one eye typically become irritable when the eye with better vision is occluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52824 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The test should be repeated several times because some children become agitated and resist attempts to cover either eye. A strong preference for one eye, indicated by objecting to its occlusion, is highly suggestive of amblyopia in the opposite eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertical prism test</strong> &ndash; The vertical prism test uses a 10- to 14-prism-diopter vertical prism to induce a vertical tropia that facilitates the detection of unequal vision in preliterate children without strabismus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The test is performed by first holding the prism (with the base down) in front of the child's right eye, which causes the image viewed by this eye to be higher than that of the left eye and resulting in a functional vertical tropia. Amblyopia should be suspected if the eyes move upward consistently to view the displaced image. This signifies that the patient prefers (ie, has better vision) in the right eye. The test then is repeated with the prism in front of the left eye to confirm this result. If, when the base down prism is placed before the left eye there is no upward movement of the eyes, then this signifies that the patient prefers using the right eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vision is thought to be equal if the child is able to maintain fixation with either eye and shows no preference for one displaced image over the other. Although the test is simple to perform in any setting, pediatric health care providers rarely perform the vertical prism test because they lack the necessary equipment. In addition, studies have shown that the results of fixation preference testing do not always correlate with formal visual acuity testing results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Children &gt;3 years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate assessment of visual acuity can be made in cooperative verbal children. Visual acuity testing with optotypes should be attempted in all children older than three years. In the absence of an anatomic abnormality of the eyes, a best corrected visual acuity difference of two or more lines between the eyes (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">20/20</span> in the left eye and <span class=\"nowrap\">20/30</span> in the right eye) indicates the presence of amblyopia in the poorer performing eye. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Optotype tests'</a>.)</p><p>Allen figure cards and other picture optotype tests typically are used to test the vision of younger children or children who are unable to cooperate with testing using the Snellen chart or the tumbling E figures. Allen figures frequently overestimate visual acuity in children with amblyopia. For this reason, Allen cards should be used only when other testing measures are not possible and should be used in conjunction with the vertical prism test. Amblyopia should be suspected when an acuity difference of one line between the eyes is found when Allen cards are used (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">20/30</span> in the left eye and <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> in the right).</p><p>Using a row of targets rather than a single optotype provides a more accurate assessment of visual acuity and improves detection of amblyopia. The &quot;crowding phenomenon&quot; refers to achievement of better visual acuity when optotypes are presented in isolation than when they are presented in a row or with surrounding crowding bars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60600 \">figure 1</a>). Crowding has minimal effect on visual acuity in a normally sighted eye; however, it may create substantial disturbance for the amblyopic eye resulting in lower visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Screening includes vision risk assessment at all health maintenance visits and vision screening at three, four, and five years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62277%7EPEDS%2F104862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62277 graphicRef104862 \">table 1A-B</a>). Early detection and treatment of amblyopia improves the prognosis for normal eye development.

The testing used to diagnose amblyopia depends upon the age of the child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104862 \">table 1B</a>). In preverbal children, asymmetry of vision may be indicated by an abnormal fixation reflex or occlusion objection test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52824 \">picture 1</a>).
