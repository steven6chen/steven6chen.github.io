Some propose that atypical refers to the intrinsic resistance of these organisms to penicillin, the antibiotic typically used to treat pneumonia in the past. Others suggest that atypical refers to the mild nature of the pneumonia caused by many of these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking pneumonia is a colloquial term that refers to a mild pneumonia caused by any organism that does not require bed rest or hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1280373340\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rates of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> in adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) vary among studies, ranging from &lt;1 to 20 percent of cases in which a pathogen was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/2-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-13</a>]. The wide range in reported prevalence is likely due to variability in diagnostic methods used and potential cyclic patterns of illness or clustering of cases. Without a reliable reference standard for diagnosis, prevalence cannot be precisely or accurately determined. Rates of infection appear to be higher in patients with mild infection seen in the ambulatory setting and decline in patients with increasing disease severity, including hospitalized patients and those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/5,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,9</a>].</p><p>The overall seroprevalence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> is about 50 to 85 percent across continents, suggesting that infection is often asymptomatic and that <em>C. pneumoniae </em>is a ubiquitous organism found worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Seroprevalence appears to increase with age, with antibodies detectable in &lt;10 percent of children under 10 years old, 30 to 40 percent of teenagers, and 50 percent of middle-aged adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Seroprevalence may be overestimated because the serologic assays used for the detection of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> can cross react with other <em>Chlamydia </em>species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p><em>C. pneumoniae </em>is transmitted from person to person, likely via respiratory droplets, small particle aerosolization, and fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Outbreaks of <em>C. pneumoniae </em>infections have been reported in persons living in close quarters, including residents of long-term care facilities, prisoners, and military personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-30</a>].

Upon further analysis, reclassification was not deemed necessary by the scientific community, and it was agreed that the Chlamydiaceae family contains a single genus, <em>Chlamydia </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2081942577\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. pneumoniae </em>is an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacilli. It is one of the smallest prokaryotes, with a genome size of about 1.2 million nucleotides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p><em>Chlamydia</em> species share several structural and metabolic features that differentiate them from other bacteria. The cell wall of <em>Chlamydia</em> spp contains an inner and outer membrane as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), similar to all gram-negative bacteria. However, the chlamydial LPS variant is less endotoxic than in many gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. <em>Chlamydia</em> spp have very little peptidoglycan between the inner and outer membranes and thus have limited susceptibility to penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,40</a>].</p><p>Metabolically, <em>Chlamydia </em>species rely on the host cell for host adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for protein synthesis, making replication outside the host cell non-sustainable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,39</a>]. Among <em>Chlamydia </em>species<em>, C. pneumoniae</em> specifically lacks a tryptophan recovery or biosynthesis pathway, rendering the organism vulnerable to host interferon-gamma mediated immune control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] as well as intrinsically resistant to sulfonamides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>One of the most unique features of <em>Chlamydia</em> species is that bacterial growth requires a biphasic developmental cycle, with two morphologically distinct infectious and reproductive forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,39,42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elementary body (EB) &ndash; The extracellular, metabolically inactive, spore-like infectious form, which is able to survive outside the host cell</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reticulate body (RB) &ndash; The intracellular, metabolically active but noninfectious form, which is able to rely on the host cell for replication</p><p/><p>Aberrant bodies, variants of RBs that are less metabolically active and less infectious than RBs, have been observed in in vitro<em> </em>systems designed to induce persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Outside the host, the organism exists as a small, dense elementary body (EB). The EB has a rigid wall, resulting from disulfide cross-linking of envelope proteins, allowing it to survive outside the host for a short amount of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Upon infection, the EB attaches to respiratory mucosal epithelial cells and enters the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis, the EB persists within the phagosome and differentiates into a metabolically active reticulate body (RB). The RB replicates within the host cell forming microcolonies, or intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of hundreds of bacteria, within 36 to 72 hours. The RBs reorganize into the smaller, denser EBs, which are released either via cell lysis or exocytosis. The EBs can then go on to infect new cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,39</a>].</p><p>During replication, chlamydial antigens are released onto the host cell surface, inducing the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One critical feature of <em>Chlamydia</em> organisms is that immunity to infection is not long lived. As a result, reinfection is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,39</a>]. In vitro data suggest that Chlamydiae can also cause persistent infection. While persistent infection has not been definitively demonstrated in humans, it is hypothesized to play a role in multiple chronic illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/20,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,42</a>].

Pneumonia due to <em>C. pneumoniae</em> is typically mild; however, severe cases, cases complicated by pleural effusion and empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], intensive care unit admission, and death have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/6,30,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,44,45</a>].</p><p>Although there are no clinical features that clearly distinguish pneumonia caused by <em>C. pneumoniae </em>from pneumonia due to other causes, small case series suggest that upper respiratory involvement such as pharyngitis, laryngitis, and sinusitis may occur more frequently with <em>C. pneumoniae</em> and that a gradual onset of illness is common<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/30,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,45-47</a>]. A biphasic pattern of illness has also been reported, with upper respiratory tract symptoms preceding the onset of pneumonia by 2 to 6 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>White blood cell counts are typically normal or mildly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/11,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,48</a>]. Chest radiograph findings are usually nonspecific. The most commonly reported findings are unilateral alveolar opacities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]; lobar opacification is reported to be less common than with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]<em>.</em></p><p>The overall spectrum of illness associated with <em>C. pneumoniae </em>is wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening disease. The majority of infections are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Other reported manifestations include pharyngitis, laryngitis, otitis media, and bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/30,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,51</a>]. Reports of acute infections outside the respiratory tract are rare but exist, including meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>], Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>], and endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Pneumonia caused by <em>C. pneumoniae</em> is typically community acquired and mild. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> in adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) vary among studies, ranging from &lt;1 to 20 percent of cases in which a pathogen was identified. The incidence appears to be higher in patients with mild infection seen in the ambulatory setting and declines in patients with increasing disease severity, including hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care units. (See <a href=\"#H1280373340\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia caused by <em>C. pneumoniae</em> presents similarly to other forms of CAP and is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath. No clinical features clearly distinguish pneumonia caused by <em>C. pneumoniae </em>from pneumonia due to other causes, although a gradual or biphasic onset of illness and concurrent pharyngitis, laryngitis, or sinusitis may be more common with <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with CAP, pursuing a microbiologic diagnosis of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> is not necessary, as results would not change management. We generally pursue microbiologic testing when an atypical infection is suspected and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay is available. (See <a href=\"#H857159944\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When microbiologic confirmation is desired, we use a PCR-based assay. PCR can be performed on most specimen types, including nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The performance of PCR-based assays for the diagnosis of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection has not been validated in clinical settings; clinical judgement should be used in interpreting results. (See <a href=\"#H2030142524\" class=\"local\">'Microbiologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with CAP, the etiology is not known at the time of diagnosis, and empiric treatment for CAP is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F111829\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111829 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F112543\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112543 \">algorithm 2</a>).
