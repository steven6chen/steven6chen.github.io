Arachidonic acid is derived from cell membrane phospholipids. Leukotrienes possess diverse biological actions and are increasingly implicated in a variety of disease states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the role of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma, and agents with the capacity to inhibit the synthesis or action of leukotrienes are used in the treatment of asthma.</p><p>The use of antileukotriene agents in the management of asthma will be reviewed here. An overview of asthma management and the integrated use of asthma therapies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LEUKOTRIENE SYNTHESIS AND BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukotrienes are synthesized by various leukocytes in response to activation by stimuli such as antigen, microbes, cross-liked immunoglobulin E, complement, osmotic challenge, and certain cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Upon activation, intracellular calcium concentrations rise, causing the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to translocate from soluble cytosolic or intranuclear pools to the perinuclear membrane. Here, it associates with the helper protein, 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75064 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>FLAP is thought to &quot;present&quot; substrate arachidonate derived from membrane phospholipids to 5-LO, permitting it to catalyze the formation of an unstable intermediate known as leukotriene A4 (LTA4). This intermediate can then be transformed into two different classes of leukotrienes: cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cysteinyl leukotrienes</strong> &ndash; The CysLTs include leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and its derivatives, LTD4 and LTE4. CysLTs are the predominant class of leukotrienes synthesized by eosinophils and mast cells, two cell types that are prominent in asthmatic inflammation. CysLTs are also produced by basophils and macrophages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LTA4 is converted to LTC4 by LTC4 synthase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75064 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and exported to the extracellular microenvironment through the action of a specific membrane transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Once in the extracellular microenvironment, LTC4 is rapidly converted to LTD4 and then LTE4 by sequential removal of the glutamic acid and then the glycine residues. Sometimes, LTA4 that is produced by mast cells or eosinophils is taken up by neutrophils or endothelial cells and converted to LTC4 and its metabolites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CysLTs and their metabolites can be measured in various biological fluids, including plasma, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, and exhaled breath condensate. However, these assays have a number of limitations and are rarely performed outside of investigational settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Measurement of leukotrienes is complicated by their inherent instability and the fact that synthesis may occur in brief bursts. Thus, their detection following synthesis may be limited to specific windows of time. One means of assessing leukotriene production is the measurement of urinary levels of the terminal metabolite, LTE4, which reflects total body CysLT production over the interval since the bladder was last emptied. The sensitivity of this approach is limited, though, as only a small percentage of exogenously administered CysLT can be recovered in the urine as LTE4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dihydroxy leukotrienes</strong> &ndash; LTB4 is the only known member of a second class of leukotrienes, the dihydroxy leukotrienes. LTB4 arises from the hydrolysis of LTA4 by LTA4 hydrolase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75064 \">figure 1</a>). It is the major leukotriene product of neutrophils and is also synthesized by macrophages and dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Once formed, LTB4 is actively transported out of the source cell. LTB4 exerts its effects (eg, leukocyte recruitment and activation) via B leukotriene receptors 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variations in leukotriene synthesis</strong> &ndash; Output of the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway may be influenced by both genetic and acquired factors. Enzyme deficiencies are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, various polymorphisms have been identified in either the coding or the promoter regions of 5-LO, FLAP, LTA4 hydrolase, and LTC4 synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Such polymorphisms have been associated in some studies with aspirin-induced asthma or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other factors, such as numerous cytokines, endotoxin, and the adipokine leptin, can result in variations in leukotriene synthesis by modulating the expression or activity of leukotriene-forming enzymes. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leukotriene receptors</strong> &ndash; Leukotrienes act by binding to seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors, which are found on multiple cell types, including inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils, as well as structural cells such as glandular epithelium, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Receptors for CysLTs</strong> &ndash; The CysLTs bind to the cognate receptors CysLT1 and CysLT2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75064 \">figure 1</a>). The actions of the CysLTs upon binding to CysLT1, in particular, are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The CysLT1 receptor mediates pro-asthmatic actions such as sustained bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and edema. The order of potency for CysLT binding at CysLT1 is LTD4&gt;LTC4&gt;&gt;LTE4. Examples of selective CysLT1 antagonists include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zafirlukast</a>, and pranlukast. (See <a href=\"#H2046020118\" class=\"local\">'Available antileukotriene agents'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">As with the leukotriene-forming enzymes, the CysLT receptors are also subject to regulation. As an example, CysLT1 receptors in nasal inflammatory leukocytes are increased in aspirin-sensitive patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (with and without nasal polyposis) compared with non-aspirin-sensitive asthmatics and are down-regulated after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The CysLT2 receptor does not have a known role in bronchoconstriction, although it may contribute to inflammation and edema formation by its actions on leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], respectively. No selective antagonists are currently available for CysLT2. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">It has long been known that neither CysLT1 nor CysLT2 has much affinity for LTE4, the final metabolite of all CysLTs. Yet, this stable metabolite is present in biological samples at high concentrations, and inhaled LTE4 has both proinflammatory and bronchoconstrictor activity, raising the possibility of an additional LTE4 receptor. In mouse models, the purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub> is necessary for LTE4 to promote eosinophilic inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An orphan receptor termed GPR99 has been proposed as a CysLT3 receptor with selectivity for LTE4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In mouse models, iGPR99 is important in mediating effects of LTE4 to increase airway goblet cell numbers and mucin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in human mast cell lines, LTE4 is able to signal via CysLT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A separate report similarly showed that LTE4 could activate human type 2 innate lymphoid cells via CysLT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These studies suggest the possibility that LTE4 can signal through CysLT1 despite limited demonstrable binding. This would call into question the importance of a unique LTE4 receptor not targeted by CysLT1 antagonists (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, pranlukast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zafirlukast</a>). If, on the other hand, these or other putative LTE4 receptors, which are not targeted by CysLT1 antagonists, prove to be relevant in humans, they will likely become a target for novel drug development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Receptors for LTB4</strong> &ndash; LTB4 binds to BLT1 and BLT2 receptors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75064 \">figure 1</a>). The biological effects of LTB4 are largely mediated by BLT1, a receptor that is upregulated differentially in response to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Binding of LTB4 to BLT1 results in recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils. BLT1 has also been implicated in recruitment of mast cell progenitors, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and CD8+ T-cells that express BLT1 have been identified in the BAL of asthmatic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Animal models have implicated the <span class=\"nowrap\">LTB4/BLT1</span> pathway in the development of allergic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">BLT2 binds LTB4 with lower affinity and also binds other lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products. Its role in the asthmatic response is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LEUKOTRIENES IN ASTHMA PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence suggest that cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of asthma. CysLTs are best known for their ability to induce smooth muscle contraction and protracted bronchoconstriction. This effect led to an early description of CysLTs as the &quot;slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As mentioned previously, the role of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in asthma is less well understood but appears to be less central.</p><p>An important characteristic of CysLT synthesis is its rapidity: Resident leukocytes can synthesize CysLTs within minutes. Moreover, subsequent waves of CysLT generation can occur as leukocytes are recruited during a late-phase response and as proinflammatory cytokines further upregulate expression of enzymes involved in their synthesis and that of their cognate receptors.</p><p>CysLTs can induce many of the abnormalities seen in both acute and chronic asthma. Actions of CysLTs include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of smooth muscle contraction and protracted bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of bronchovascular leakage and mucous gland secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of leukocyte infiltration, indirectly by inducing endothelial adhesion molecule expression and directly via chemotaxis, and stimulation of these cells to produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts to proliferate, suggesting a possible role in airway remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]</p><p/><p>Asthmatics, as a group, produce higher levels of CysLTs than non-asthmatics at baseline. Levels of sputum CysLTs correlate with asthma severity in adults, and the daily levels of urinary LTE4 are inversely associated with pulmonary function in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma tend to have the highest levels of CysLT overproduction based on exhaled breath condensates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Leukotriene levels in urine and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from subjects with asthma increase further during exercise or challenge with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or allergen in those specifically sensitive to these triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Elevated levels of urinary CysLT metabolites were detectable in over two-thirds of patients presenting for the emergency treatment of asthma exacerbations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68872\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68872 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Role of LTB4</strong> &ndash; The role of LTB4 in inflammation is different from that of the CysLTs; LTB4 is not known to participate in bronchospasm. Its best described role is that of a leukocyte chemoattractant, and it may be relevant to asthma pathogenesis through recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cell precursors, and CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Severe asthma is more likely to be characterized by neutrophilic inflammation that is relatively refractory to glucocorticoids. The contribution of LTB4 in this specific phenotype has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antileukotriene-agents-in-the-management-of-asthma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
