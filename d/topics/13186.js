Failure to respond to a recommended ART regimen is almost always a result of suboptimal adherence or viral resistance.</p><p>This topic will address laboratory monitoring during ART. Discussions related to the initiation and modification of ART are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At each visit, patients should be interviewed regarding medication adherence in a nonjudgmental manner. Optimal adherence (ie, taking all medication doses at the time intervals prescribed) to an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is important to help patients achieve and maintain virologic suppression. Adherence can vary over time and can be impacted by factors such as depression and substance use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Strict adherence is most important when patients are initiating or changing an ART regimen.</p><p>To enhance adherence, patients should understand the link between adherence and drug resistance. In addition, it is useful to discuss medication schedules with patients to help them link pill-taking behaviors to other daily activities (eg, brushing teeth). If the patient admits to difficulties with adherence, potential barriers could involve the number and timing of doses, sizes of pills, food restrictions, and treatment-limiting side effects. The patient should also be advised to notify the provider if there is an anticipated problem with adherence, such as elective surgery, or a prolonged intercurrent illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adherence can be difficult to assess. As an example, one study demonstrated that clinicians incorrectly predicted adherence in 41 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, patients often exaggerate adherence to their provider. Pharmacy records are useful to help track compliance when refills are obtained from a single pharmacy source. Clinical trials have tried to assess whether directly observed therapy may improve virologic suppression rates. One meta-analysis of 12 studies suggested that such therapy seemed to offer no benefit over self-administered treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, directly observed therapy may be beneficial in patient subgroups that are at high risk for nonadherence, such as those who are homeless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other adherence interventions (eg, assessing serum drug concentrations, monitoring pill counts, or use of electronic drug monitoring devices) are not routinely recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>For patients who have achieved sustained viral suppression, current antiretroviral medications are less affected by changes in adherence than treatments used in the early years of combination ART. Present therapies are more potent, have a higher genetic barrier to resistance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a long serum half-life. These advantages have allowed less stringent adherence with a lower risk of clinical consequences compared with some early antiretroviral medications. Despite this, patients should inform providers if doses are missed for more than a few days (eg, patient forgot to take pills on vacation) so that viral load testing can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2313558\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication persistence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication persistence is defined as the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy. Whereas adherence measures &quot;how often&quot; patients take their medications, persistence measures &quot;for how long&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This concept of medication persistence is important since interruption of ART has significant consequences, not only in increased risk for opportunistic infections, but also for serious non-AIDS events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and transmission of HIV to others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VISIT FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are started on ART should generally have follow-up within one to two weeks to ask patients about their understanding of the regimen, adverse effects, adherence, and prevention of transmission. Once patients are clinically stable on their ART regimen, visit frequency can decrease to every three to six months.</p><p>Measurements of height and weight for calculation of body mass index are advised at clinic visits; some clinics also incorporate measurements of waist circumference to detect early changes suggestive of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL LABORATORY MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should obtain several tests upon entry to care, before initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and during ART.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H45\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary care of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for complications'</a>.). </p><p>More frequent monitoring may be indicated depending upon the specific agent(s) that are used.

If normal, they can be monitored every 3 months thereafter. Patients should also be instructed about the symptoms of clinical hepatitis, particularly if they have risk factors for hepatotoxicity, such as underlying chronic viral hepatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic monitoring is particularly important in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, which can cause bone marrow suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p/><p>If mild or moderate abnormalities are detected and persist, a change in the ART regimen may be required. As an example, patient&rsquo;s renal function should be monitored using a creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate; guideline recommendations suggest substituting an alternative agent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> if a patient has a decline in their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eg, by &gt;25 percent and to a level &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73m<sup>2</sup>) and there are no other explanations for the decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Immune activation and inflammation are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain long-term consequences of HIV infection (eg, premature aging, non-AIDS defining cancers, cardiovascular disease). Markers of immune activation and inflammation are elevated with HIV infection and reduced, but in some patients not normalized, with antiretroviral therapy. However, despite the clinical significance of these abnormalities, routine testing for these markers is not recommended in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGIC RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma HIV RNA should be measured in all patients at baseline and regularly during therapy since it is the most reliable indicator of response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is useful in predicting clinical progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-14</a>]. The goal of therapy is viral load suppression below the limits of assay detection. The two assays most commonly in use (Roche TaqMan and Abbott RealTime HIV-1) have lower limits of detection of 20 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adherent patients starting ART, the speed of the viral load decline depends primarily upon the agents used in the regimen. The most rapid declines occur with integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapies are intermediate, and protease inhibitor treatments the slowest. Despite these differences, the expectation is that the initial antiretroviral regimen will achieve at least a one-log (10-fold) decline in HIV RNA by one to two weeks, a two log (100-fold) decline by four weeks, and a viral load below the level of detection by 8 to 24 weeks, regardless of prior treatment experience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77987 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14-19</a>]. </p><p>Acute illness and vaccinations can cause a transient increase in the viral load. Because of biologic variability, sequential HIV viral load measurements must exceed a threefold change or 0.5 log10 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> to be considered significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unanticipated results should be verified with a repeat test before making changes in antiretroviral therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Virologic failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal goal of therapy is viral load suppression below the limits of assay detection. However, we consider a patient to have virologic failure if they do not achieve a viral load &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> within 24 weeks of initiating ART or if they have a sustained recurrence of viremia to &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (ie, on two consecutive measurements) after initial viral suppression. This definition is consistent with the one used by the NIH AIDS Clinical Trials Group and the Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, and is based upon the following rationale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no definitive evidence that patients with single viral loads quantified as &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> using current assays are at increased risk for virologic failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This definition eliminates most cases of transient viremia caused by release of virus without viral replication, or assay variability. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Viral blips'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>There are two main causes for virologic failure: drug resistance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subtherapeutic drug levels. The latter is almost always due to problems adhering to the drug regimen, with less common causes being drug interactions or altered pharmacology due to host factors (eg, malabsorption). Thus, clinicians should thoroughly evaluate adherence in any patient who demonstrates a suboptimal early response to ART:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be asked to describe how they are taking their ART regimen to detect errors in prescribing, dispensing, or patient comprehension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be asked how many doses they are missing in a non-judgmental manner. Patients will frequently overstate adherence and the following wording may be helpful in permitting patients to discuss adherence problems: &quot;Taking pills every day can be difficult and some patients I care for have trouble taking every dose as prescribed. How much of the prescribed medication are you taking?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacy refill records are an excellent way to monitor patient adherence. Although rare individuals may evade this monitoring strategy by refilling their medications and discarding them, most non-adherent patients irregularly or never refill their medications.</p><p/><p>Drug resistance testing should be performed in the setting of virologic failure even in patients who attest to excellent adherence. Drug resistance may be transmitted or acquired due to suboptimal treatment or inadequate adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/15,17,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,20-24</a>]. In addition, resistance mutations in patients with transmitted resistance may not be apparent with baseline testing if they are present in the minority pool. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Drug resistance testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Detailed discussions of the evaluation and management of patients with virologic failure are found elsewhere.

We do not modify antiretroviral treatment for patients who have a &quot;viral blip&quot; unless the viral load is sustained at &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Instead, if a blip is detected, we initiate a discussion with the patient regarding adherence, and repeat a viral load within four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Most viral blips are not clinically significant, and are thought to represent laboratory error or release of virions not related to active viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. However, one study reported that patients with a viral rebound between 50 and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> were at increased risk for virologic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These data suggest there is a gradient of low-level viremia which, at the higher ranges, may predict future treatment failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CD4 CELL COUNTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD4 cell counts correlate with the immune response. In patients who achieve and maintain viral suppression, immunologic improvement is progressive over many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Viral suppression is usually accompanied by an increase in CD4 count of &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> at four to eight weeks, followed by slower incremental increases of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The rate of increase in CD4 cells may be slower in older patients or in those with severe immunocompromise at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CD4 cell counts may increase even in patients who cannot maintain viral suppression. These &quot;discordant results&quot; were seen most commonly in patients with extensive drug resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) when fewer drug classes were available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Various hypotheses for this observed immunologic benefit in the face of ongoing viremia have been proposed, including decreased replication capacity of resistant strains, decreased immune activation, and preservation of non-syncytium-inducing strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, this immunologic benefit was usually lost when the HIV RNA returned to the pre-treatment baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. With the current availability of a wide range of HIV treatments with activity against resistant viruses, most patients are able to achieve virologic suppression.</p><p>In contrast, other patients may obtain viral suppression without any significant improvement in absolute CD4 cell counts. Risk factors for this outcome include advanced age and low nadir CD4 count. This observation has also been noted in patients treated with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a>, which is no longer recommended.</p><p>The CD4 count can be affected by inter-laboratory variability, acute illness, medications that suppress the bone marrow, and diurnal variation. For these reasons, results that are unexpectedly different from prior ones should be confirmed with a repeat test. A significant difference between two test results is generally defined as a 30 percent change in the absolute CD4 count or a change in CD4 cell count percent by three percentage points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The time to achieve an undetectable viral load depends on the potency of the regimen, drug resistance, and the baseline viral load. Laboratory monitoring is done more frequently after the initiation or modification of ART; the interval can then be increased when viral suppression is achieved and sustained since virologic and immunologic failure is unlikely in patients with sustained virologic suppression and immunologic recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272924539\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral load monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend HIV RNA testing two weeks after initiation of ART and then at four to eight-week intervals until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection (&lt;20 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> by most commercial assays). Patients who have a suboptimal decrease in viral load (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77987 \">table 1</a>), even after two weeks, could be confused about how to take their regimen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> be non-adherent. Thus, providers should talk with such patients to ensure they are taking their medications properly (eg, dosing, avoiding drug interactions) and counsel them on adherence. Drug resistance testing should be performed on virus from patients who have not achieved HIV RNA suppression by 24 weeks, or earlier if there is an increase from a prior value. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Virologic failure'</a> above.) </p><p>Once viral suppression is attained, HIV RNA can be monitored every three to six months.

More frequent testing should be resumed if a patient has a deterioration in their clinical status, such as an opportunistic infection, has a significant lapse in treatment for any reason, or if a patient has an undetectable viral load, but undergoes a change in regimen (eg, because of toxicity). For individuals changing their ART regimen, HIV RNA should be monitored within two to eight weeks after a change is made to be certain viral suppression has been maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H660200449\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DHHS and The International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) panels have issued guidelines for viral load monitoring.

Resistance testing should ideally be performed while the patient is taking the failing regimen, or within a few weeks of discontinuing treatment; however this might not be possible in patients who are nonadherent to their regimen. The results should be evaluated by a clinician with expertise in interpretation, and then used to guide selection of a new regimen.

In contrast, drug resistance testing may not detect all the viral mutations in patients who have virologic failure because of non-adherence, since drug-resistant virus may be out-competed by wild-type virus. This situation is most likely to occur when the patient has not taken <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> medications for more than four weeks when resistance testing is performed. However, many mutations do persist, and if found, are useful for selecting the next antiretroviral regimen.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be interviewed regarding medication adherence at each clinic visit in a nonjudgmental manner. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Adherence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are started on ART should generally have follow-up within one to two weeks to ask patients about adverse effects, adherence, and prevention of transmission. Once patients are clinically stable on their ART regimen, visit frequency can decrease to every three to six months. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Visit frequency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine laboratory monitoring includes complete blood count with differential, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, liver function tests, lipid and glucose levels, and urinalysis. Additional monitoring may be indicated depending upon the specific agent(s) that are used. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'General laboratory monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do HIV RNA testing two weeks after the initiation of ART, and then every four to eight weeks until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection (below 20 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> by most commercial assays). At that point, the viral load can be measured every three to six months to confirm ongoing viral suppression. (See <a href=\"#H272924539\" class=\"local\">'Viral load monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CD4 cell count should be obtained three months after initiating therapy, and subsequently every three to six months. (See <a href=\"#H1236958815\" class=\"local\">'CD4 cell count monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have suppressed viral loads for more than two years, viral load testing can be performed every six months and CD4 cell counts can be checked annually. If the CD4 cell count is &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> CD4 cell count monitoring is optional. However, more frequent HIV RNA monitoring should be resumed if there is a change in the patient&rsquo;s clinical status or if there is a change in regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1236958815\" class=\"local\">'CD4 cell count monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H272924539\" class=\"local\">'Viral load monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virologic failure is defined either as primary failure to achieve a viral load &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or any sustained recurrence of viremia to &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> after initial viral suppression. Virologic failure may be due to drug resistance or lack of adherence. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Virologic failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral &quot;blips&quot; refer to an isolated low-level of detectable HIV RNA, typically 50 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> that occurs during long-term monitoring of patients on ART with a suppressed viral load (ie, HIV RNA below the limits of assay detection). Isolated viral blips do not appear to represent ongoing viral replication, unless low levels of viremia are sustained. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Viral blips'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with virologic failure, HIV resistance testing should be obtained.
