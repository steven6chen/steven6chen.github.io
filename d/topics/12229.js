It is often called &quot;brittle bone disease.&quot; Severely affected patients suffer multiple fractures with minimal or no trauma, and infants with the worst form of OI die in the perinatal period. Mild forms of OI may manifest with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss.</p><p>The goals of therapy for patients with OI are to reduce fracture rates, prevent long-bone deformities and scoliosis, minimize chronic pain, and maximize mobility and other functional capabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Patients with OI should be referred for evaluation by specialists in genetics and, if clinically indicated, orthopedics with expertise in treating OI at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach and consists of physical therapy (PT), surgical interventions, medications, and, in some cases, experimental therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Patients with OI need additional health supervision from their primary care providers and monitoring for potential complications.</p><p>The management and prognosis of OI are presented here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13635515\"><span class=\"h1\">BISPHOSPHONATE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of pharmacologic fracture-prevention therapy for most forms of OI (except for type VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78737\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78737 \">table 1</a>), in which bone mineralization is defective), although none are approved specifically for use in either children or adults with OI. We suggest treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> for patients with all forms of OI, except type VI, in whom clinical benefits are likely to outweigh potential long-term risks (ie, those with long-bone deformities, vertebral compression fractures, and &ge;3 fractures per year). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5114631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Bisphosphonates are stable analogs of pyrophosphate and are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and bone turnover. They are used widely in the treatment of osteoporosis in adults and have reduced the risk of fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, men with osteoporosis, and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in multiple clinical trials.</p><p>Reports of bisphosphonates for children with OI are encouraging, with a reduced fracture frequency of up to 100 percent in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The long-term effects on structural outcomes such as scoliosis and basilar invagination are unclear. The optimal dose range, dosing interval, duration of treatment, and the long-term efficacy and safety profile of these drugs in the treatment OI have yet to be established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Further study, particularly in the form of randomized trials, is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13635530\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous pamidronate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of information about the use of bisphosphonates in OI comes from uncontrolled studies of cyclical infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> in various regimens in children with OI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These reports have noted increased bone mineral density (BMD), decreased fracture rate, and improved functional abilities, mobility, ambulation, and pain, without negative effects on fracture healing or growth rate in most studies, even when used in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8,11-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-19</a>]. A single, observational study of 14 prepubertal children with mild forms of OI (types I and IV) treated with pamidronate found a significant increase in height and sitting height standard deviation scores during the first year of treatment.</p><p>In the only controlled trial, 18 children (age range 4 to 13 years) with types III and IV OI were randomly assigned to treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day for three days every three months) or no treatment for one year. Four children in each group also received recombinant growth hormone (rGH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After one year, treated patients had significantly increased lumbar spine BMD, midvertebral height, and total vertebral area compared with controls. Upper extremity fracture rate decreased significantly in the first, but not second, year of treatment compared with the baseline rate (0.89 at baseline and 0.22 and 0.29 after one and two years of treatment, respectively). There was a trend toward decreased fracture rate in the lower extremities in the first year of treatment compared with baseline (1.44 versus 0.67, respectively). Growth rate, gross motor function, muscle strength, and pain did not change significantly in treated patients compared with controls. In the seven patients who extended treatment for an additional 6 to 21 months, bone density, midvertebral height, and vertebral area were maintained but did not increase beyond the 12-month values.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pamidronate</a> is administered intravenously in cycles of three consecutive days at two- to four-month intervals with doses ranging from 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> depending upon age, with a corresponding annual dose of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. The smallest effective dose should be used, with careful monitoring of vertebral geometry, long-bone fractures, and BMD before imitating a new cycle of treatment.</p><p>The short-term endocrine and metabolic effects of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> therapy observed in 165 children (age two weeks to 17.9 years) who received cyclic infusions included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-lived lowering of serum calcium concentrations following three sequential daily infusions (none requiring supplemental intravenous calcium)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased urinary excretion of type I collagen degradation products (N-telopeptide of type I collagen, also called amino-terminal collagen crosslinks or NTX), a marker of bone turnover</p><p/><p>Over the longer term (at least four years of therapy in 40 patients), there was no significant overall change in serum calcium concentrations from baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Mean PTH levels were elevated by 30 percent from baseline and subsequently remained stable. The excretion of NTX adjusted for urinary creatinine decreased rapidly during the first year and more slowly thereafter. After four years of bisphosphonate therapy, the adjusted urinary NTX was 63 percent lower than the baseline value and was lower than that in healthy children, indicating a sustained reduction in the rate of bone turnover that is increased in OI children.</p><p>A similar association between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> therapy and decreased bone turnover was found in a study of 29 children with OI types I, III, and IV who were treated with pamidronate for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Treatment was initiated before two years of age. Treatment with pamidronate was associated with improved bone strength and gross motor function. However, the average bone formation rate per bone surface in the treated children was 17 percent that of children with severe OI who were untreated and 25 percent that of healthy controls.</p><p>There do not appear to be any adverse short-term effects on bone quality or fracture healing despite the significant reduction in the rate of bone turnover with bisphosphonate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Iliac bone biopsy results in 45 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> for a mean of 2.4 years revealed that bone formation and bone mineralization were not impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Chronic suppression of bone turnover in children with OI does not appear to be associated with any detrimental effects on linear growth rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,25</a>]. However, it appears that most of the benefit of pamidronate therapy occurs during the first two to four years of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, it is prudent to reserve its use for patients in whom clinical benefits are likely to outweigh the long-term risks (ie, those with long-bone deformities, vertebral compression fractures, and &ge;3 fractures per year) since the long-term effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> therapy are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,10,14,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,14,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13637761\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous zoledronic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (zoledronate) requires infusion every six months, rather than every two to four months as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>. The safety and efficacy of zoledronic therapy were evaluated in a study of 17 patients with mild (type I) OI aged 1.5 to 16.8 years who were treated for one to three years. Bone density increased after two years of treatment. Two patients developed symptomatic hypocalcemia. Although the incidence of fractures in the two years preceding treatment was higher than during the first year of treatment (6.5 versus 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">fractures/year),</span> it is difficult to determine from the reported results whether the fracture rate decreased because of a short duration of follow-up and small number of fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20070471\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral risedronate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety and efficacy of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> have been evaluated in two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In the first, 53 children were randomly assigned to receive one of three doses (0.2, 1, or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week) of risedronate for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. BMD increased and long-bone bowing deformities decreased with increasing risedronate dose. The fracture rate decreased significantly in all three groups during the treatment period compared with the previous two years, but there was no difference among the groups.</p><p>In the second trial, 147 children with mostly mild phenotype were randomly assigned to receive oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> (2.5 mg if weight was 10 to 30 kg or 5 mg if weight was &gt;30 kg) or placebo for one year, followed by open-label treatment in all subjects for two additional years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were significant differences between the risedronate and placebo groups in mean lumbar spine areal BMD (16.3 versus 7.6 percent increase, respectively) and clinical nonvertebral fractures (occurred in 31 versus 49 percent, respectively). No treatment effect was observed for morphometric (radiographic) vertebral fractures after one year of treatment. Adverse events were similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to BMD or fractures during the open-label phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13635551\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral alendronate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> (5 or 10 mg based on body weight: below or above 40 kg, respectively) was studied in 139 children, aged 4 to 18 years, with severe OI in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After two years of treatment, alendronate produced a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD compared with placebo (51 versus 12 percent). However, there were no significant differences between groups with regard to growth velocity, incidence of long-bone fractures, bone pain, or pediatric disability score. The safety and tolerability of alendronate were favorable and comparable with that of placebo. Longer-term data, including bone biopsies, fracture incidence, and fracture healing, will be required to fully assess the bone safety and efficacy of alendronate in OI children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20070374\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous neridronate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of treatment with intravenous neridronate were evaluated in a trial in which 64 prepubertal Italian children (6 to 11 years) with OI were randomly assigned to treatment with neridronate (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> infused intravenously every three months) or no treatment for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], after which all patients were treated with neridronate. At the end of the first year, patients in the treatment group had greater increase in spine and hip BMD (18 to 25 percent versus 3 to 6 percent) and fewer fractures (relative risk 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.87) compared with the control group. Neridronate was well tolerated in this study. Neridronate is not available in the United States.</p><p>The efficacy of cyclical neridronate therapy in infants was evaluated in a study in which 10 infants with OI type III started cyclical neridronate just after diagnosis (at approximately one month of age) or at six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These infants were compared with historical controls matched for age, sex, and clinical severity. During the first six months, infants receiving neridronate had better growth in weight and height and fewer fractures than those waiting to start therapy or historical controls. During the second six months, infants in both of the treatment groups had fewer fractures than historical controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20070426\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral olpadronate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results similar to those with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> were reported with oral olpadronate in three boys with severe OI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a trial in which 34 children with OI were randomly assigned to olpadronate (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> or placebo, active treatment for two years was associated with a reduced risk of long-bone fractures (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

We give the following suggestions, keeping in mind that these are individualized based upon a number of factors including age of the patient, disease severity, previous treatment, and response to therapy. In principle, pretreatment evaluation and monitoring of bisphosphonate treatment in children with OI is similar to that in adults with osteoporosis.</p><p>Calcium and vitamin D intake are based upon the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for a child's age (700 to 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for calcium and 400 to 600 int. units for vitamin D). The child should be supplemented before bisphosphonate treatment is initiated if dietary intake is inadequate. Indices of calcium homeostasis (eg, calcium, phosphorous, PTH) and renal function should be assessed before initiation of treatment and followed every 6 to 12 months. Calcium levels should also be assessed before each intravenous bisphosphonate infusion to assure that the child is not hypocalcemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children&quot;, section on 'Terminology for dietary standards'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-in-children-and-adolescents#H23365817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Targets for vitamin D intake'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13635558\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous versus oral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data directly comparing intravenous and oral bisphosphonate therapy in children with OI. In one small, randomized trial comparing oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> for children with OI, BMD increased similarly in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Nonetheless, many clinicians believe that intravenous pamidronate is more effective in treating bone pain and possibly has a greater effect on fracture risk reduction than oral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13635572\"><span class=\"h2\">In adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with OI may have a higher fracture risk than healthy peers because they are unlikely to reach an equivalent peak BMD. In addition, the structural defects of collagen may contribute to decreased bone strength, independently of BMD, thereby increasing the risk of fractures. Postmenopausal bone loss beginning from a lower than normal peak may increase fracture risk in untreated women with OI compared with postmenopausal women in general. Thus, treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or bisphosphonates should be considered immediately after menopause to prevent accelerated bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in women with the superimposed problems of postmenopausal osteoporosis and OI (self-history or family history). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Little information on treatment in adults with OI is available. In one study, 23 men and 23 premenopausal women with OI (types I, III, and IV) were randomized to intravenous neridronate 100 mg every three months or no treatment (ratio 2 to 1) for a period of one year, with both groups receiving treatment the second year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The average age of the population was 35 years, and mean lumbar spine BMD T score was -3.4. BMD increased significantly from baseline in the treatment group and compared with the control group. After two years, BMD increased 6.4 and 7.5 percent in males and females, respectively, in the treatment group. The risk of clinical fractures tended to decrease during treatment with neridronate, although the study was not powered for such an endpoint. Neridronate is not available in the United States.</p><p>In an observational study, 90 adults with OI (types I, III, and IV) were treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> (n = 28), oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> (n = 10), oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> (n = 17), or not treated (n = 35) for an average of 52 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteogenesis-imperfecta-management-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A significantly increasing rate of BMD per year of treatment was seen in all types of OI treated with pamidronate but only in patients with type I OI treated with oral bisphosphonates. Fracture rate decreased significantly only in the type <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> patients treated with pamidronate.</p><p>Off-label bisphosphonate treatment of adults with OI must be considered on a case-by-case basis and in general should be based upon the assessment of fracture risk using BMD and clinical risk factors, such as history of nontraumatic fracture, family history of osteoporosis, weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption in addition to the risk associated with OI. The relative contribution of OI, besides low BMD, to the fracture risk in adults as a result of defective bone quality is unknown. Nevertheless, we suggest that the therapeutic threshold should be lower for adults with OI with the same level of fracture risk as compared with those without OI.

Large-bore intravenous access should be obtained before major surgical procedures to allow rapid administration of fluid and blood products. In addition, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should probably be avoided because of their antiplatelet effects.<strong> </strong>Bleeding time and coagulations tests should be obtained prior to any surgical procedure.
