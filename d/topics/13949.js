For postpartum women, additional issues include the timing of contraceptive initiation, risk of venous thromboembolism, resumption of ovulation, and impact on lactation. Prompt initiation of postpartum contraception increases utilization and continuation and thus reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy. The woman's preferences and the risks and benefits of various contraceptive options are ideally discussed during prenatal care so the woman has adequate time to consider her options and have her questions answered.</p><p>This topic will review contraception issues specific to postpartum women. Discussions on contraceptive counseling and selection and postabortion contraception are presented separately.

As many as 60 percent of these ovulations are potentially fertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since the first ovulation often occurs before the first menses, we educate women that return of menses cannot be used as a reliable marker for when to initiate contraception.</p><p>For breastfeeding women, the resumption of ovulation appears to be influenced by the frequency and duration of breastfeeding. In an observational study of 200 postpartum women, the women who breastfed less had a quicker resumption of ovulation compared with women who breastfed exclusively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, exclusively breastfeeding women typically ovulated after the first menses as compared with non-breastfeeding women, who typically ovulated prior to the resumption of menses. In a different study of 101 breastfeeding women (60 women in Baltimore, Maryland, United States and 41 women in Manila, Philippines), the resumption of ovulation occurred at a mean of 27 and 38 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this study, the women in Baltimore tended to breastfeed less frequently, but for a longer duration at each episode, compared with the women in the Philippines. During the first six months postpartum, approximately 10 percent of all amenorrheic women ovulated. Among women who were exclusively breastfeeding, 1 to 5 percent of amenorrheic women ovulated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2517339107\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who exclusively breastfeed typically have a delay in resumption of ovulation postpartum due to prolactin-induced inhibition of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus. The degree to which breastfeeding suppresses ovulation is modulated by the intensity of the breastfeeding, the basal nutritional status of the mother, and the body mass index of the mother. While breastfeeding is associated with subfertility, anovulation is likely only when <strong>all </strong>of the following specific conditions are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than six months postpartum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding exclusively (ie, not providing food or other liquid to the infant and no interval of &gt;4 to 6 hours between feeding episodes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amenorrhea</p><p/><p>Under these conditions, there is approximately 98 percent protection from pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The insertion technique for postpartum women is the same as for nonpregnant women.

Interval insertion typically occurs six weeks after delivery, although intervals as short as two to three weeks have been reported without adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The differing times of IUD insertion do not appear to affect the rates of adverse events such as pain, bleeding, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], but immediate and delayed insertions are associated with higher rates of expulsion than interval insertion.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states immediate IUD insertion should be offered to women who desire an IUD and do not have intrauterine infection, postpartum hemorrhage, or puerperal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

We counsel women that while post-placental insertion of progestin-releasing IUDs represents off-label use, it is also a reasonable treatment option.

Expulsion rates range from 10 to 40 percent following immediate insertion, 29 to 41 percent for delayed insertion, and approximately 4 percent for interval insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/28,41,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41,56,57</a>]. For comparison, during the first year after IUD insertion in non-postpartum women, expulsion occurs following 3 to 10 percent of copper IUD insertions and 3 to 6 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> IUD insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/58-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-63</a>]. As delayed insertion is associated with the highest expulsion rates, it is mainly used for women who express desire for an IUD at a time later than immediately postpartum but prior to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/36,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,56</a>]. Of note, one limitation of these data is that there are few studies that assess long-term outcomes of post-placental IUD insertion. Until further data are available, we advise counseling women regarding the increased possibility of IUD expulsion with immediate and delayed insertion (compared with interval insertion) and also suggest facilitating office visits following insertion to check for expulsion, and to expedite replacement, if appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications#H3108373607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications&quot;, section on 'Expulsion'</a>.)</p><p>At least one study has reported that the expulsion rate may differ between levonorgestrel-releasing and copper IUDs. In a prospective observational study of 350 women electing immediate postpartum insertion of either an IUD (copper or levonorgestrel-releasing device) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a>, women with a levonorgestrel-releasing device were nearly six times more likely to experience expulsion by six months postpartum compared with copper device users (expulsion rates of 17 versus 4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In this study, the rate of expulsion did not differ by delivery type. Of the 21 women with an expulsion, 14 (67 percent) requested a replacement long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC). Despite the expulsions, the six-month continuation rate was 80 percent or greater for both devices. Until data are available from larger, randomly assigned trials, we counsel women that the levonorgestrel-releasing devices may have higher expulsion rates, although the overall rate is within the range of expulsion reported in other studies of postpartum IUD insertion.</p><p>Despite the higher expulsion rate following immediate insertion, immediate postpartum IUD insertion appears more likely to result in continued contraceptive use than interval insertion, possibly because a greater percentage of women have the device inserted when immediate insertion is available. In a trial comparing immediate postpartum insertion with six-week interval insertion, a higher proportion of women in the immediate insertion group were using the IUD at six months of follow-up compared with interval insertion (83 versus 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. A meta-analysis of 15 trials that had at least one treatment arm that included immediate postpartum IUD placement concluded that, while the body of evidence regarding risk of expulsion is limited by small sample size, the &ldquo;benefit of effective contraception immediately after delivery may outweigh the disadvantage of increased risk of expulsion&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193201628\"><span class=\"h4\">Risk of infection or uterine perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IUDs can be placed in postpartum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lactating women unless they have chorioamnionitis, endometritis, or puerperal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].

This study included nulliparous and postpartum women but did not specify the postpartum timing of IUD insertion. Immediate, rather than delayed, insertion appeared to lower the risk of perforation in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Breastfeeding appears to independently increase the risk of uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/72-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-76</a>]. In a reanalysis of a study of over 60,000 IUD users that defined uterine perforation as full penetration of the myometrial wall, the incidence of uterine perforation per 1000 insertions was 4.5 for lactating women compared with 0.6 per 1000 for nonlactating women, for a crude relative risk of 7.7 (95% CI 4.6-12.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

It is important to remember that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels will typically take two to four weeks, but sometimes longer, to resolve after delivery (hCG levels are higher earlier in pregnancy than later in pregnancy). If pregnancy testing is positive in this setting, the woman is encouraged to use back-up (eg, condom) contraception while serial quantitative serum hCG levels are assessed to determine if the levels are declining from the index pregnancy or if the woman is newly pregnant. If hCG levels are notably declining, any of the contraceptive methods can be initiated while the hCG drop is followed.

Women who exclusively breastfeed typically have a delay in resumption of ovulation postpartum, but return of menses cannot be used as a reliable marker for when to initiate contraception. (See <a href=\"#H2127655682\" class=\"local\">'Resumption of ovulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are appropriate candidates, advantages of initiating contraception immediately postpartum include that the woman is known not to be pregnant, leaves with a reliable contraceptive method, does not need to return for an additional visit, and is less likely to have an unintended pregnancy or short inter-birth interval. For women with medical comorbidities, contraceptive eligibility is detailed in the table by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2736\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H2447566788\" class=\"local\">'Long-acting reversible contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> is 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>), has a high continuation rate, and has no risks specific to the postpartum period except for theoretical issues related to breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H3544837958\" class=\"local\">'Etonogestrel implant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IUDs (copper-containing or levonorgestrel-releasing devices) are 99 percent effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>) and have high continuation rates but are also associated with higher rates of expulsion when placed post-placentally in postpartum women. For postpartum women who desire an IUD, the device can be inserted immediately after delivery (immediate or post-placental insertion), up to 72 hours after delivery (delayed insertion), or three or more weeks postpartum (interval insertion). Immediate insertion is associated with a higher risk of expulsion but improved utilization rates compared with interval insertion. Although there are more data on immediate postpartum insertion of copper IUDs, immediate insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs is also reasonable (see <a href=\"#H640923987\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine contraception'</a> above). Perforation rates appear to be higher in breastfeeding women, especially more proximal to delivery, then in non-breastfeeding women, although perforation is still an uncommon complication. (See <a href=\"#H961532810\" class=\"local\">'Insertion timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are interested in LARC, we counsel about the differences between the implant and the IUDs, including differences in risk after postpartum initiation and differences in side effects and efficacy. Some women prefer the implant specifically because of no risks unique to postpartum initiation. Others prefer aspects of the IUDs such as length of use and side-effect profiles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no contraindications to starting progestin-only contraceptives immediately after delivery in non-breastfeeding women. We counsel breastfeeding women that immediate start of progestin-only methods is reasonable as the benefits of immediate contraception are believed to outweigh the theoretical risk of impairing lactogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H3834161894\" class=\"local\">'Short-acting hormonal contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be highest in the first 21 days postpartum and then declines over time to reach baseline levels 16 weeks after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H2536069218\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The start time for combined hormonal contraception varies with breastfeeding status and VTE risk, as combined hormonal contraception is associated with an increased risk of VTE independent of the risk conferred by the postpartum state. (See <a href=\"#H2536069218\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For non-breastfeeding women with no additional VTE risk factors, combined hormonal contraception is started no sooner than 21 days (three weeks) after delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1944034739\" class=\"local\">'Impact of estrogen treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are breastfeeding with no additional VTE risk factors, combined hormonal contraception is started 28 days (four weeks) postpartum. (See <a href=\"#H1944034739\" class=\"local\">'Impact of estrogen treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who have transient postpartum VTE risk factors but are otherwise acceptable candidates for estrogen-progestin contraception, combined hormonal contraception start is delayed until six weeks postpartum, regardless of breastfeeding status. (See <a href=\"#H1944034739\" class=\"local\">'Impact of estrogen treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female tubal sterilization can be performed after a vaginal or cesarean delivery. Ideally, postpartum procedures are performed immediately after delivery or within 24 hours so as not to increase the difficulty due to uterine involution or the risk of infection. The modified Pomeroy technique is the most common sterilization procedure performed and has a failure rate of less than 1 percent. (See <a href=\"#H203292223\" class=\"local\">'Sterilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier methods, including the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, and condoms (male and female), can be started at any time postpartum and, because they do not contain hormones, have no impact on lactation or thromboembolism risk. The main disadvantage for all barrier methods is lower efficacy compared with long-acting reversible contraception and hormonal contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>).
