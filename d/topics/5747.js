Everyone has them, and they do not usually cause problems. But there are different types of E. coli. Some types cause disease. Eating or drinking something with one of these types in it can cause diarrhea and other symptoms.</p><p>When E. coli causes disease, it usually happens in the digestive system. But E. coli can sometimes cause illness if it gets into areas of the body where it does not normally live. For example, E. coli can cause a urinary tract infection if it gets into the urinary tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985225\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of E. coli infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of E. coli infection of the digestive system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; This can be watery or bloody, and mild or severe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting &ndash; This is more common in babies infected with one specific type of E. coli.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985240\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have more than 6 runny bowel movements in 24 hours.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have diarrhea for longer than 48 hours.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have bloody diarrhea.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 100.4&ordm;F (38&ordm;C).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe belly pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have diarrhea or fever and are age 70 or older.</p><p/><p>You should also see a doctor or nurse if your body has lost too much water from diarrhea. This is called &quot;dehydration.&quot; Signs of dehydration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having lots of diarrhea that is very watery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirst</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry mouth or tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness, especially when you stand up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that is very yellow, or not needing to urinate for more than 5 hours</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985255\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need tests for E. coli. But the doctor or nurse might want to do: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p>The types of E. coli that cause diarrhea can sometimes also cause problems with the kidneys or blood. These problems can be serious. If you get sick with E. coli, doctors might do tests to check for these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985270\"><span class=\"h1\">How is E. coli infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people do not need any specific treatment. Diarrhea from E. coli is not usually treated with antibiotic medicines. With some types of E. coli that cause diarrhea, antibiotics might actually make the illness worse. But if E. coli causes symptoms in other parts of the body, you might need antibiotics.</p><p>People who get dehydrated might need fluids through a thin tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; The tube goes into a vein. This treatment is usually given in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985285\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have diarrhea, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink a lot of liquids that have water, salt, and sugar. Good choices are soup broth and water mixed with juice. If you are drinking enough fluids, your urine will be light yellow or almost clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a little food if you feel hungry. Good choices are potatoes, noodles, rice, oatmeal, crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables. Salty foods help the most.</p><p/><p>Ask your doctor or nurse before you take any over-the-counter medicines for diarrhea. If you have E. coli infection, some of these medicines can be harmful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821985300\"><span class=\"h1\">Can E. coli infection be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce your chances of getting and spreading E. coli, be sure to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands after changing diapers, cooking, eating, going to the bathroom, taking out the trash, or touching animals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay home from work or school until you feel better, if you get diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pay attention to food safety.
