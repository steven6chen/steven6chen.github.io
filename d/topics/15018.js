Hypogonadism may result in anovulation, infertility, or oligomenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The menstrual cycle typically remains irregular, with scanty flow, after the initiation of maintenance dialysis, although normal menses are restored in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. In others, menorrhagia develops, sometimes leading to significant blood loss and increased transfusion requirements.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Although rare, pregnancy can occur in women with advanced renal failure, but fetal wastage is markedly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some residual renal function is usually present in the infrequent pregnancy that can be carried to term. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL MENSTRUAL CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal menstrual cycle is divided into a <strong>follicular</strong> or proliferative phase and a <strong>luteal</strong> or secretory phase. During the follicular phase, gradually increasing secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) causes recruitment and maturation of a single ovum and increasing secretion of estradiol. When the estradiol concentration reaches a sufficiently high level, it stimulates a sudden increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, thereby causing the release of a mature ovum, called ovulation. LH then stimulates the remainder of the follicle, called the corpus luteum, to secrete both estradiol and progesterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL DISTURBANCES IN UREMIC PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of ovulation indirectly suggests that anovulatory cycles are the rule in uremic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This conclusion is supported by the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of progestational effect on the endometrium, as determined by biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of an increase in basal body temperature during the expected luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-menstrual-cycle-and-timing-of-ovulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the menstrual cycle and timing of ovulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of the preovulatory peak in luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol concentrations. The failure of LH to rise in part reflects a disturbance in the positive estradiol feedback pathway since the administration of exogenous estrogen to mimic the preovulatory surge in estradiol fails to stimulate LH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, feedback inhibition of gonadotropin release by low doses of estradiol remains intact. This can be illustrated by the ability of the antiestrogen <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> to enhance LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolactin and galactorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly have elevated circulating prolactin concentrations and galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] due to increased secretion and decreased metabolic clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be relatively autonomous as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar observations have been made in uremic males. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in uremic men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary function and contribute to varying degrees of hypogonadism, as manifest by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, sexual dysfunction, and galactorrhea. Dopamine agonists correct the hyperprolactinemia but do not restore normal menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>], thereby suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment goals for uremic women with sexual dysfunction include maximizing the delivered dose of dialysis, discontinuing culprit medications (if possible), and correcting the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). More specific measures are utilized based upon the underlying disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complaint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53114\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53114 \">figure 1</a>). Successful transplantation is clearly the most effective means to restore normal sexual function in women with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypogonadism (including oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the serum estradiol concentration is within the normal range for the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, the administration of a progestin (eg, 5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>) for 10 days each month will result in menses. This treatment may also reduce the chance that the endometrial hyperplasia that results from chronic stimulation of the endometrium with estradiol, but not progesterone, will lead to a predisposition to endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>If estradiol is low, the treatment should include replacement of estradiol as well as progesterone (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H1222519042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>). This treatment will correct all of the manifestations of estradiol deficiency. If there is a contraindication to systemic estradiol, a vaginal estrogen can relieve vaginal dryness.</p><p>If the prolactin is high, lowering it with a dopamine agonist might restore ovarian function, but this treatment has not been studied well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The chronic administration of a progestin frequently terminates menstrual flow in a woman with metrorrhagia; rarely, however, such patients will require a hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women on chronic dialysis, restoration of fertility as a therapeutic goal should be discouraged, although pregnancy can rarely occur spontaneously. In women with a well-functioning renal transplant, however, the abnormalities in ovulation can usually be reversed and successful pregnancy achieved (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a>). Uremic women who are menstruating normally should be encouraged to use birth control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased libido</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies exist concerning the therapy of decreased libido and sexual function in uremic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/6,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20-22</a>]. In one of the largest studies, women from 27 dialysis units in Europe and South America were assessed using a 19-item questionnaire (the Female Sexual Function Index) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Only 659 of 1472 women completed the questionnaire. Of the 659 women, sexual dysfunction was reported by 555 (84 percent) and was independently associated with age, symptoms of depression, less education, menopause, and diuretic therapy. Nearly all women who did not have a partner and were not waitlisted for a kidney transplant reported sexual dysfunction. The generalizability of this study to all women on dialysis is limited by the low response rate. In addition, the observational nature of the study prevents conclusions regarding causality; as an example, the use of diuretics was likely just a marker for comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8618388\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disturbances in menstruation, fertility, and sexual dysfunction are common in women with chronic kidney disease (CKD), all due to varying degrees of hypogonadism as a consequence of suppression of gonadotropins. Most women have amenorrhea by the time they reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD), although menorrhagia leading to significant blood loss and increased transfusion requirements develops in some women.
