The infection usually causes sudden fever, headache, and a dry cough. It most often affects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who own a pet bird, such as a cockatiel, parakeet, parrot, or macaw</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who own or run a pet shop</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Veterinarians (animal doctors)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who work in chicken, duck, or turkey processing plants</p><p/><p>Other names for psittacosis are &quot;parrot fever&quot; and &quot;ornithosis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684645640\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of psittacosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms usually start 5 to 14 days after being around an infected bird. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (often comes on suddenly)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache (usually severe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shivering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry cough (this can develop later than other symptoms)</p><p/><p>In severe cases, psittacosis can cause serious problems with the lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. In a pregnant woman, the infection can be very dangerous, even deadly, especially if the woman is infected late in pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684645655\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have symptoms of psittacosis and own a pet bird or have been around birds that might have been infected, see your doctor or nurse. Similar symptoms can occur with other infections, such as the flu. But your doctor or nurse can help figure out which infection is making you ill and give you the proper treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684645670\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have psittacosis, he or she will order a blood test to help confirm this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684645687\"><span class=\"h1\">How is psittacosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment involves taking antibiotics, usually for 7 to 10 days. If you are put on antibiotics to treat psittacosis, it's very important that you take all your pills, even if you feel better before you finish them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684645702\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bird-flu-avian-influenza-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bird flu (avian influenza) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
