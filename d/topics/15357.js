The technique improves sonographic detection of endometrial pathology, such as polyps, hyperplasia, cancer, leiomyomas, and adhesions. In addition, it can help avoid invasive diagnostic procedures in some patients as well as optimize the preoperative triage process for those women who require therapeutic intervention. It is easily and rapidly performed at minimal cost, well-tolerated by patients, and is virtually devoid of complications. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in conjunction with the American College of Radiology and the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, developed a technology assessment document for saline infusion sonohysterography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of situations where fluid enhanced endovaginal scanning will aid evaluation of the uterine cavity. The American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine's standard indications and contraindications to this procedure are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73097 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Unscheduled uterine bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unexpected uterine bleeding accounts for a large proportion of gynecologic patient visits. Endometrial biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> office hysteroscopy are often used as initial diagnostic procedures; in hospital dilation and curettage is no longer considered an appropriate initial diagnostic test in most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound is used increasingly as an initial triage for patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. Sonohysterography is a subset of transvaginal sonography that is used when it is difficult to visualize the endometrium or the endometrium is thickened.</p><p>Sonohysterography is particularly useful for finding focal endometrial abnormalities or confirming that a focal abnormality diagnosed by transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound is present and better defining the nature of the abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, one study performed both transvaginal ultrasonographic examination and sonohysterography on 106 patients with menometrorrhagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of saline infusion sonohysterography for detection of polyps were significantly higher than for transvaginal ultrasound alone (93 and 94 versus 75 and 76 percent for TVS) and were comparable to hysteroscopy, a finding confirmed by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p>In addition, a prospective series of 214 consecutive pre- and postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding and a suspected uterine abnormality on TVS found an initial approach of sonohysterography followed by hysteroscopy, if needed for diagnosis or therapy, was preferable to routinely proceeding to diagnostic hysteroscopy because the latter could be avoided in 84 percent of patients (sonohysterography was conclusive in 180 of 214 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although some women subsequently underwent operative hysteroscopy for treatment of uterine abnormalities, an initial approach using diagnostic hysteroscopy under conditions allowing operative hysteroscopy if needed was also deemed unsatisfactory because preparation for the combined procedure requires general or regional anesthesia, despite the knowledge that a significant portion of women will have no anatomic abnormality and will not have a surgical intervention.</p><p>In addition, sonohysterography can help to reliably distinguish between:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenopausal women with anovulatory bleeding, which is best treated hormonally, from those with an anatomic lesion, which may require tissue sampling for histologic diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resection for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Blind sampling procedures are justified if an abnormality is symmetrically 'pan uterine'. When focal lesions (eg, polyps, fibroids, some hyperplasias, some carcinomas) are detected, then directed biopsies are preferable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial assessment is part of the routine evaluation of infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;</a>.) Saline infusion sonohysterography is useful for detecting potential anatomic causes of reduced fertility, such as submucous myomas, endometrial polyps, anomalies, and intrauterine adhesions and appears comparable to or better than hysterosalpingography (HSG) or hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/1,2,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15-18</a>].</p><p>However, an outline of the fallopian tubes (as seen with HSG) is not observed with sonohysterography. Accretion of instilled fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac is a sign of patency of at least one tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tamoxifen-induced changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a>, a potent antiestrogen, is being used extensively as adjunctive chemotherapy in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Some patients taking tamoxifen, when viewed with endovaginal ultrasound, will display thickened central uterine echoes. These changes are sometimes polyps or abnormal endometrial tissue (proliferative, hyperplasia, or even cancer). However, sonohysterography has shown that these changes can often represent microcysts of the basalis of the endometrium or proximal myometrium that develop due to reactivation of focal adenomyosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, sonohysterography can help to define suspected endometrial abnormalities noted on transvaginal ultrasound examination and avoid tissue sampling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70071%7EOBGYN%2F62592\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70071 graphicRef62592 \">image 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80525 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>Routine sonographic screening of the endometrium of asymptomatic women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> has not been recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This is a controversial area; some investigators have proposed that patients embarking on tamoxifen therapy should have pretreatment screening to determine if they have underlying endometrial abnormalities, such as polyps or endometrial hyperplasia, which place them at high risk of developing into or progressing to atypical hyperplasia. Such patients warrant ongoing periodic surveillance, which is best accomplished by transvaginal ultrasound and then sonohysterography if the endometrial echo is not adequately seen or not reliably thin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Low risk patients could be followed according to the ACOG guidelines, which are briefly described above and in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-the-side-effects-of-tamoxifen#H94636198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing the side effects of tamoxifen&quot;, section on 'Screening for uterine tumors'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination is typically scheduled early in the follicular phase of the cycle, after menstrual flow has ceased and before day 10, as the endometrium is very thin at this point in the cycle. Later in the cycle, focal irregularities in the contour of the endometrium may be mistaken for small polyps or focal areas of endometrial hyperplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74592\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74592 \">image 2</a>). One prospective blinded study reported a 27 percent false positive rate in sonohysterography performed from day 16 to 28, but no false positive when the procedure was performed prior to day 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Sometimes the patient has such irregular bleeding that she cannot tell what is an actual menses. In such cases, it can be helpful to use an empiric course of a progestin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 10 mg daily for 10 days, to create a &quot;medical curettage&quot; and then time the ultrasound evaluation to the withdrawal bleed.</p><p>Anesthesia or analgesia is not required as the intrauterine insemination catheter is relatively painless while being inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The procedure is well tolerated by the overwhelming majority of patients; a few experience minimal cramping.</p><p>A bimanual examination may be performed initially to determine the position and mobility of the uterus, although the initial transvaginal sonography can usually determine the degree of anteversion or retroversion, if present. The speculum is inserted and the cervix cleansed with a 10 percent iodine-based solution. A variety of commercially available sonohysterography catheters can be utilized. Most of these have similar efficacy, but vary in small design elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Insertion can be with ring forceps, using a spear-like motion (for less flexible catheters), or with an internal stylet. To prevent run back of fluid, some employ an acorn-like device and others have a balloon.</p><p>The catheter should be flushed with sterile saline or water prior to insertion to rid it of small amounts of air, which would cause an echogenic artifactual appearance. The speculum is then removed carefully to avoid dislodging the catheter. The catheter will still extend beyond the introitus when positioned in the uterus.</p><p>When a balloon catheter is employed, it appears that intracervical catheter placement causes less pain and requires less saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a small randomized trial, women who had intracervical rather than intrauterine catheter placement reported significantly less pain at initial catheter balloon inflation and also required 50 percent less saline to perform the procedure. The catheter is inserted to the fundus by grasping the catheter with a ring forceps and gently feeding it through the cervical os.</p><p>The vaginal probe is then reinserted and a syringe filled with sterile fluid rid of air bubbles is attached to the catheter. Fluid is instilled while the transducer is moved from side to side (cornua to cornua) in a long axis projection. The amount of instilled fluid will vary, depending upon the image produced on the ultrasound monitor.</p><p>After the uterus has been completely surveyed from cornua to cornua in a long-axis projection, the transducer is rotated 90 degrees into a coronal plane. More fluid is instilled while fanning down towards the endocervical canal and up towards the uterine fundus to recreate three-dimensional anatomy. Every portion of the uterine cavity should be imaged, because polyps, hyperplasia, or carcinomas may be focal. A reliable assessment requires that the endometrial echo be homogeneous, surrounded by an intact hypoechoic junctional zone, and that the operator constantly remember that the endometrial cavity is a three-dimensional structure. Failure to meticulously recreate three dimensional anatomy will result in error.</p><p>Three-dimensional ultrasound equipment will eliminate error that may occur if the operator does not pay meticulous attention to mentally recreating three dimensional anatomy. It usually requires a balloon catheter to prevent run back of fluid and results in increased patient cramping and discomfort. A prospective study showed no advantage of three-dimension sonohysterography over two-dimensional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], although both types had significantly better sensitivity and specificity than ultrasound without fluid enhancement.</p><p>Some initial reports utilizing a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel containing anesthetic and antiseptic agents have proposed this as an alternative to saline or water. This may allow stable filling of the cavity without continuous injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal sonohysterogram is shown for comparison with the abnormalities below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74520\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74520 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical sonohysterographic appearance of an endometrial polyp is a well-defined, homogeneous, polypoid lesion isoechoic to the endometrium with preservation of the endometrial-myometrial interface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In one study, this techniques had a positive predictive value of 81.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Submucosal fibroids are usually well-defined, broad-based, hypoechoic, solid masses with shadowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The overlying layer of endometrium is echogenic and distorts the endometrial-myometrial interface. Atypical features include pedunculation or a multilobulated surface. Sonohysterography's major benefit over transvaginal ultrasound alone is that it more accurately shows how much of the fibroid projects into the endometrial cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55785%7EOBGYN%2F50777\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55785 graphicRef50777 \">image 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>].

When patients who have undergone this type of procedure subsequently have abnormal premenopausal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding, routine methods of endometrial evaluation are often suboptimal, including sonohysterography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONCERNS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficulty passing the catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, it will be difficult to thread the flexible catheter into place because of cervical stenosis, uterine position, or abnormal uterine contour. Changing the toe of the speculum by moving the handle up or down may change the angle of the cervix with the fundus and will often allow successful insertion of the catheter. A catheter with a stylet or one made of less flexible material also can be useful. A cervical stabilizer rather than a standard tenaculum is another acceptable option.

Even a small ribbon of sonolucent fluid will allow good visualization of endometrial contents on either side of the fluid. However, women with a patulous cervix may not retain even the small amount of fluid needed to visualize the endometrium. Sometimes there is excessive leakage of fluid out the fallopian tubes. Slow injection of fluid using minimal pressure can sometimes overcome these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of upper genital tract infection is similar to that with hysteroscopy or traditional hysterosalpingogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/saline-infusion-sonohysterography/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Obtaining appropriate cultures and prescribing prophylactic antibiotics depend upon the patient's risk factors and clinician preference. Risk factors for pelvic infection include women with multiple partners, having a partner with dysuria or urethral discharge, young age, and previous sexually transmitted disease or pelvic inflammatory disease.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine's standard indications and contraindications to this procedure are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73097 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with abnormal uterine bleeding in whom endometrial sampling is indicated, a clinician may obtain saline instillation sonohysterography prior to the sampling procedure. Blind sampling procedures are most useful if an abnormality is symmetrically 'pan uterine'. When focal lesions (eg, polyps, fibroids, some hyperplasias, some carcinomas) are detected, then directed biopsies are preferable. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Unscheduled uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline infusion sonohysterography is useful for detecting potential anatomic causes of reduced fertility, such as submucous myomas, endometrial polyps, anomalies, and intrauterine adhesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examination is scheduled when the endometrium will be as thin as possible from the last day or two of staining until three to four days after the bleeding has ended. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the balloon catheter be inserted intracervically rather than intrauterine into the uterus to minimize pain and saline volume. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of upper genital tract infection is similar to that with a traditional hysterosalpingogram. Whether cultures are obtained and prophylactic antibiotics prescribed depends upon the patient's risk factors and clinician preference. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False positive findings have been attributed to blood clots, intrauterine debris, mucus plugs, shearing of normal endometrium, thickened endometrial folds, and misidentified endometrial fragments. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'False positive findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure-related side effects and complications are mild and uncommon.
