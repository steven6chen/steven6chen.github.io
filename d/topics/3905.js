It was initially considered a variant of rheumatoid arthritis, but subsequently emerged as a distinct clinical entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Historically, seronegativity for rheumatoid factor (RF) had been a requirement for the diagnosis; however, over 10 percent of patients with uncomplicated psoriasis and up to 15 percent of the normal population have RF present in their serum. As a result, the term &quot;usually seronegative&quot; arthritis is most suitable for PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PsA are discussed here. The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder and overviews of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of psoriasis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) affects women and men equally, with an incidence of approximately 6 per 100,000 per year and a prevalence of about 1 to 2 per 1000 in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,3,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5-8</a>]. Estimates of the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis among patients with psoriasis have ranged from 4 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. These estimates have some limitations, as indicated by a 2008 systematic review of reports from 1987 to 2006 that found marked variability of the reported incidence and prevalence estimates in the general population and suggested that different definitions, as well as geography, may contribute to the variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similar concerns apply to the analyses of patients with psoriasis.</p><p>A multicenter trial in Europe of 1560 patients with psoriasis estimated that 31 percent of the patients would have PsA after 30 years of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this study, the risk of developing PsA did not decrease with time. Another study of 1511 patients with psoriasis from academic and community dermatology practices in Germany identified 21 percent of the patients as having PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Using the internationally agreed-upon Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> below), which were first proposed in 2006, the estimated prevalence of PsA among patients with psoriasis in two large general practices in the United Kingdom was 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, four studies from 2012 and 2013 of PsA among patients with psoriasis demonstrated a prevalence of 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/11,12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,18,19</a>]. In a population-based study of two large general practices in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of arthritis in psoriasis patients was 13.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A prospective, four-year study of patients with psoriasis who did not have PsA at presentation found an incidence of newly diagnosed PsA, also based upon the CASPAR criteria, of almost 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this study, the severity of psoriasis, the presence of nail lesions, and the presence of scalp and intergluteal lesions were more likely to occur in those with PsA.</p><p>The frequency of inflammatory back pain and axial spondyloarthritis in patients with psoriasis were examined using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2009 to 2010, which included 148 patients with psoriasis among 5103 patients who were queried regarding issues related to back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patients with psoriasis exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of inflammatory back pain and spondyloarthritis (about 17 versus 5 and 14 versus 2 percent, respectively).</p><p>Among patients presenting with previously undiagnosed arthritis, PsA is present in a small minority. As an example, in one prospective study of 1018 patients with &quot;early synovitis,&quot; PsA was diagnosed in 129 patients (13 percent), a minority of whom (6 percent) did not have psoriasis at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A prospective study of patients with psoriasis, who did not have arthritis at presentation and were then followed annually, found the annual incidence of PsA to be 2.7 to 3.2 percent; the lower number was based upon confirmation by a rheumatologic assessment and use of the CASPAR criteria (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> below), while the higher number included those patients as well as patients screening positive on a validated screening questionnaire (see <a href=\"#H3322301629\" class=\"local\">'Screening and classification'</a> below) who were unavailable for confirmatory in-person evaluation by the study rheumatologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6558525\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) present with pain and stiffness in the affected joints. Morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes occurs in one-half of patients. The stiffness is accentuated with prolonged immobility and is alleviated by physical activity. A history of psoriasis is present in about 70 percent of patients presenting with arthritis.</p><p>On physical examination, stress pain, joint line tenderness, and effusions in the affected joints are present, often in an asymmetric distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and spine are each affected in 40 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. About 15 percent of patients with PsA will have evidence of psoriasis on examination despite lacking a history of known psoriatic skin disease.</p><p>Patients with PsA may be less tender on physical examination than patients with other inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It most frequently presents as a polyarthritis or (less often) as an oligoarthritis; however, it has several other patterns of joint involvement that, while less common, are much more typical of PsA than other disorders. Enthesitis, tenosynovitis, and dactylitis may also occur.</p><p>The clinical patterns, which were originally described by Moll and Wright, include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal arthritis, characterized by involvement of the DIP joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70503%7ERHEUM%2F79872\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70503 graphicRef79872 \">picture 1A-B</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric oligoarthritis, in which less than five small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large joints are affected in an asymmetric distribution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetric polyarthritis, similar to and, at times, indistinguishable from rheumatoid arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis mutilans, characterized by deforming and destructive arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51683 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58184\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58184 \">image 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spondyloarthritis (SpA), including both sacroiliitis and spondylitis</p><p/><p>Some patients present with more than one pattern, and many change the pattern of their arthritis during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Most of the patients in the original description had an oligoarticular presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, subsequent studies have not found the same distribution in all patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although the disease may occur as a peripheral arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SpA, the SpA is usually present in association with peripheral joint involvement and occurs alone in only 2 to 4 percent of patients.</p><p>In a prospective cross-sectional observational study, the frequency on radiographs of axial involvement in patients with PsA was 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The patients with axial involvement were more likely to present with an earlier onset of arthritis, more severe nail onycholysis, symptoms of axial inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease, and were more often human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*27-positive. Axial disease was associated with clinically impactful measures of disease activity, disability, and spinal motion that were equal in magnitude to those observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p>Distal arthritis and arthritis mutilans are considered most specific for PsA, but they are not the most common patterns seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/5,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30,32</a>]. Distal involvement alone occurs in less than 20 percent of cases and may be associated with SpA, while arthritis mutilans can occur with any of the patterns.</p><p>Because the clinical patterns described above can change over time in an individual patient, the clinical manifestations of PsA are most commonly described using the following clinical domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dactylitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin and nail disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6558699\"><span class=\"h4\">Periarticular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other common rheumatologic features of PsA include tenosynovitis and soft tissue inflammation similar to that seen in other forms of SpA (or &quot;seronegative arthritides&quot;), such as enthesitis and dactylitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis &ndash; Enthesitis (inflammation at the site of the insertion of tendons, ligaments, and synovium into bone), eg, of the Achilles tendon, the plantar fascia, and the pelvic bones. Subclinical Achilles tendinitis, detected ultrasonographically, is more common in those with psoriasis than in healthy persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Assessment tools for enthesitis have been developed for use in research. While some work better for assessment of enthesitis of ankylosing spondylitis, others work better for PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One study identified enthesitis in 35 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenosynovitis &ndash; Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons of the hands, of the extensor carpi ulnaris, or at other sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dactylitis &ndash; Dactylitis, characterized by diffuse swelling of an entire finger or toe, often termed a &quot;sausage digit.&quot; Dactylitis is defined as uniform swelling of the soft tissues between the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, such that the digits are swollen diffusely. In dactylitis, joint swelling, which may be present, can no longer be recognized independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Sausage digits occur in nearly one-half of patients with PsA and are associated with an increased risk of progressive radiographic joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This abnormality is thought to result from inflammation of soft tissues, including the tendon sheaths, and from the concomitant inflammation of the adjacent joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This finding is suggestive of PsA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67123 \">picture 3</a>). A research tool to quantify dactylitis has been developed and has proven to be reliable and sensitive to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6559055\"><span class=\"h4\">Relation between arthritis and skin lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arthritis appears after the onset of skin lesions in the majority of patients. However, the arthritis precedes the skin disease in approximately 13 to 17 percent of patients, and skin lesions are present but have not been diagnosed in an additional 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one study the psoriasis skin phenotypes associated with a higher risk of PsA were scalp lesions (hazard ratio [HR] 3.9, 95% CI 2.2-6.9), nail dystrophy (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.1), and <span class=\"nowrap\">intergluteal/perianal</span> lesions (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Only a minority of patients note a relationship between the activity of the skin and joint manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], although some studies have suggested that PsA occurs more commonly among patients with severe psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/3,10,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,44</a>]. Many patients with severe PsA have few skin manifestations, while other patients present with severe skin psoriasis and have either no joint disease or only minimal joint inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nail lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic features of psoriasis affecting the nail bed and nail matrix include nail pits, onycholysis, nail bed hyperkeratosis, and splinter hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The nail pits and onycholysis that occur in PsA are indistinguishable from the nail lesions that occur in uncomplicated psoriasis. Nail lesions occur in 80 to 90 percent of patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/4,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,43</a>], compared with 46 percent of those with psoriasis uncomplicated by arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nail changes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pits, which are sharply defined depressions in the plate caused by shedding of nail plate cells. They look as if someone has taken a pin and pricked the nail several times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62855 \">picture 4</a>). Pits usually occur in large numbers and involve several nails.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onycholysis, separation of the nail from its bed, which may involve the whole or only part of the nail.

A study using a validated nail psoriasis severity index found that nail involvement correlated with many clinical features of PsA, such as global severity and the number of tender or swollen joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pitting edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swelling of the hands or feet with pitting edema is sometimes a presenting feature of PsA.

The edema was often asymmetrical and occasionally preceded joint involvement.</p><p>Clinically apparent chronic lymphedema (which may be nonpitting) is a rare extraarticular manifestation of PsA, and lymphatic obstruction has been confirmed in some cases using lymphoscintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, similar symmetrical swelling of the upper extremities due to extensive tenosynovitis in the absence of impaired lymphatic function has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Uveitis may present insidiously with visual impairment or acutely with a painful red eye.</p><p>In one report, compared with the uveitis typically seen in other patients with SpA, the uveitis associated with PsA was more frequently bilateral, posterior to the lens, insidious in onset, chronic in duration, and more common in females, although all of these findings were still characteristic of less than half of the patients with uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Uveitis can occur in patients with peripheral arthritis only; patients with uveitis with axial SpA and PsA are more often male and HLA-B*27-positive than those with peripheral arthritis alone.

Major conditions that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> &ndash; Patients with PsA in the form of a polyarthritis can present in a fashion that may be indistinguishable from rheumatoid arthritis. However, involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, an asymmetric distribution of joint disease, spondyloarthritis (SpA), sausage digits, new bone formation on radiographs, cutaneous findings, and the characteristic nail manifestations of PsA all help to distinguish it from rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Only a small number of patients with PsA will test positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, while these tests are positive in a majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive arthritis</strong> &ndash; Asymmetric oligoarthritis, enthesitis, sausage digits, and back pain can be seen in patients with either reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter syndrome) or PsA. However, unlike reactive arthritis, a history of an antecedent infectious illness, with either genitourinary symptoms of urethritis or a dysenteric illness, would not be characteristic of PsA. In addition, some skin lesions may differ (although others may be similar), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity occurs more commonly in patients with reactive arthritis, but can also occur in PsA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease </strong>&ndash; The peripheral and axial arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease may occur in a very similar pattern to that seen in PsA; patients with either may exhibit symmetric or asymmetric oligoarthritis or sacroiliitis. Uveitis may occur in either condition and the frequency of psoriasis may be increased in patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Additionally, patients with PsA without bowel symptoms can have microscopic lesions in the bowel even when the gut mucosa is macroscopically normal. However, inflammatory bowel disease can usually be suspected based upon clinical findings and confirmed with endoscopic investigation and biopsy. Additionally, the nail disease and DIP joint involvement that may occur in PsA are not characteristics of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and radiographic findings may differ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatologic and ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Rare dermatologic diseases'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatologic and ocular manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Uveitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ankylosing spondylitis</strong> &ndash; Spinal disease that occurs in patients with PsA may be difficult to distinguish from ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Peripheral features of SpA, such as enthesitis and dactylitis, can occur in either condition. However, the presence of psoriasis and some radiographic features may help distinguish the two disorders. PsA is more often associated with the presence of asymmetric sacroiliitis, non-marginal syndesmophytes, asymmetric syndesmophytes, more frequent involvement of the cervical spine, and less frequent involvement of the lumbar spine.

The diagnosis of gout can be confirmed by finding monosodium urate crystals on examination of the synovial fluid. However, PsA and gout can coexist, and recognition of other findings that suggest PsA, such as nail changes, prominent DIP joint disease (especially in the absence of distal lower extremity joint disease), enthesitis, dactylitis, and axial disease would support the diagnosis of PsA in addition to gout in patients with positive findings on crystal examination (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteoarthritis </strong>&ndash; Both PsA and osteoarthritis may be characterized by involvement of the DIP joints, which may sometimes exhibit some inflammatory characteristics and can mimic PsA. PsA as the cause of DIP joint involvement can generally be distinguished from osteoarthritis with Heberden&rsquo;s nodes by the nodular bony change of osteoarthritis, the more diffuse swelling of the joint in PsA, and the presence of other findings of PsA, such as characteristic nail changes, inflammatory oligoarticular, polyarticular, and or axial disease, enthesitis, and dactylitis.

The arthritis may be peripheral, axial, or both. It can present as a symmetrical polyarthritis, an asymmetric oligoarthritis, arthritis of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, as a destructive arthritis termed arthritis mutilans, or as a spondyloarthritis (SpA). Patterns often overlap. Enthesitis, dactylitis (sausage digits), and tenosynovitis can occur. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of arthritis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis appears after the onset of skin lesions in the majority of patients with PsA. However, the arthritis precedes the skin disease in approximately 13 to 17 percent of patients, and skin lesions are present but have not been diagnosed in an additional 15 percent. (See <a href=\"#H6559055\" class=\"local\">'Relation between arthritis and skin lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic features of uncomplicated psoriasis may affect the nail bed in patients with PsA, including nail pits and onycholysis. Nail lesions occur in 80 to 90 percent of patients with PsA. The severity of psoriatic nail involvement correlates closely with the extent and severity of both skin and joint disease and is more common in those with DIP joint arthritis, although the extent of skin disease does not generally correlate with the degree of joint disease. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nail lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings in PsA are nonspecific, consistent with the acute phase response and the degree and chronicity of inflammation; acute phase reactants are elevated in only about 40 percent of the patients; there are no laboratory findings characteristic of PsA that distinguish it from other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Radiographic changes can develop in the course of PsA that exhibit a pattern usually not seen in other forms of inflammatory arthritis, including the coexistence of erosive changes and new bone formation. (See <a href=\"#H6559542\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PsA can generally be made in a patient who has both psoriasis and an inflammatory arthritis in a pattern typical of PsA. Other forms of arthritis can occur in patients with psoriasis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, reactive arthritis, and the arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease, and should be excluded as the cause of the patient&rsquo;s syndrome. This can generally be done based upon the pattern of joint involvement, laboratory testing, imaging, and synovial fluid analysis. Certain clinical features may suggest PsA in the absence of psoriasis (psoriatic arthritis sine psoriasis), such as distal joint involvement, an asymmetric distribution, nail lesions, dactylitis, and the family history.
