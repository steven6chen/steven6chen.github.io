The skin is the second most common primary extranodal site, second in frequency only to the gastrointestinal tract. The overall incidence of primary cutaneous lymphoma in Western countries is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 case per 100,000 people annually, of which approximately 20 percent represent primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (PCBCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The incidence varies geographically, with lower rates in Japan and Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The exact incidence of primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) is unknown.</p><p>PCMZL usually presents in the fifth or sixth decade of life, although patients as young as 15 years old have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Men are diagnosed approximately twice as often as women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The vast majority of cases occur in non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) has been associated with tattoo pigments, tick bites, and antigen injection, suggesting that they may develop from chronic antigenic stimulation by intradermally applied antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the cause is unknown in most cases.

By comparison, positive serologies were found in 8 percent of patients with extranodal B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall, none of 10 patients with cutaneous T cell NHL, and 3 percent of healthy blood donors. The predominant strain identified was <em>Borrelia afzelii</em>, a subtype that is a primary cause of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, of the 12 patients with PCBCL and positive <em>Borrelia</em> serologies, only two had clinical manifestations of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and only one had arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a similar series of 20 cases from Scotland, seven of the PCBCL lesions contained identifiable <em>Borrelia</em> DNA compared with only 1 of 40 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

There is usually a prominent narrow layer (Grenz zone) beneath the epidermis that is not infiltrated or involved in the same way as the lower layers of the dermis.</p><p>The infiltrates are comprised of small lymphocytes, marginal zone B cells (centrocyte-like cells), lymphoplasmacytoid cells, and plasma cells, admixed with small numbers of centroblast- or immunoblast-like cells and many reactive T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Reactive germinal centers are frequently observed. They may be surrounded by a population of small to medium-sized cells with irregular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant pale cytoplasm (marginal zone B cells). Monotypic plasma cells are often located at the periphery of the infiltrates and in the superficial dermis beneath the epidermis. </p><p>PAS-positive, immunoglobulin containing, intranuclear (Dutcher bodies) or intracytoplasmic (Russell bodies) inclusions may be present in cases with a predominance of lymphoplasmacytoid cells. Unlike extranodal marginal zone lymphoma occurring at other sites, PCMZL rarely show colonization of follicular structures, lymphoepithelial lesions or transformation into a diffuse large B cell lymphoma, though a relative increase in large transformed cells can be seen in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

At this time, flow cytometry cannot be routinely recommended as a replacement for immunohistochemical studies. This is principally because of the difficulty associated with making a single-cell suspension with this tumor type.</p><p>The postulated normal counterpart to PCMZL is a post-germinal center B cell. The neoplastic cells express CD20, CD22, CD79a, and BCL2 and are typically negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, and BCL6. Reactive germinal centers typically express BCL6 and CD10, but not BCL2. There is cytoplasmic expression of immunoglobulin with light chain restriction on paraffin sections as well as monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genotypic studies may be used to document clonality.

On cytogenetic and molecular testing, t(14;18), t(3;14), and t(11;18) have been reported in &lt;25, 10, and 7 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) requires a representative biopsy of involved skin and the exclusion of non-cutaneous disease. Excisional biopsies are preferred to punch biopsies, but if a punch biopsy is taken, the diameter should be at least 4 mm. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p>The biopsy specimen is evaluated for morphology, growth pattern, and immunohistochemical studies. A typical biopsy of PCMZL demonstrates a B cell infiltrate comprised of small to medium sized lymphocytes, often with a plasmacytoid appearance in a reactive germinal-center-like structure. B cell lineage is confirmed by expression of CD20 or CD79a and the absence of CD3 expression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) present with red to violaceous papules, plaques, or nodules that can mimic reactive and clonal skin disorders, all of which can be distinguished by pathologic review of a skin biopsy with morphologic evaluation and immunohistochemical stains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90908 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>This pathologic distinction is based upon three main factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying the infiltrate as clonal (not reactive), usually by demonstrating monotypic light chain restriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining that the neoplastic cells are of B cell origin (not T cell or NK cell), usually by demonstrating the presence of B cell antigens (eg, CD20) and lack of T cell antigens (eg, CD3).

(See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4224694\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive infiltrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to differentiate the neoplastic B cell infiltrate seen in primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (PCBCL) from reactive B cell infiltrates. Entities that can mimic cutaneous B cell lymphoma include cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia and cutaneous drug reactions (pseudolymphoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In general, PCBCLs will demonstrate monotypic light chain restriction while reactive processes are polyclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Both PCMZL and cutaneous B cell pseudolymphoma may develop from chronic antigenic stimulation by intradermally applied antigens (eg, tattoo pigments, tick bites, antigen injections). Both conditions may be manifestations of a continuous spectrum of cutaneous B cell proliferations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; as such, there has been debate over whether all cases currently classified as PCMZL should be considered overt malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with systemic B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) can develop cutaneous disease at some point in their illness. It is important to distinguish between patients with secondary cutaneous involvement by a systemic lymphoma and those with PCMZL since these entities have drastically different prognoses and management options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1212257987\"><span class=\"h3\">Marginal zone lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cutaneous involvement of systemic marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) may present with skin lesions that clinically and histologically resemble those of PCMZL. While there are some clinical and pathologic findings that favor one diagnosis over the other, systemic evaluation for disease outside of the skin is necessary to stage PCMZL and to definitively rule out extracutaneous disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cutaneous-follicle-center-lymphoma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>When compared with patients with PCMZL, patients with secondary skin involvement of MZL tend to be older, and have a distribution of lesions favoring the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Skin biopsies of MZL lesions demonstrate similar histology to other types of extranodal MZL, but rarely show colonization of follicular structures or lymphoepithelial lesions, and also differ in the expression of class-switching immunoglobulins and the composition of background inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/7,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39</a>]. While most noncutaneous MZLs express IgM, cases of PCMZL typically express IgG, IgA, or IgE. In addition, the inflammatory background in PCMZL most closely resembles that of a Th2 cytokine-influenced milieu whereas other extranodal MZL with secondary skin involvement have a Th1 cytokine inflammatory background. Colonization of follicular structures by neoplastic marginal zone cells, as often observed in extranodal MZL arising at other sites, is rarely seen in PCMZL.

Staining for CD5 and cyclin D1 may be useful to differentiate PCMZL (CD5-, cyclin D1-) from mantle cell lymphoma (CD5+, cyclin D1+) and skin localizations of small lymphocytic leukemia (CD5+, cyclin D1-).

The former disorder can often be differentiated from PCFCL based upon differences in clinical presentation and immunophenotypic findings on the skin biopsy. A hallmark of PCMZL is monotypic Ig light chain expression by the lymphoplasmacytoid and plasma cells that are typically located at the periphery of the nodular infiltrates and subepidermally; this is rarely observed in PCFCL. Furthermore, PCFCL is often characterized by a diffuse infiltrate of large cleaved cells (large centrocytes) that express BCL6, but not BCL2, and have variable expression of CD10. In contrast, the neoplastic cells of PCMZL express BCL2, but not BCL6 or CD10. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous T cell lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary cutaneous CD4+ <span class=\"nowrap\">small/medium</span> T cell lymphoma is an uncommon lymphoma that can morphologically resemble PCMZL and often has commingling B cells and light chain-restricted plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Unlike PCMZL, the medium-sized to large T cells in this entity express CD4, CXCL13, and PD-1. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas can usually be distinguished from cutaneous B cell lymphomas through their expression of T cell markers such as CD2, CD3, and CD5. In addition, cutaneous T cell lymphomas can be identified by T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies. This is discussed in more detail separately.

A radiation dose of 24 Gy is typically used and the treatment area should include a margin of healthy appearing tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

This approach aims to limit exposure to potentially toxic systemic agents given the indolent nature of these tumors.</p><p/><p>This approach is generally consistent with those proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma, International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>].

Six of 14 patients reported in the literature achieved a complete response. Treatment appeared to be most successful with cephalosporin therapy. For those with PCMZL, antibiotics should be reserved for those with evidence of <em>Borrelia</em> infection on serologic testing or upon testing of lesional skin. Pathogenetic links between PCMZL and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection have been established in Europe, but North American and Asian case series have thus far failed to demonstrate a similar relationship.

Restaging should consist of repeating laboratory and clinical examinations used to stage the disease at presentation. We typically do not perform a bone marrow biopsy unless there is suspicion of bone marrow involvement, such as an abnormal complete blood count. If the radiographic studies were normal at the time of diagnosis, we reserve repeat imaging for patients in whom there is a clinical concern for systemic spread based upon symptoms, laboratory results, or physical examination.</p><p>Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of complete remission (CR), patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician.</p><p>For patients who are in CR, we re-evaluate with a physical examination every three months for the first two years following therapy. The frequency of clinic visits is then decreased thereafter. We do not use imaging studies or blood examinations in the routine follow-up of asymptomatic individuals. This is principally because recurrences are almost always detected by clinical examination. In a retrospective analysis that included 14 patients with primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) followed for a median of 44 months, there were 12 episodes of recurrence, all of which were identified by physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

If they occur inside the radiation field, surgical excision or single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may be used.

Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) is a PCBCL and is also included in the broader category of extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no clearly defined risk factors for the development of PCMZL; however, an association between PCMZL and infectious agents, such as <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, has been postulated.

A typical biopsy of PCMZL demonstrates a clonal B cell infiltrate comprised of small to medium sized lymphocytes, often with a plasmacytoid appearance, which express monotypic Ig light chains. Reactive (nonclonal) germinal center-like structures may be present. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The staging evaluation both confirms the diagnosis by excluding involvement of other sites and provides information to guide treatment.
