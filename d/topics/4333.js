Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect bones to other bones. Symptoms of a finger sprain can include finger pain, swelling, stiffness, or weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexor tendon injury &ndash; Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. In a flexor tendon injury, a tendon on the palm side of the hand is torn or cut. If the cut or tear is near the tip of the finger, it keeps the finger tip from being able to bend. The fingertip stays straight. Doctors sometimes use the term &quot;jersey finger&quot; to describe this injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61721\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61721 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensor tendon injury &ndash; In this injury, a tendon on the back of the hand is torn or cut. If the tear or cut is near the tip of the finger, it causes the tip of the finger to stay bent. The finger is unable to straighten. One common type of extensor tendon injury is called &quot;mallet finger&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74506 \">picture 2</a>). This happens when the finger joint closest to the fingernail gets hurt. Besides making the fingertip bent, mallet finger causes pain and swelling on top of the joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another common type of extensor tendon injury is called a &quot;boutonniere deformity.&quot; This happens when the tendon tears and slips out of place. It makes the finger joint nearest the tip of the finger stay straight, and the finger joint in the middle of the finger stay bent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69947\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69947 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigger finger &ndash; This condition keeps a person's finger from straightening normally. When people try to straighten their finger, the finger &quot;locks&quot; or &quot;catches&quot; in a bent position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80186\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80186 \">picture 3</a>). Trigger finger can also cause pain in the finger or palm. Trigger finger is caused by a problem with a tendon.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27081957\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will probably do an X-ray of your finger or hand. He or she might also do an imaging test such as an ultrasound or CT or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27081972\"><span class=\"h1\">How are finger injuries treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of finger injury you have and how severe it is.</p><p>If you have a lot of pain or a severe injury, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your injury is mild, your doctor might recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>Treatments for your finger injury can include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your hand</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your hand raised above the level of your heart (when possible)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your finger &ndash; To reduce swelling, you can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. You should put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. You should use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing an elastic bandage (such as an ACE wrap)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buddy taping &ndash; Buddy taping involves taping your injured finger to the finger next to it. This is done most often to treat finger sprains. It is not done to treat tendon injuries or trigger finger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a splint &ndash; Splints are usually used to treat tendon injuries and trigger finger. For some of these injuries, such as mallet finger, people need to wear their splint at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Some people need surgery to fix a ligament or tendon. Hand surgery is usually done by a specialist called a hand surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; After your injury has healed, your doctor might recommend that you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she can teach you exercises to strengthen your fingers and help them move more easily.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27081987\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do finger injuries take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Finger injuries can take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of injury.</p><p>It also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal very quickly. Older adults or adults with other medical problems can take much longer to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27082002\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your finger injury is healing. For example, you might not be allowed to bend or straighten your finger for a certain amount of time. Your doctor might also recommend that you avoid certain activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27082017\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your fingers, or your fingers look blue or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You bent or straightened your finger, and you weren't supposed to bend or straighten it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27082032\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hand pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Finger fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-dislocation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Finger dislocation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenosynovitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tenosynovitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
