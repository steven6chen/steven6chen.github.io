(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> below.)</p><p>A broad range of conditions can result in special health care needs. Examples include problems such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, food allergy, sickle cell disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, genetic disorders, myelomeningocele, neuromuscular disease, epilepsy, congenital heart disease, trauma-related injury, and HIV, as well as disorders of speech, language, learning, and behavior.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of aspects of care that are relevant to all CYSHCN &ndash; regardless of their underlying condition.

Commercial insurance policies alone may have inadequate depth and breadth of coverage for services such as home health care, medical equipment, or additional therapies (eg, physical, occupational, speech therapies).

Providers can foster development of independence and self-advocacy by working and talking directly with the child or adolescent to identify goals and to promote as much autonomy as possible in medical care and decision making.</p><p>Pediatric health care providers can initiate prevocational counseling during early adolescence and encourage exploration of various careers through part-time jobs, volunteer work, or mentorship during the primary and secondary school years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Adolescents with special needs should be encouraged to take responsibility for self-care, budgeting an allowance, and household chores in addition to learning to manage any medications.</p><p>If possible, health care providers should facilitate connection with families of older CYSHCN (eg, through formal support and information organizations or informal connections among patient families). These connections can provide support for both families and allow the family of the younger child to benefit from the other family's positive and negative experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>Planning for transition should be part of the annual individualized education program (IEP) for all students who receive special education services between 14 years of age and graduation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The plan should include self-determination and leadership skills and consider the student's preferences for employment, community living, recreation, relationships, transportation, and community integration. Involvement of a multispecialty team is associated with a successful transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs/abstract/129\"

class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1993216617\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) are those who have or are at increased risk of developing a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that usually required by children. Children with medical complexity are a subset of CYSHCN; they have multiple chronic conditions often requiring the care of an array of community- and hospital-based providers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examples of special needs for CYSHCN include prescriptions; rehabilitative therapies; assistive devices; vision, hearing, or dental care; nutrition therapies; referrals for specialty medical services, educational services, or social services; behavioral or mental health care; and respite or hospice care. (See <a href=\"#H1964538229\" class=\"local\">'Types of special needs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a child with chronic illness affects family life, the wellbeing of family members, and family finances. (See <a href=\"#H2351363675\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial and economic consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;medical home&quot; model of care provides benefits for CYSHCN and their providers, including streamlined care, efficient use of resources, decreased out-of-pocket expenditures, expanded expertise and competence for the involved providers, establishment of a forum for problem solving, and improved satisfaction. (See <a href=\"#H923149025\" class=\"local\">'Medical home'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of patient- and family-centered care is a core principle of care in the medical home. Patient and family-centered care focuses on the individuality and personality of the child, family needs, and the concerns of health care and service providers with whom the child interacts. The family is a full and equal partner in shared decision making. (See <a href=\"#H738366555\" class=\"local\">'Patient- and family-centered care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of primary and preventive care for CYSHCN include routine health care maintenance (immunizations, screening, dental care, anticipatory guidance); assessment and referral as necessary (eg, for early intervention or special education services, rehabilitative services, home <span class=\"nowrap\">nursing/home</span> health aide services, behavior therapy, transportation); and support and advocacy. (See <a href=\"#H3912629453\" class=\"local\">'Primary and preventive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CYSHCN often require the care of multiple health professionals. Care coordination and integration are essential constructs within the medical home model, warranting special attention to care planning, team-based care, and supporting the family's goals. (See <a href=\"#H116111587\" class=\"local\">'Care coordination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transition to adult care providers, self-sufficiency, and financial independence requires advance planning and preparation. A number of resources are available to help health care providers, patients, and families address the transition to adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59408\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59408 \">table 4</a>).
