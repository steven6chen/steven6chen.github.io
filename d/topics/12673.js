This may be manifested by the presence of an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after initial definitive therapy or by the presence of metastases.</p><p>Contemporary research has led to the development of multiple active treatment modalities for men with advanced disease. Management of men with advanced prostate cancer involves the sequential use of these and older approaches, with the goals of prolonging survival, minimizing complications, and maintaining quality of life.</p><p>The initial approach to treatment for patients with disseminated prostate cancer includes the use of androgen deprivation therapy and is presented here. </p><p>Men who relapse after their initial systemic hormonal therapy are considered to have castration-resistant prostate cancer.

However, some men with prostate cancer have overt metastases either at presentation or as their first sign of recurrence following definitive therapy. In the vast majority of cases, such metastases are predominantly osteoblastic lesions in the axial skeleton.</p><p>Systemic therapy options for men in whom the only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated PSA are the same as those for men with overt metastases. However, the choice of initial systemic treatment should consider the extent of disease and associated symptomatology (eg, elevated serum PSA only, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease, or symptomatic disease). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909273508\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, prostate cancer that has not previously been treated with systemic therapy is dependent upon androgen for its continued growth. Androgen production occurs primarily in the testes, which account for 90 to 95 percent of total circulating testosterone; testicular production of androgen is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The adrenal glands produce the remainder of the circulating androgens.</p><p>These observations provide the rationale for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is a key component of initial therapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, and is also used in conjunction with other therapies for castration-resistant disease. ADT can be accomplished with either bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or medical orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-disseminated-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3785523\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3785523\"><span class=\"h1\">ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a component of the initial approach for patients when systemic therapy is indicated for metastatic prostate cancer or when evidence of disseminated disease is based upon an elevated or rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). ADT can be accomplished either with bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or medical orchiectomy.</p><p>Combining ADT with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> increases overall survival compared with ADT alone in patients with high-risk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> de novo presentation with metastases.

Following surgery, serum testosterone levels rapidly decrease to castrate levels. In many countries, bilateral orchiectomy remains the standard of care for initial hormone therapy of metastatic prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Surgical orchiectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical castration may be particularly useful when an immediate decrease in testosterone is necessary (eg, impending spinal cord compression, urinary tract outlet obstruction) or when cost or adherence to medical therapy are an issue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical orchiectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical orchiectomy decreases testicular production of testosterone through its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The most widely used approach is continuous treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which suppresses luteinizing hormone production and, therefore, the synthesis of testicular androgens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p>With the initiation of treatment with GnRH agonists, there is a transient surge of luteinizing hormone before the luteinizing hormone levels fall. This surge can cause an increase in serum testosterone, which may rarely result in a worsening of disease. This &quot;flare phenomenon&quot; may be of particular concern in clinical settings such as impending epidural spinal cord compression or urinary tract outflow obstruction. Antiandrogens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bicalutamide</a>) may be useful in preventing the flare phenomenon. (See <a href=\"#H2604139849\" class=\"local\">'Combined androgen blockade'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of GnRH agonists are available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buserelin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buserelin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a>). Depot formulations are frequently used to permit less-frequent treatment administration.

Degarelix suppresses testosterone production and avoids the flare phenomenon observed with GnRH agonists; a GnRH antagonist may be a useful alternative to a GnRH agonist when an immediate decrease in testosterone levels is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H2049410717\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'GnRH antagonists'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous versus intermittent ADT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the side effects of ADT are due to castrate levels of serum testosterone. When treatment is withdrawn, serum testosterone levels gradually return toward normal; discontinuation of long-acting GnRH agonists may be associated with a very slow testosterone recovery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H347807333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Serum testosterone level'</a>.)</p><p>Intermittent ADT has been proposed as a way to minimize the side effects of medical castration by withholding active therapy once patients have responded to treatment. ADT can then be reinstituted when there is evidence of progression. The time when men are off therapy may be associated with decreased side effects, thereby improving quality of life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic disease &ndash; Intermittent ADT is <strong>not</strong> indicated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer unless survival is considered secondary to quality of life, despite the theoretical advantages of this approach.

This is often manifested initially by an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients who are being closely followed for evidence of recurrence after definitive treatment. In other cases, overt metastatic disease may be present when the patient is first diagnosed or at some time after definitive treatment for locoregional disease. The same treatment options are generally used for men with overt metastases and those whose only evidence of disease is an elevated or rising serum PSA. (See <a href=\"#H261299175\" class=\"local\">'Extent of disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previously untreated prostate cancer generally is dependent upon androgen for its continued growth. This observation provides the basis for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as a component of the initial systemic therapy. Treatments targeting androgenic stimulation of the tumor are also used in several subsequent treatment modalities. (See <a href=\"#H909273508\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3785523\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend ADT with either medical or surgical orchiectomy as a component of the initial treatment to suppress serum testosterone levels for all patients requiring systemic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Other modalities that have been shown to prolong survival in men with castration-resistant disease are not indicated as monotherapy in this setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Surgical orchiectomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Medical orchiectomy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men whose only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated or rising PSA following definitive locoregional therapy, the optimal timing for initiation of ADT is problematic and involves a consideration of the prolonged natural history of the disease as well as patient-specific factors, including age and personal preferences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H81453304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Natural history after biochemical failure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-treatment-for-localized-prostate-cancer-systemic-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after treatment for localized prostate cancer: Systemic therapy&quot;, section on 'When to initiate ADT-based therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men with overt metastases, we suggest immediate rather than delayed treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This approach has been shown to significantly decrease prostate cancer-related deaths, but the difference in overall survival was not statistically significant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Timing of treatment initiation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with high-risk disseminated prostate cancer, we recommend that ADT be combined with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> rather than using ADT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The combination of ADT with either abiraterone or docetaxel significantly prolongs overall survival compared with ADT alone. However, these two approaches have not been directly compared, and the choice of regimen should include a discussion with the patient about the potential toxicities associated with each agent.
