Safety issues are therefore important aspects of the care of patients with dementia. Different safety concerns arise in a relatively predictable manner as dementia progresses. Addressing these issues proactively can prevent serious incidents.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the recognition and management of safety and societal issues related to dementia, including decision-making capacity, driving, financial capacity, cooking, wandering and becoming lost, falls, living alone, and voting. The management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and palliative care of patients with advanced dementia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care of patients with advanced dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pharmacologic treatment of memory and behavioral problems related to dementia is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262670089\"><span class=\"h1\">DECISION-MAKING CAPACITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any illness or treatment that compromises cognition may be associated with reduced capacity. The likelihood of diminished capacity is related to the severity of cognitive impairment, although brief measures of overall cognition such as the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) are not a substitute for an assessment of capacity. While low scores (eg, &lt;16 out of 30 points) in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer disease are highly correlated with impaired capacity, higher scores may or may not correlate with full capacity to make decisions.</p><p>Among patients with mild to moderate stage dementia, verbal reasoning and verbal memory are the two cognitive domains that explain most of the performance on measures of capacity to consent. Measures of an individual&rsquo;s insight into his or her memory problems also correlate with decision-making capacity.</p><p>These and other issues related to the assessment of decision-making capacity in adults with dementia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-decision-making-capacity-in-adults#H2075084837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurodegenerative disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-decision-making-capacity-in-adults#H125608120\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults&quot;, section on 'How to assess capacity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-decision-making-capacity-in-adults#H125608126\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults&quot;, section on 'How the capacity assessment informs clinical judgment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DRIVING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often the first safety issue to be confronted is driving. Discussions of driving cessation are challenging. Surrendering a license often represents a severe loss of independence. Patients are generally unaware of their deficits (particularly their deficits in judgment) and are not accurate assessors of their driving ability. With early diagnosis, many patients with mild dementia will still be able to drive safely for a period of time, but all will eventually progress to the point where it is no longer safe to drive.</p><p>In one survey, individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) in the first year after diagnosis had a similar rate of crashes as registered drivers of all ages (0.068 and 0.067 per year, respectively), although higher than age-matched controls (0.037) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risk of crashes rose in the following years, to 0.159 by year four. Other studies have been inconsistent in associating a higher rate of crashes with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One problem is that statistics of motor vehicle accidents may under-represent the risk since older patients substantially reduce their driving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, studies of driving evaluations consistently demonstrate worse performance in patients with dementia compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Impaired driving safety is associated with the degree of cognitive impairment as measured by neuropsychological test performance, in particular, measures of overall cognition as well as more specific measures of visual perception and motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As an example, in one prospective cohort study, older individuals who took more than 147 seconds to complete the Trails B test and those who took more than 352 ms on Useful Field of View subtest 2 were more than twice as likely to be involved in an at-fault motor vehicle accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of studies that evaluated predictors of driving capacity in persons with dementia found that the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53706 \">table 1</a>) had the best evidence of utility in evaluating driving safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Drivers with a CDR = 0 are in general safe to drive; patients with a CDR = 2 are considered unsafe to drive. Patients with a CDR of 0.5 or 1 have a higher risk of unsafe driving compared to those with a CDR = 0, but a substantial proportion (41 to 85 percent) will be judged to be safe drivers by an on-road driving evaluation.</p><p>Other predictors of unsafe driving have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is important to note that these are more helpful in identifying drivers at risk; their absence does not identify a safe driver. Predictors of unsafe driving include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent (one to five years) history of motor vehicle accident or citation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-restricted driving</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive or impulsive behaviors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregiver's assessment of marginal or unsafe driving</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 24 or less</p><p/><p>An American Academy of Neurology practice parameter suggests an algorithm for evaluating driving safety in patients with dementia based upon the clinical dementia rating (CDR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53706 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a CDR = 2 are at high risk for unsafe driving. Patients and families should be counselled to stop driving and interventions should be made pursuant to state guidelines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a CDR = 0.5 or 1 are at intermediate risk for unsafe driving. Considering this along with the other risk factors noted above, patients and families should be encouraged to develop alternative sources of transportation, to consider voluntary surrender of driving privileges, limiting driving to daylight hours, and to consider referral for a professional driving evaluation.</p><p/><p>Mandatory reporting of a moderate or severe dementia is required in some states in the US (eg, California, Pennsylvania) as well as certain provinces in Canada and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although a number of driving safety tests have been suggested, randomized studies have not been performed and no guidelines have been broadly implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Local programs may exist to evaluate these patients with neuropsychological and roadside tests. In the absence of these programs, the department of motor vehicles will often perform roadside testing, but patients must be informed that even if they pass they will need to be retested at regular intervals as their disease progresses. Families must be warned about potential liability for accidents. They may need to take possession of car keys, or even the cars, and restrict all driving.</p><p>Impaired cognition is only one factor limiting driving in older persons. Medications, sleep disorders, along with visual and motor impairments should also be considered in assessing driving safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-older-drivers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of older drivers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18644325\"><span class=\"h1\">FINANCIAL CAPACITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Financial capacity has been defined as the &ldquo;ability to independently manage one&rsquo;s financial affairs in a manner consistent with personal self-interest&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Impaired financial capacity can be the presenting clinical deficit in a patient with early dementia and can have serious consequences with the potential for financial mismanagement and vulnerability to scams and exploitation.</p><p>Because impaired financial capacity can occur early in the course of dementia and is inevitable in all patients, it should be addressed relatively early after diagnosis with the patient and family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Recommendations include execution of a durable power of attorney which can take effect immediately or in the future after impaired capacity has been demonstrated. Other practical interventions can include online banking, direct deposit, automatic bill-pay, joint bank accounts, over-draft protections, and the use of living trusts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>While certain neuropsychological tests can help assess financial capacity (eg, Financial Capacity Instrument) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], none of these instruments are well validated against financial outcomes or are likely to be, and none substitute for oversight from a trusted caregiver. When the latter is not available, a court-appointed conservator or guardian may need to be appointed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elder mistreatment: Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation&quot;, section on 'Guardianship'</a>.)</p><p>Patients and family can be referred to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association: <span class=\"nowrap\">http://www</span>.alz.org or 1-800-272-3900 for referrals regarding financial or legal planning. Other resources include the American Association of Retired persons (AARP) Money Management Program: <span class=\"nowrap\">http://www</span>.aarpmmp.org or 1-888-687-2277 (English) and 1-877-627-3350 (Spanish) and the National Council on Aging Benefits Check Up service: www.benefitscheckup.<span class=\"nowrap\">org/</span> or 1-202-479-1200.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another daily activity that can generate concern early in the disease is cooking. Distractibility, forgetfulness, or difficulty following directions could lead to injuries, burns, or fires. We recommend early use of microwave ovens, particularly if the patient is unfamiliar with their use and may require instruction. Learning to use a new device will be easier early in the disease process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WANDERING AND BECOMING LOST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Safety problems center around personal mobility in later stages of dementia. Distractibility and restlessness may lead to wandering. Signs on doors may reorient patients, and alarms may control movement. Regular supervised exercise can also lessen restlessness and the drive to wander. However, memory loss with spatial impairment can cause a wandering patient to get lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The issue of wandering and becoming lost, with the attendant potential for physical harm or death, is one of the concerns that often leads families and caregivers to place demented patients in nursing homes. Little research is available on the risk of becoming lost. However, a review of this issue that analyzed data from several available studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>] produced the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Who is at risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All persons with dementia are at risk of becoming lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk may be higher for demented men than for women.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals residing in professional care settings are at risk as well as those at home.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wandering is only a risk factor; individuals who had never wandered have become lost.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Situations involving risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of becoming lost is increased when demented persons are unattended, even in their own residences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, about 65 percent of people with dementia are in the presence of a caregiver at the time they become lost. Becoming lost appears to be a highly unpredictable event and can occur even when individuals with dementia are in their own homes or are engaged in activities they had routinely performed many times in the past without incident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals who are found alive remain out in the open in populated areas of the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk of death is increased if the demented person ends up secluded in natural or sparsely populated areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. About 91 percent of persons with dementia who died were found in natural areas such as woods, fields, ditches, bodies of water (nearly 22 percent drowned), or abandoned vehicles. The risk of death also appears to be associated with the hottest and coldest times of the year.</p><p>The time it took to search for and locate a missing person with dementia also correlated with the risk of death, as most individuals found alive were located within 24 hours, and all were found within four days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors impeding the search</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Locating a person with dementia who becomes lost can be difficult, and this problem is compounded by several factors related to the increased likelihood of abnormal behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with dementia often behave in an unpredictable manner when lost.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of the search is usually not enhanced by predictions from families and caregivers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lost persons rarely call for help or respond to searcher's calls.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effective search strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Search strategies should not be based on the individual characteristics of the missing person, since the unpredictable and abnormal behavior is likely to negate any prior individual patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregivers should report the person missing immediately to local authorities (and to Safe Return if registered).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intensive search should begin immediately, so that the individual has less time to find a secluded hiding place and has reduced exposure to the elements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Searches should continue through the night, as individuals often continue to wander.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial 6 to 12 hours of the search should cover a five mile radius around the location where the lost person was last seen, concentrating on open, populated areas, including the inside of easily accessible buildings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If initial search efforts fail, the subsequent efforts should be devoted to an intensive foot search of natural and sparsely populated areas beginning within a one mile radius of the last known location and extending from there.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the person with dementia traveled by automobile, initial search efforts should focus on locating the vehicle.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caregivers, both formal and informal, must be informed that all persons with dementia are at risk of becoming lost, even if the individual has never wandered or exhibited &quot;risky&quot; behavior in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Since the risk is highest when persons with dementia are left unattended, every effort should be made to ensure continuous supervision. Community resources, adult day care and respite care facilities, and caregiver support groups may be utilized, if available, to reduce the burden on families and caregivers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Safe Return</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Registration with Safe Return or similar programs is critical, as persons with dementia often cannot remember their address, phone number, or possibly even their name. Identification information can facilitate return if a patient is lost. The Alzheimer's Association administers the nationwide &quot;Safe Return&quot; program with identification bracelet, necklace, or clothing tags and 24-hour assistance. More information is available online at <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/Services/SafeReturn.asp&amp;token=0SM8TegfFRL7gaY+yqo9TPBIqYtTza52T4gLnrREcqUeKopGWq3AM7Hk2ymRWhcGVO9ldxad0YNmqly3YXJlFg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5080\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.alz.org/Services/SafeReturn.asp</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H944579933\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYPHARMACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypharmacy is very common in older adults, who may have multiple medical conditions and are at increased risk for adverse drug events due to metabolic changes and decreased drug clearance associated with aging. These risks are compounded by increasing numbers of drugs used. A diagnosis of dementia adds further vulnerability, not only to cognitive side effects but also to effects of drugs on balance, motor function, and bladder control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Adverse drug events'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the total number of medications prescribed, drugs of particular concern in older adults with dementia include anticholinergic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100289 \">table 2</a>), benzodiazepines, opioids, antipsychotic drugs, and antihypertensive drugs, especially in patients with Parkinson disease and other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Inappropriate medications'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these risks, data suggest that older adults with dementia are commonly prescribed potentially unsafe medications. In analysis of United States medication expenditures between 2005 and 2009, 23 percent of community-dwelling persons &gt;65 years with dementia were prescribed medications with clinically significant anticholinergic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another large study that included over 75,000 adults with dementia in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system, 44 percent of patients were prescribed at least one potentially unsafe medication (mostly drugs with high anticholinergic activity), and rates were consistently higher among patients receiving care from multiple providers (inside and outside the VA system) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Patients with dementia are also at risk for prescribing cascades, which occur when a new drug is prescribed to treat symptoms arising from an unrecognized side effect of an existing therapy. One common example relevant to patients with dementia is prescription of an anticholinergic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxybutynin</a>) to treat incontinence that develops after prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Prescribing cascades'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic approach to improving prescribing practices in older adults is reviewed separately. Important components include periodic review of the patient&rsquo;s drug regimen, use of the minimal dose required to obtain clinical benefit, discontinuation of unnecessary therapies, consideration of adverse drug effects as a cause of a new symptom before prescribing another drug, and consideration of nonpharmacologic approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'A stepwise approach to prescribing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FALLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls are a major safety problem in some dementing illnesses, even early in the disease. The possibility of a parkinsonian syndrome should be considered if patients fall early in the course of illness; progressive supranuclear palsy, in particular, often presents with rigidity, poor postural reflexes, and frequent unprotected falls, in addition to the characteristic vertical gaze deficits.</p><p>Falls eventually become a problem in all dementias. In one study of 1608 Swedish persons above the age of 75, the risk of hip fracture was twice as high when the score on the Mini-Mental State Examination was suggestive of cognitive impairment (score 18 to 23) compared with those who had no impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Mini-Mental State Examination'</a>). Patients who fall require careful evaluation to determine the etiology, with special attention to the possibility of a myelopathy (from cervical spondylosis or vitamin B12 deficiency), a peripheral neuropathy, or visual impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the patient's safety, occasionally aggressive and even assaultive behavior can endanger a caregiver. The caregiver is often too embarrassed to mention this, if the practitioner does not specifically ask. In one case series, more than one-third of caregivers reported either psychological or physical abuse from the patient over the prior three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Caregivers can also become so frustrated with the constant vigilance required for care of the demented patient that they may verbally or physically abuse the patient. In either case, health care practitioners are mandated reporters and should notify elderly protection services.</p><p>The management of aggression in patients with dementia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVING ALONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living alone presents additional risks for people with cognitive impairment and dementia, as self-neglect, disorientation, and poor judgment may go unrecognized and unreported until there is a major problem or crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, few data exist regarding this population. The lack of data is exacerbated by the symptoms of cognitive impairment, which may cause this population to become disconnected from family, friends, and the healthcare system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Identifying risk factors for harm in patients with dementia who live alone is an important goal. This problem was addressed by a prospective cohort study of 139 patients aged 65 or older with cognitive impairments who lived alone and were followed for 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Harm was defined as an episode of physical injury to self or others, or property loss or damage due to self-neglect or disorientation, resulting in need for emergency services. Four variables were significantly predictive of harm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self perception of fewer social resources</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorer performance on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of cerebrovascular disease</p><p/><p>Over the course of 18 months, 30 (22 percent) of the participants had an incident of harm; the most frequent was failure to eat and drink in nine cases. Only one incident of smoke damage and no incidents of wandering occurred, perhaps due to the small population size and relatively short period of follow-up. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the results of this investigation and to provide physicians with reliable predictors of harm for patients with cognitive impairments who live alone.</p><p>If a clinician has reason to believe that a patient is in a state of self-neglect, appropriate reporting should be promptly initiated. Adult protective services agencies and the courts are obliged to use the least-restrictive alternative when an individual&rsquo;s autonomy is impacted in order to protect that person. Recognition and management of elder mistreatment, which includes self-neglect, is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elder mistreatment: Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">VOTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of voting by people with cognitive impairment or dementia presents multiple problems related to the integrity of the electoral process, individual autonomy, and voter rights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This issue is likely to grow in magnitude, as both voting rates and dementia prevalence are highest in the elderly.</p><p>While the few data that exist suggest that voting rates decline among people with advanced dementia, many continue to vote. As an example, in a study that surveyed 100 outpatients with dementia after the November 2000 US presidential election, 60 percent of respondents voted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Increasing severity of dementia was associated with reduced knowledge about the election and reduced voting participation by patients and caregivers. Voting rates for those with mild, moderate, and severe dementia were 77 versus 37 versus 18 percent, respectively.</p><p>In the United States, mental incapacity or incompetence is recognized as a valid reason for disenfranchisement of individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia at both the federal and state level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, there is currently no uniform regulation or standard used to define mental incapacity or incompetence in regard to voting.</p><p>One proposed standard defines the capacity to vote as having the ability to understand the nature and effect of voting and the capacity to choose among the candidates and questions on the ballot. Uniform state laws incorporating this test of competence have been advocated as a constitutionally appropriate model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Critics of a uniform standard have voiced concern over any approach that might rely on a test of competency. Some suggest an alternate approach, which would address the issue of voting competence during legal hearings that determine guardianship because of mental incapacity.</p><p>Individuals may retain the capacity to vote in the early stages of dementia but may require assistance from caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The practical effect of the need for assistance is that caregivers may end up serving a screening role in deciding competence and providing access to voting. Similar to the situation with legal standards, there is no single reliable instrument available to physicians or caregivers to assess the capacity to vote.</p><p>Current voting practice in the United States includes provisions such as secret balloting designed to reduce the risk of coercion. However, these provisions may be an impediment to caregiver assistance with voting. On the other hand, use of methods such as absentee ballots permits maximal assistance but raise concerns of voting fraud. As an example, some argue that it is not appropriate for family or other caregivers to vote by proxy on behalf of the person with dementia, even if they have legal authority to make decisions by proxy for other medical and legal matters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Further study is needed to develop standardized methods that can provide guidance in assessing the capacity to vote. Permissible forms of assistance that do not encourage abuse are also needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136087\"><span class=\"h1\">END OF LIFE ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the terminal stages of dementia, patients and their caregivers are faced with a range of physical and psychosocial needs, and effective palliative care can improve patients&rsquo; symptoms, lessen caregiver burden, and help ensure that treatment decisions are well informed and weighed in the context of patient and family goals and needs. Aspects of palliative care that are specific to patients with advanced dementia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care of patients with advanced dementia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caregivers of patients with dementia can suffer significant stress, particularly as cognitive function declines or behavioral symptoms worsen. Respite care and support groups may be of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/safety-and-societal-issues-related-to-dementia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and are available in most areas, often through the local agency on aging.

Addressing these issues proactively can prevent serious incidents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The capacity to make one&rsquo;s own decisions is fundamental to the ethical principle of respect for autonomy and a key component of informed consent to medical treatment. In the presence of cognitive impairment, determining whether a patient has adequate capacity is critical to striking the proper balance between respecting patient autonomy and acting in a patient&rsquo;s best interest. Brief tests of cognition in patients with dementia are not a substitute for a formal assessment of capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-decision-making-capacity-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Driving becomes progressively less safe as cognition deteriorates. An American Academy of Neurology practice parameter outlines recommendations for counseling patients and families regarding driving safety based upon the Clinical Dementia Rating. Patients with a CDR &ge;2 are considered unsafe to drive. Patients with a CDR = 0.5 or 1 should undergo further risk assessment, based upon identified risk factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an on-road driving evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Driving'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired financial capacity can be the presenting clinical deficit in a patient with early dementia and can have serious adverse consequences. This impairment should be addressed with patients and families early on after diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H18644325\" class=\"local\">'Financial capacity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with dementia wander and may become lost, with an attendant risk of personal harm and even death. This can occur when a patient lives at home and when residing in a professional care center. Supervision, identification tags, and registration with Safe Return or similar programs may ameliorate risk. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Wandering and becoming lost'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polypharmacy is common in older adults, and older adults with dementia are at heightened risk for adverse drugs effects from anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines, and opioids, among many others. Medications lists should be reviewed periodically for necessity, and new drugs should be prescribed with caution. (See <a href=\"#H944579933\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls eventually become a problem in all dementias, but can be a problem early on in the dementias that are associated with parkinsonism (eg, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease dementia). Patients and families should be asked about falling, which may be an indication for providing increased supervision. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Falls'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive behavior may present a risk to the caregiver as well as to the patient. Caregivers may be embarrassed to volunteer this problem; and this history should be solicited. The treatment of aggressive behavior is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living alone presents risks for people with cognitive impairment and dementia, as self-neglect, disorientation, and poor judgment present potential for harm and injury. Family members are useful allies in assessing when this situation becomes unsafe. In the absence of family or other caregivers, home safety evaluations through a professional nursing service may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Living alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative and hospice care can benefit patients with severe dementia at the end of their lives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care of patients with advanced dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregivers of patients with dementia can suffer significant stress, particularly as cognitive function declines or behavioral symptoms worsen.
