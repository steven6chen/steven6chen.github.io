Beginning with World War I, surgeons noted lower mortality among soldiers with penetrating abdominal wounds who were managed with laparotomy. Ultimately, laparotomy became the mandatory treatment for such wounds. It gradually became clear that penetrating abdominal trauma sustained during warfare (mostly higher velocity gunshot wounds and incendiary devices) was different than penetrating abdominal trauma sustained by civilians (mostly stab wounds and lower velocity gunshot wounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 1960, Shaftan questioned the dogma of mandatory laparotomy for all penetrating abdominal injuries, and laparotomy rates for abdominal stab wounds have declined steadily over the ensuing decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults. General trauma resuscitation in adults and children, blunt abdominal trauma, abdominal gunshot wounds, and other aspects of trauma care are reviewed separately.

Abdominal gunshot wounds, due to their higher kinetic energy, are associated with mortality rates approximately eight times higher than abdominal stab wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In children and adults alike, hollow viscus organs (intestines) are injured most often with abdominal stab wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. The next most common sites of injury are the great vessels, diaphragm, mesentery, spleen, liver, kidney, pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands. The specific organs at greatest risk from a stab wound depend upon the location of the injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any instrument that can impale may inflict a stab wound. Typically these are narrow, sharp, knife-like implements, but items that can inflict stab wounds range from scissors to coat hangers to animal horns. The given instrument can injure any tissue it traverses, including skin, fascia, solid organ, hollow viscus, blood vessel, nerve, muscle, and bone.</p><p>According to one series, the majority of abdominal stab wounds with evisceration occurred in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, followed by the left lower, the right upper, and the right lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Posterior (ie, back) and flank stab wounds have a greater risk of injury to retroperitoneal structures, including the colon, kidneys, and adrenals. Multiple stab wounds are present in 18 to 34 percent of patients, and as many as 30 percent of penetrating chest injuries may traverse the diaphragm, potentially harming abdominal tissues and organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Accordingly, anterior stab wounds that are inferior to the nipple line (fourth intercostal space) and posterior stab wounds that are inferior to the tip of the scapula (seventh intercostal space) should be considered to involve potential diaphragm and intra-abdominal injuries in addition to chest injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-diaphragmatic-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of diaphragmatic injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC ZONES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal cavity is divided into four anatomic zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64644 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51176 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72219 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79068 \">figure 5</a>). The <strong>anterior abdomen</strong> is bound by the anterior axillary lines extending from the costal margins to the groin creases. Due to diaphragmatic excursion while breathing, the nipple line (fourth intercostal space) anteriorly, and the tips of the scapulae (seventh intercostal space) and the inferior costal margin posteriorly, should be used to define the cephalad portion of the abdomen. Wounds in the upper abdominal region pose a significant threat of injury to the chest and abdomen depending upon the path of the weapon and the position of the diaphragm at the time of injury.</p><p>The <strong>flanks</strong> are separated on each side by the inferior costal margins and iliac crests, and the anterior and posterior axillary lines. The <strong>back</strong> is defined as the area between the posterior axillary lines, the inferior scapular tips (seventh intercostal space), and the iliac crest. Back and flank stab wounds have a greater risk of injury to retroperitoneal structures, including the colon, kidneys, and adrenals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Answers to the following questions help to guide the clinician in assessing potential injuries from abdominal stab wounds:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What instrument was used?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long and how wide was the instrument?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How was the patient positioned during the stabbing?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What path (or paths in the event of multiple wounds) did the implement travel?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was there substantial blood loss at the scene?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General evaluation and the initial management of the trauma patient is reviewed separately. Issues specifically related to the initial evaluation of adult patients with stab wounds are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.) An algorithm to help guide the management of patients with an anterior abdominal stab wounds is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108065\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108065 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>It is important to completely undress any patient who sustains a stab wound. Stab wounds can often be obscured by body habitus, clothing, or bleeding, or be &quot;hidden&quot; in the axilla, scalp, perineum, or groin. Examine the patient carefully for evidence of more than one stab wound. Clinicians should be wary of lacerations reported to be, or that appear to be, from blunt trauma; such wounds may represent penetrating trauma associated with significant internal injury.</p><p>The options for assessment and management of patients with abdominal stab wounds are determined by their clinical presentation. Patients presenting in extremis may require resuscitative thoracotomy and emergent laparotomy to control hemorrhage or manage other injuries. Emergency thoracotomy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H4933905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resuscitative thoracotomy: Technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with any of the following typically go immediately to the operating theater for laparotomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impalement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evisceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frank blood from a nasogastric tube or on rectal examination</p><p/><p>In patients without apparent indications for immediate laparotomy, physical examination is both sensitive and specific for detecting significant intra-abdominal injury. A prospective observational study involving 249 consecutive abdominal stab wound patients treated at a major trauma center found physical examination to be 100 percent sensitive and 98.7 percent specific compared with CT for detecting intra-abdominal injury necessitating laparotomy, and concluded that a physical examination based diagnostic algorithm was effective and decreased radiation exposure for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients without apparent indications for laparotomy may be evaluated by one or more of the following techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local wound exploration (LWE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial physical examinations (SPE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27133174\"><span class=\"h2\">Local wound exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the entire abdominal wall is encased in a layer of fascia, the first question in asymptomatic patients is to determine whether the stab wound violated the peritoneum. Stab wounds are amenable to local wound exploration (LWE) to evaluate their depth and tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. LWE is safely performed at the bedside in patients with stab wounds to the anterior abdomen, but requires appropriate patient sedation and local anesthesia. The procedure, best undertaken by two individuals, should be done with sterile technique, good lighting and both sharp and blunt dissection until the bottom of the wound is clearly visualized. Blunt probing with fingers or cotton swabs is unreliable and not recommended. Adequate analgesia and appropriate sedation must be provided when performing LWE. In some cases, local infiltration of tissues with anesthetic is sufficient, but standard procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is required in other cases. The performance of PSA is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For anterior stab wounds, if the exploration to the deepest extent of the wound demonstrates that anterior rectus fascia is not violated, then patients may be discharged after appropriate wound care, assuming no additional or extra-abdominal injuries are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Obesity, heavy muscle, or the presence of multiple wounds or other injuries can compromise LWE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. If the anterior fascia is not clearly and completely seen, peritoneal injury cannot be ruled out and further evaluation is required. For clinicians with limited experience performing LWE, or those who have not performed one in some time, the safest policy is to presume peritoneal violation unless all edges of the wound are visualized clearly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87309229\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs typically add little to the management of abdominal stab wounds. If free intraperitoneal air is seen on an upright chest or lateral decubitus radiograph, then the peritoneal cavity has been violated, but this does not confirm hollow viscus injury. Thus, plain radiographs lack sensitivity and specificity for significant injuries and are rarely employed in this setting.</p><p>An exception is the use of plain radiographs to evaluate foreign bodies. These include cases of impalement where the foreign object remains in the patient and cases where there is concern for a retained foreign body not visible in the wound, such as a broken knife blade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87309482\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial physical examination and observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is well accepted that serial physical examination (SPE) is a safe and reliable means to detect significant intra-abdominal injuries after stab wounds to the abdomen, if performed by experienced clinicians on appropriate patients. Ideally, the same clinician should perform each examination.</p><p>Patients not appropriate for SPE include those with an unreliable examination due to head injury, spinal cord injury, altered mental status (eg, from intoxication), or the need for anesthesia. In addition to careful reassessment of the abdomen, the physical examination should include assessment of the neurologic and vascular status of the lower extremities as stab wounds may damage nerves and vessels in the abdomen and pelvis. Ideally, serial examinations are performed at least every six hours.</p><p>The requisite duration of observation after a stab wound to the abdomen that penetrates the anterior rectus fascia is at least 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients in the following categories should be observed for at least 24 hours:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older than 65 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications at the time of injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have significant medical comorbidities that may affect detection of internal injury (eg, diabetes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have other significant injuries warranting observation</p><p/><p>Mildly intoxicated patients should be observed until the effects of the intoxicating substance have resolved. Assuming no signs of significant injury are detected, such patients may be discharged following a final reassessment and reexamination.</p><p>Some basic criteria that the patient with an abdominal stab wound should meet to be considered appropriate for discharge after brief observation (12 hours) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mentally capable of making appropriate, informed decisions about medical care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; including careful abdominal examination &ndash; is unremarkable, with the lone exception of some reasonable discomfort at the stab wound site only</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs stable and without concerning trends (eg, heart rate has not risen from 55 to 89): Heart rate less than 90; respiratory rate less than <span class=\"nowrap\">14/minute;</span> temperature less than 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous urination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tolerating oral fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Able to ambulate safely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not taking anticoagulants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safe discharge environment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4647168\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedside extended Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (eFAST) examination is frequently used to determine the presence of hemopericardium, hemoperitoneum, pneumo- or hemothorax, or some combination thereof. Overall, the specificity of the FAST examination for identifying signs of internal injury from a stab wound appears to be high, but sensitivity is limited. The use of ultrasound (US) in evaluating patients with abdominal trauma is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The eFAST examination is particularly valuable in the initial assessment of a patient with a low chest or upper abdominal stab wound who is hemodynamically unstable, as rapid identification of hemopericardium or hemoperitoneum can help to determine the priorities of management. Hemopericardium causing hemodynamic compromise (ie, pericardial tamponade) must be drained immediately. Unstable patients with hemoperitoneum and no sign of hemopericardium or another immediately treatable cause of hypotension (eg, pneumothorax) should proceed to immediate laparotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H6092649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Pericardial tamponade'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-pericardiocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency pericardiocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'General approach and indications for laparotomy'</a> below.)</p><p>In hemodynamically stable patients with a positive eFAST, other diagnostic modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or diagnostic laparoscopy, can identify specific injuries and guide management. In those with a negative eFAST, injury cannot be excluded and other diagnostic modalities must be employed.</p><p>Other applications of US in penetrating abdominal trauma continue to evolve. While it is not routinely used to diagnose peritoneal penetration, a small preliminary study using the US transducer to assess fascial violation deep to the stab wound demonstrated excellent specificity but suboptimal sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic peritoneal tap and diagnostic peritoneal lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although invasive, diagnostic peritoneal tap and lavage is a rapid and easily performed bedside procedure that offers information about peritoneal penetration and injury to solid organs, bowel, and the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) does not assess the retroperitoneum. The procedure entails inserting a catheter into the peritoneal cavity, initially to aspirate blood or fluid, and subsequently to infuse fluid and lavage the cavity, if necessary. The initial portion of the procedure is often referred to as a diagnostic peritoneal tap or aspirate; the latter portion is a DPL.</p><p>In the setting of abdominal stab wounds, diagnostic peritoneal tap and lavage is generally used for one of the following indications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to rapidly determine the presence of hemoperitoneum in unstable patients when ultrasound is not diagnostic </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to diagnose diaphragm injury (eg, unclear if a stab wound to the lower chest has penetrated the peritoneum)</p><p/><p>The only absolute contraindication to DPL is the presence of a clear indication for immediate laparotomy. </p><p>In the hemodynamically unstable patient, DPL has been used to identify hemoperitoneum when the physical examination is equivocal or ultrasound is technically inadequate. DPL may be particularly important for guiding management in the patient with multiple stab wounds and other potential causes for hypotension, such as hemothorax, pericardial tamponade, spinal cord injury, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage.</p><p>In patients with stab wounds of the anterior abdomen who are hemodynamically stable and without indications for immediate laparotomy, the clinician should determine whether peritoneal violation has occurred. If the peritoneum has been violated or the clinician is uncertain whether it has, serial physical examination is the most cost effective means of assessing for significant intraperitoneal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. DPL may be a useful procedure when intraperitoneal injury must be assessed in patients who will become difficult to reevaluate, such as the patient who will be under general anesthesia for a procedure other than laparotomy. However, in most circumstances ultrasound or CT scan is used to evaluate stable patients rather than DPL.</p><p>Although previous abdominal surgery has been considered by some to be a potential cause of complications (eg, catheter malplacement, fluid sequestration, bowel perforation), according to a retrospective review the accuracy and complication rate of DPL in patients with previous abdominal surgery are similar to those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Consequently, previous abdominal surgery should be considered a relative contraindication to DPL and the decision to proceed in such cases should be made based on clinical judgment of, or in consultation with, the trauma surgeon. Other relative contraindications include preexisting coagulopathy, advanced cirrhosis, morbid obesity, and pregnancy beyond the first trimester. The supraumbilical approach to the DPL is advised in patients with a pelvic fracture or females beyond the first trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>We and most experts agree that the aspiration of 10 mL of gross blood in a patient with penetrating abdominal wounds indicates visceral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, debate continues over the appropriate red blood cell count threshold for determining visceral injury if the initial aspirate is negative or inconclusive and lavage is performed. A commonly used threshold is the presence of greater than 10,000 red blood cells per high-powered field <span class=\"nowrap\">(RBCs/HPF)</span>. A range of 5000 to 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">RBCs/HPF</span> is often used to determine the presence of injury in thoracoabdominal (low chest) wounds, as this lowered threshold allows greater sensitivity for detecting isolated diaphragmatic or small bowel injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. This degree of RBC concentration in the DPL effluent should not be attributed to the procedure itself. We believe these are reasonable thresholds to use.</p><p>Not all trauma surgeons agree with these thresholds, and several alternative approaches have been proposed, including higher thresholds that result in lower rates of nontherapeutic laparotomy but may lead to delays in diagnosis. Undoubtedly, approaches will vary by institution and available resources. Emergency clinicians performing a DPL should interpret the results in the context of the clinical scenario and in close consultation with the trauma surgeons, who must ultimately decide whether laparotomy is necessary. In patients selected for initial nonoperative management, DPL may be best employed in combination with serial physical examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/13,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,21</a>].</p><p>Studies supporting alternative thresholds for determining a positive DPL include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study performed at a single level one trauma center reported that of 280 patients with an abdominal stab wound who had a negative DPL only 15 (5 percent) went on to have a therapeutic laparotomy within 24 hours of admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

An algorithm to help guide the management of patients with an anterior abdominal stab wounds is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108065\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108065 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>After necessary resuscitation, patients with any of the following typically go immediately to the operating theater for laparotomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impalement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evisceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frank blood from a nasogastric tube or on rectal examination</p><p/><p>In the remaining patients, the first management decision is whether there is violation of the peritoneum or retroperitoneum. For anterior abdominal stab wounds, peritoneal penetration is the key decision point. This can often be determined by local wound exploration (LWE), but advanced imaging studies are sensitive and specific when necessary. Omental or visceral evisceration represents peritoneal violation and most believe this warrants laparotomy because of the high risk of gastrointestinal perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For flank and back wounds, there is a risk of retroperitoneal as well as peritoneal penetration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51176 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, there is concern for peritoneal violation with anterior lower thoracic stab wounds, and retroperitoneum injury with lower posterior chest wounds. Hemodynamically stable patients with these potentially more complex wounds (flank, back, thoracoabdominal) warrant careful evaluation, often including CT imaging and a period of observation. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Flank and back stab wounds'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Thoracoabdominal stab wounds'</a> below and <a href=\"#H87309924\" class=\"local\">'Right upper quadrant stab wound'</a> below.)</p><p>Signs of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (eg, hematemesis, hematochezia) suggest gastroduodenal or colorectal injury and generally warrant laparotomy without further investigation by imaging study. An implement in situ (ie, a weapon protruding from the patient's body) ordinarily prompts laparotomy, even in stable patients, in case the implement rests inside an intraperitoneal vessel, such that removal would lead to hemorrhage. Therefore, high risk surgical candidates and pregnant patients, for whom laparotomy puts the fetus at risk, may undergo removal of the implement without general anesthesia but in the operating suite in case they deteriorate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal violation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritoneal violation occurs in up to 50 to 70 percent of abdominal stab wounds, but only half of those with peritoneal violation sustain an intra-abdominal injury requiring operative intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, only 25 to 33 percent of patients with abdominal stab wounds require laparotomy. In most major trauma centers, local wound exploration (LWE) is performed to determine peritoneal penetration for anterior abdominal stab wounds. If no violation of the anterior rectus fascia has occurred, the patient may be discharged safely after local wound care, assuming there are no other injuries of concern. (See <a href=\"#H27133174\" class=\"local\">'Local wound exploration'</a> above.)</p><p>In centers without extensive experience with abdominal stab wounds, the alternative tests to evaluate for peritoneal penetration are DPL or CT scanning. Patients with a negative DPL or CT scan require at least another 12 hours of observation because of the risk of missing a gastrointestinal perforation or, in the case of DPL, the risk of intestinal injury due to the procedure.

There is no single best answer to this question and the decision will vary depending upon such factors as patient characteristics (eg, major comorbidities, advanced age) and distance from the closest hospital capable of providing definitive care. In general, we believe it is reasonable in most cases to keep such patients at a resource-limited facility for observation, even if LWE cannot be performed or is equivocal and CT cannot be obtained or is negative initially. Should the patient begin to manifest signs of intra-abdominal injury (eg, worsening abdominal pain) or vital signs show a concerning trend (eg, increase in heart rate or respiratory rate, decline in blood pressure), the patient should be transferred immediately. One exception to this general approach would be if the time needed to reach definitive care is prolonged (longer than approximately six hours) due to distance or weather. In such cases, it makes sense to transfer the patient early.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Flank and back stab wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying structures injured from penetrating wounds to the flank and back can be difficult. Stab wounds to these regions can injure both retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal structures. Several reports indicate that up to 40 percent of penetrating flank wounds result in significant internal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/8,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,40</a>]. Triple contrast CT (3CT) has been the diagnostic modality of choice for stable patients with such wounds, but with advanced, high-resolution, multidetector CT scanners, rectal contrast alone may be needed to assess possible retroperitoneal injury from back or flank wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/8,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,40,41</a>].

If the wound is close to the lower chest, intrathoracic and diaphragmatic injuries must be considered and evaluated in addition to intra-abdominal injury. Pericardial tamponade is particularly important to consider in stab wounds near the xyphoid process.</p><p>The morbidity and mortality associated with missed diaphragmatic injury on the left side is high (the liver generally prevents small bowel herniation on the right side). However, controversy continues about how best to evaluate possible diaphragm injuries. If diaphragmatic injury is a concern, diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) or thoracoscopy are the preferred tests because CT scanning is relatively insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults/abstract/21,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,43</a>].

Most patients with injuries of this nature have sustained grade I or grade II hepatic injuries that do not require operative intervention. However, these patients should be admitted for a period of observation of at least 48 hours. Many centers perform CT scanning to confirm and determine the extent of any hepatic wounds and to assess for potential colonic injury. If the severity of liver injury cannot be determined with certainty by CT scan, most trauma surgeons perform diagnostic laparoscopy. The physical examination cannot be considered reliable in patients with a brain injury, spinal cord injury, heavy intoxication, or who require sedation or anesthesia, and serial physical examination is not an appropriate means of evaluation in these circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1006942104\"><span class=\"h2\">Stab wounds in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal stab wounds sustained during pregnancy are uncommon.

Important questions include: what instrument was used, how long and how wide it was, how the patient was positioned during the stabbing, what path the implement traveled, and whether there was substantial blood at the scene. Undress completely any patient who sustains a stab wound. Stab wounds can often be obscured by body habitus, clothing, or bleeding, or be &quot;hidden&quot; in the axilla, scalp, or groin.

If a properly performed exploration to the deepest extent of the wound demonstrates that anterior rectus fascia is not violated, the patient may be discharged after appropriate wound care, assuming no additional or extra-abdominal injuries are present. If body habitus, multiple wounds, other injuries, or difficulty in performing LWE impedes visualization of the complete depth of the wound and all its margins, then peritoneal injury cannot be ruled out and further testing or observation must ensue.

Ideally, serial examinations should be performed by the same clinicians. The optimal time period for observation of uncomplicated stab wound patients in a nonoperative management plan is at least 12 hours.
