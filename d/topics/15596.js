However, many other factors (ie, fever, drugs, anxiety) influence heart rate. Although trends in response to treatment should be carefully monitored, specific target goals for heart rate are difficult to define and may <strong>not</strong> be useful.

(See <a href=\"#H3669730948\" class=\"local\">'Red flag findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Blood lactate can be obtained by bedside testing. Limited evidence suggests that serum lactate that decreases with treatment is associated with better outcomes for children with sepsis. In our practice, our therapeutic target is &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. Small observational studies in children have demonstrated that lactate can correlate with severity of shock and prognosis in sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

When measuring ScvO<sub>2</sub> in pediatric patients, pulmonary artery catheters are rarely used. Instead, changes in ScvO<sub>2</sub> are more commonly obtained from a catheter with its tip in the distal superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Identifying physiologic indicators to monitor the effectiveness of resuscitation for children with septic shock is challenging. Noninvasive ultrasonic determination of cardiac index, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and stroke volume is feasible in healthy children, and age-based normative values have been published. Although not widely available, bedside Doppler ultrasound shows promise as a noninvasive method to guide vasoactive therapy by calculating cardiac output and SVR from measurements of blood flow over the pulmonary artery or aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Physiologic indicators and target goals'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the method used to measure vascular pressures, clinical signs of end-organ perfusion must also be monitored in order to accurately determine the severity of shock and response to treatment. These indicators can be readily monitored noninvasively during the initial management of shock and, since many children in shock respond well, invasive monitoring can often be avoided. Mean arterial pressure can be measured with a blood pressure cuff.

The major goal for the initial treatment of septic shock consists of rapid fluid resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion based upon clinical therapeutic endpoints (eg, improvement of quality of pulses, capillary refill time, mental status, urine output). The specific goals identified for each endpoint is discussed above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113240\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113240 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>].

Fluid resuscitation begins with 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution. Infusion of this amount of fluid over 5 minutes can be achieved with a manual &quot;push-pull&quot; technique or rapid infuser. After the initial infusion, the child should be quickly reassessed for signs of inadequate end-organ perfusion to determine if additional fluid is needed and to identify any signs of fluid overload (eg, pulmonary rales or gallop rhythm). (See <a href=\"#H3669730948\" class=\"local\">'Red flag findings'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children#H22060512\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Risks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical and hemodynamic response and the presence or absence of volume overload must be assessed before and after each bolus. Experience suggests that patients with septic shock often require volumes of up to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in the first hour and some receive 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> or more during the first several hours of fluid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Use of a time clock has facilitated the timely administration of fluids in at least one setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fluid resuscitation should continue until tissue perfusion, oxygen delivery, and blood pressure are adequate, or signs of fluid overload (rales, gallop rhythm, enlarged liver) develop. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ideally within the first hour of treatment, the physician should determine if the patient is responding to timely fluid administration or not. Patients who are fluid-refractory (ie, no improvement or worsening despite appropriate fluid resuscitation) should begin inotropic therapy tailored to blood pressure and whether cold or warm shock is present. (See <a href=\"#H19450213\" class=\"local\">'Patients with fluid-refractory shock'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Observational studies from tertiary care pediatric facilities have documented high compliance (95 to 100 percent) with a one-hour fluid administration target after implementation of institutional bundles for rapid recognition and treatment of septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/4,5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,17</a>]. Achievement of targets for timely fluid resuscitation and antibiotic administration has been associated with reduction in mortality without negative impact on resource utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. However, despite institution-wide focus on the treatment of septic shock in these studies, the fluid resuscitation goal is not always met, even in these highly-resourced settings. The feasibility of a one-hour target for fluid resuscitation has not been addressed outside of tertiary care pediatric institutions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased attention to rapid recognition, aggressive fluid administration, and early administration of vasoactive agents and antibiotics has been associated with a significant decrease in pediatric mortality from severe sepsis and septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/2,3,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,18-22</a>]. With best clinical practices, mortality from septic shock in resource-rich settings is 0 to 5 percent among previously healthy children and 10 percent in chronically ill children. In one observational study, mortality was 19 percent among children who had persistent shock at pediatric intensive care unit admission, 62 percent of whom did not receive fluid administration and initiation of vasoactive infusions according to guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] In another prospective observational study, mortality from septic shock was 1 percent among children who met goals for timely administration of fluids and antibiotics versus 4 percent for those who did not (adjusted odds of death 0.2, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2555418118\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although current guidelines recommend rapid administration of fluid to children with septic shock using a &quot;push&quot; technique, the safety of this practice has been questioned by some studies in resource-limited settings. For example, in a small trial performed in India, children with septic shock, who were largely underweight for age, were more likely to be intubated in the first 24 hours if they were randomized to fluid boluses over 5 to 10 versus 15 to 20 minutes. However, resolution of shock and mortality were the same in both groups and a definitive conclusion regarding the role of rapid fluid resuscitation in causing a greater need for mechanical ventilation was limited by the small sample size, lack of central randomization, and lack of blinding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].&nbsp;Still, in light of evidence regarding potential harm from rapid fluid resuscitation in patients with severe febrile illness in resource-limited settings, it may be reasonable to use caution with both volume and speed of fluid boluses if access to mechanical ventilation is limited and life-threatening shock is not present. (See <a href=\"#H7455743\" class=\"local\">'Resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence regarding the outcomes of resuscitation of children with septic shock using normal saline or balanced crystalloid fluids (eg, lactated Ringer solution) is inconclusive and, until high-quality data is available, either crystalloid fluid is acceptable. In one retrospective study that used propensity-matched data from a national registry, exclusive resuscitation with balanced crystalloid fluids for the first 72 hours was associated with a shorter duration of vasoactive infusions, less acute kidney injury, and significantly lower mortality compared to normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, a second retrospective study that used data from insurance records and matched over 2000 children who received balanced crystalloid solution 1:1 with children who received normal saline found no difference in mortality, likelihood of acute kidney injury, or length of hospital or ICU stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we generally use a crystalloid solution instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albumin solution</a> because of the lack of clear benefit and higher cost of albumin. In children, randomized trials comparing colloid with crystalloid for hypotensive newborns and for children with dengue shock syndrome have not demonstrated a difference between the solutions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Choice of fluid'</a>). Among adults with sepsis, several randomized trials and meta-analyses have reported no difference in mortality when albumin was compared with crystalloids, although one meta-analysis suggested benefit in those with septic shock.

Although the findings are not consistent and multiple preparations are available, synthetic colloids, such as hydroxyethyl starch solutions, should be <strong>avoided</strong> because they have been shown to increase the risk of acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, and death in adults with severe sepsis or septic shock, especially with administered volumes &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>.

More children in the no fluid bolus group received blood transfusions in the first hour than in the fluid bolus groups (22 versus 2 to 4 percent). However, the overall amount of blood delivered after eight hours was not significantly different among the groups. A subsequent re-analysis of this study found that cardiovascular collapse from cardiotoxicity or ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients receiving fluids accounted for the excess mortality rather than fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Of note, none of the patients in this trial had hypovolemic dehydration or trauma as the primary cause of their illness, and patients with severe hypotension received 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of normal saline or albumin.

If obtaining blood cultures is difficult, it should not impede antibiotic initiation within the first hour. As discussed below, antifungal and antiviral agents should be included as part of the initial regimen for susceptible patients. </p><p>The rationale for the one-hour target for antimicrobial administration comes from observational studies that show poor outcomes with delays in antibiotic therapy, even beyond one hour. In one pediatric series of 130 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, delays greater than three hours were associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 4.0 [95% CI 1.3-12.1]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another prospective observational study, mortality from septic shock was 1 percent among children who met goals for timely administration of fluids within one hour and antibiotics within three hours versus 4 percent for those who did not (adjusted odds of death 0.2, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Each hour delay in antibiotic administration has been associated with an approximately 8 percent increase in mortality in adults.
