Most patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer have resectable tumors, and the results from surgery, radioiodine, and thyroxine therapy are excellent.</p><p>External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is used infrequently in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer. It is predominantly indicated for palliation of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease in patients whose tumors do not concentrate radioiodine. The role of EBRT in other settings is less certain.</p><p>The use of EBRT in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer will be reviewed here. Other aspects of the management of differentiated thyroid cancer are discussed separately, as is the role of EBRT in other thyroid malignancies, such as lymphoma and anaplastic as well as medullary thyroid cancer. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-lymphoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Radiation and chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaplastic-thyroid-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaplastic thyroid cancer&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis#H2716622\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Management of persistent/recurrent disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR EBRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, the main indication for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is for palliation in patients with unresectable locally advanced disease or symptomatic metastatic disease that is refractory to radioiodine. We also suggest EBRT to the thyroid bed and known sites of disease for the treatment of patients who have inoperable macroscopic or microscopic residual disease after thyroidectomy, with absent or inadequate radioiodine avidity. In addition, for older patients (age 55 years or older) who have gross extrathyroid extension (T4 disease, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>)) at the time of surgery, and selected younger patients with T4b or extensive T4a disease and poor histologic features (ie, insular or poorly differentiated histology) whose disease is resected but in whom there is a high likelihood of residual microscopic disease, which is known or strongly suspected to be non-radioiodine avid, we suggest EBRT.</p><p>For patients undergoing complete resection, lymph node involvement by itself is not an indication for EBRT because regional control is usually achieved with surgery and radioiodine. However, EBRT could also be considered for older patients with unresectable lymph node involvement (eg, nodal involvement that intimately involves the carotid artery).</p><p>In patients with local or regional recurrence, when feasible, repeat surgery and, if the tumor is iodine avid, additional radioiodine, is the preferred approach. However, patients with multiple recurrences in the thyroid bed or cervical nodes, especially if the interval between recurrences is short, may achieve control with EBRT. The risk of multiple operations versus the risks of EBRT should be reviewed for each such patient. EBRT also represents a reasonable approach to the rare patient with locally recurrent disease with loss of radioiodine avidity, such as may occur with multiple local recurrences in the thyroid bed or cervical nodes.</p><p>There are no randomized trials that address specific indications for EBRT in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, and practice is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In general, indications for EBRT in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer are based upon clinical experience and retrospective studies, which are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1414800\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1415809\"><span class=\"h3\">Macroscopic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with macroscopic unresectable disease in the neck that does not concentrate radioiodine, we suggest EBRT. Some thyroid cancer experts also administer EBRT to patients with unresectable disease in the neck despite radioiodine uptake, if the degree of iodine uptake compared to the size of the residual disease suggests that the radioiodine alone will be insufficient to control disease.</p><p>Many retrospective studies have shown a benefit of EBRT in patients with macroscopic residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/3-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-12</a>]. Radioiodine therapy alone is unlikely to eradicate residual tumor unless the absorbed dose of radiation is high, ie, at least 100 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one study, as an example, a single dose of radioiodine producing an absorbed dose over 80 Gy resulted in destruction of tumor in cervical lymph nodes in only 74 percent of patients with small-volume disease (less than 2 grams) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Further radiation in the form of EBRT can improve local control.</p><p>The efficacy of EBRT in controlling macroscopic residual disease is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from Hong Kong of 842 patients, 124 of whom had gross residual disease, the 69 patients who had EBRT had better local regional control at 10 years compared with those who did not have EBRT (56 percent versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 88 patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer that had been incompletely resected, the five-year survival was 77 percent with EBRT compared with 38 percent after surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, the five-year locoregional control was 69.2 percent for 19 patients with macroscopic residual or inoperable disease, and the five-year cause-specific survival was 58.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Even better results have been seen in more contemporary series, many of which utilized advanced radiation therapy approaches such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center reported on 66 patients with gross <span class=\"nowrap\">residual/unresectable</span> non-anaplastic, non-medullary thyroid cancer who received EBRT (77 percent with IMRT) over a 22-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The median overall survival was 42 months, and the three-year locoregional progression-free survival rate was 77.3 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MD Anderson group reported on 131 patients with high-risk or recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the 15 patients with gross residual or unresectable disease treated with IMRT (43.5 percent) or conventional EBRT, four had a complete response. The locoregional control rate was 22 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1415815\"><span class=\"h3\">Microscopic residual and completely resected high-risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest EBRT for patients with a microscopically positive resection and non-radioiodine-avid disease who are not candidates for reoperation. We also suggest EBRT for older patients (age 55 years or older) who have gross extrathyroid extension (T4 disease, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>)) at the time of surgery and selected younger patients with T4b or extensive T4a disease and poor histologic features (ie, insular or poorly differentiated histology) whose disease is resected, but in whom there is a high likelihood of residual microscopic disease.</p><p>The role of EBRT in patients with suspected microscopic persistent disease or a completely resected but high-risk tumor is poorly defined. EBRT may be beneficial for patients with complete resection who are at high risk of recurrence after radioiodine, but defining which patients are at risk and determining the population for whom EBRT should be offered remains controversial. Although older reports described either no benefit or even a deleterious effect of adjuvant EBRT, not all patients had received radioiodine therapy, which represents standard management for most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management#H3438702415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Radioiodine therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Modern-day studies of EBRT in patients receiving standard management suggest benefit in some patient groups. However, the role of EBRT in this setting has not been successfully studied in randomized trials. As an example, in one trial, patients with locally invasive completely resected differentiated thyroid cancer with extrathyroid extension or microscopically positive resection margins, treated with radioiodine and thyroid hormone suppression, were randomly assigned to receive additional EBRT or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was inadequate recruitment, and the trial became a prospective cohort study. Of the 47 patients participating in the study, 26 received EBRT. After a mean follow-up of 930 days, recurrences occurred in 0 versus 3 percent, and the difference was not statistically significant. A limitation of this study was the inclusion of patients at low risk of recurrence who were unlikely to benefit from the EBRT.</p><p>Retrospective studies suggest a benefit of EBRT in high-risk groups, particularly older patients with evidence of extrathyroidal extension at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/1,5,9,10,15,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,9,10,15,19-21</a>]. Most of the literature combines patients with completely resected high-risk disease, those with microscopically positive margins, and patients with locally recurrent tumors. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subgroup analysis of 70 patients from a single institution who were over 60 years of age, had extrathyroidal extension (T4 disease), and no gross residual disease after surgery, 47 received radiotherapy and 23 did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The ten-year cause-specific survival (81 versus 65 percent) and local-regional relapse-free rate (86 versus 66 percent) were significantly higher in patients who received radiotherapy than in those who did not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 169 patients with extrathyroidal extension who were free of disease after thyroidectomy, radioiodine, and thyroxine therapy, there were significantly fewer local and regional recurrences in patients who had received EBRT (7 versus 21 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MD Anderson group reported on 131 patients with high-risk or recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For patients with only microscopic residual disease who were treated with EBRT postoperatively, the four-year regional control rate was 86 percent and four-year cause-specific survival was 82 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, the five-year locoregional control was 89 percent for the 30 patients with clear or microscopic margins, and the five-year cause-specific survival was 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>While the results of these studies are generally favorable, the absence of a randomized control group makes it difficult to conclude that there is benefit from EBRT in resected patients with high-risk features. Furthermore, the decision to pursue EBRT must not be made lightly as EBRT can have lasting effects, including feeding tube dependence, xerostomia, and osteoradionecrosis. In one retrospective report, 5 percent of patients were dependent on feeding tubes because of significant late toxicity following EBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; however, feeding tube dependence was not reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>].

EBRT can be given alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy for such patients is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy#H12612780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to standard treatment: Chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Suggested approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1414807\"><span class=\"h2\">Distant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBRT may be useful for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who have progressive or symptomatic metastatic disease (soft tissue, bone, or central nervous system [CNS]) that is refractory to radioiodine and not amenable to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The role of chemotherapy for such patients is reviewed separately.

This may be stereotactic radiotherapy, if appropriate. For patients with asymptomatic indolent soft tissue metastases, monitoring without therapy may be acceptable. Stereotactic radiosurgery as opposed to EBRT is preferred for unresectable CNS oligometastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest EBRT for patients with unresectable bone metastases or multiple bone metastases that are refractory to radioiodine therapy. All patients with painful bone metastases should be referred for EBRT to aid pain control. EBRT is also used to control asymptomatic bone metastases if they are in weight-bearing sites. For solitary metastases, we usually give 50 Gy in 25 fractions, but we lower the dose to 40 Gy in 20 fractions in patients with spinal bone metastases in addition to radioactive iodine, to ensure that the dose to the spinal cord is safe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61712\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61712 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Radioiodine is often less effective in patients with bone metastases. As an example, in one report of 214 patients with distant metastases, the metastases took up radioiodine in 60 percent of those with bone involvement, but only 3 percent of these patients achieved complete remission after radioiodine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Given these disappointing results of radioiodine therapy in patients with bone metastases, an aggressive surgical approach has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, not all bone metastases are amenable to surgical resection. Therefore, EBRT is usually administered to patients with iodine-refractory, unresectable, symptomatic (or asymptomatic in weight-bearing sites) bone metastases.</p><p>Issues related to radiation therapy and the use of bone-modifying agents for patients with bone metastases are addressed elsewhere.

The clinical target volume is defined to cover thyroid bed, jugular, and posterior cervical lymph nodes within the limits defined above, including level III, IV, VI, and partially level V nodal regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 1</a>), and this volume is adjusted according to the surgical and pathology findings. Although some groups give more extensive nodal irradiation, we typically only treat the whole cervical and upper mediastinal lymph node chain in differentiated thyroid cancer that persists after neck dissection and radioiodine therapy or has extensive nodal extracapsular extension.</p><p>Typically, we prescribe 66 Gy in 33 fractions to the site of gross residual disease or area of high concern for microscopic residual disease, ie, the tracheoesophageal groove, concurrently with 56 Gy in 33 fractions to the rest of the clinical target volume.</p><p>External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) should ideally be delivered using advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT is becoming increasingly available and will likely become the standard for care in many radiation oncology centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/1,9,10,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10,29</a>].

These advantages are due to the fact that IMRT utilizes variable, computer-controlled intensities within each radiation therapy beam, in contrast to the uniform doses within conventionally planned two-dimensional EBRT or 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) planning and delivery techniques. The advantages of IMRT are particularly evident when the target volumes have complex shapes, concave regions, or are adjacent to many critical normal structures.

Dry mouth, esophageal stricture requiring dilation, and chronic dysphagia requiring a feeding tube have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A survey of 34 patients treated for advanced thyroid cancer showed that compared to thyroidectomy or thyroidectomy with postoperative radioiodine, there were significant decreases in chewing, swallowing, and appetite and significant increases in pain in patients who received EBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Long-term toxicity to normal tissues depends in part upon the size of each treatment fraction as well as the total radiation dose. Late effects can be minimized by delivering the lowest effective dose to the smallest area. Decreasing the size of each radiation fraction should permit higher total doses without increasing late morbidity.</p><p>While EBRT does not preclude future surgical intervention if required, surgery may be more challenging, and many surgeons are uncomfortable operating on a previously irradiated site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540325849\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-thyroid-nodules-and-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Thyroid nodules and cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3109212\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection is the primary treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine and then thyroxine therapy. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is used infrequently in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBRT is indicated for palliation in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who have unresectable locally advanced or symptomatic metastatic disease that is refractory to radioiodine. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for EBRT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15728420\" class=\"local\">'Palliative'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1414807\" class=\"local\">'Distant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have inoperable macroscopic residual disease after thyroidectomy, with absent or inadequate radioiodine avidity, we suggest EBRT to the thyroid bed and known sites of disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1415809\" class=\"local\">'Macroscopic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some thyroid cancer experts also administer EBRT to patients with unresectable disease in the neck despite radioiodine uptake, if the degree of iodine uptake compared to the size of the residual disease suggests that the radioiodine alone will be insufficient to control disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients over age 55 years with microscopically positive resection margins and non-radioiodine-avid disease who are not candidates for reoperation, we suggest EBRT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1415815\" class=\"local\">'Microscopic residual and completely resected high-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older patients (age 55 years or older) who have gross extrathyroid extension (T4 disease, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>)) at the time of surgery and selected younger patients with T4b or extensive T4a disease and poor histologic features (eg, insular or poorly differentiated histology), whose disease is resected but in whom there is a high likelihood of residual microscopic disease that is known or strongly suspected to be non-radioiodine avid, we suggest EBRT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1415815\" class=\"local\">'Microscopic residual and completely resected high-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with local or regional recurrence, when feasible, repeat surgery and, if the tumor is iodine avid, additional radioiodine is the preferred approach. However, patients with multiple recurrences in the thyroid bed or cervical nodes, especially if the interval between recurrences is short, may achieve control with EBRT. The risk of multiple operations versus the risks of EBRT should be reviewed for each such patient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for EBRT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive unresectable lung metastases not amenable to radioiodine, EBRT is used for palliation. For patients with asymptomatic indolent soft tissue metastases, monitoring without therapy may be acceptable. Stereotactic radiosurgery is preferred over EBRT for unresectable central nervous system (CNS) metastases. (See <a href=\"#H1414807\" class=\"local\">'Distant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unresectable, painful bone metastases or multiple bone metastases that are refractory to radioiodine therapy should be referred for EBRT to aid pain control. EBRT is also used to control asymptomatic bone metastases if they are in weight-bearing sites. (See <a href=\"#H1414807\" class=\"local\">'Distant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBRT should ideally be delivered using advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). (See <a href=\"#H56008271\" class=\"local\">'Radiation protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EBRT is associated with acute (skin erythema, mucositis, dysphagia) and long-term (skin pigmentation, dry mouth, esophageal stricture) adverse effects. Minimizing the dose and volume of tissue exposed reduces adverse effects but must not compromise disease control. (See <a href=\"#H654873\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Giuliani M, Brierley J.
