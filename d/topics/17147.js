There is no role for adjuvant systemic treatment outside a clinical trial setting.

Patients should be enrolled in formal clinical trials whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed response rates in 20 studies that included 1244 patients with non-clear cell RCC and 6300 with clear cell RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the studies that contained both non-clear cell and clear cell RCC patients, the objective response rate to targeted therapy was significantly lower in those with non-clear cell RCC (9.2 versus 14.8 percent). Progression-free survival and overall survival were both shorter in patients with non-clear cell RCC (7.5 versus 10.5 months and 13.2 versus 15.7 months, respectively); whether these differences in progression-free survival and overall survival are due to differences in biologic behavior of the disease or other factors is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a retrospective series that included 10 patients with non-clear cell histologies, there were no responses recorded to interleukin 2 (IL-2) therapy, and even with treatment, these patients had a median survival of less than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite these data, tumors with sarcomatoid features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], collecting duct tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>], or renal medullary carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>] may respond to chemotherapy, although the impact of chemotherapy has not been consistently shown. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The combination of adriamycin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> was assessed in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 8802, which included 38 patients with a tumor that had sarcomatoid features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The objective response rate (ORR) was 16 percent, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.5 and 8.8 months, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a separate trial of 25 patients with tumors containing sarcomatoid features, the combination of adriamycin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> yielded a PFS of just 2.2 months and an OS of 3.9 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Because of the lack of available treatments, clinical trials have focused on the utilization of angiogenesis inhibitors and molecularly-targeted agents. For patients with advanced or metastatic non-clear cell RCC, we administer a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitor. At the time of progression, this is followed by a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.</p><p>This recommendation is supported by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest experience comes from the phase II ASPEN trial, in which 108 previously untreated patients were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-treatment-approach-to-non-clear-cell-renal-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In that trial, patients treated with sunitinib had a longer median progression-free survival (PFS) with sunitinib compared with everolimus (8.1 versus 5.5 months).

The main subtypes of non-clear cell RCC include papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, unclassified, and translocation carcinomas. Sarcomatoid RCC is not considered a distinct subtype, primarily because sarcomatoid features can be seen in any histologic subtype of RCC. (See <a href=\"#H1657711888\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes of non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with clinically localized non-clear cell RCC (stage I to III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110735 \">table 1</a>)), we recommend surgical resection rather than medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients undergoing resection, there is no role for adjuvant therapy outside of a clinical trial setting.
