The majority is found incidentally in patients undergoing exploration for cholelithiasis; a tumor will be found in 1 to 2 percent of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The poor prognosis is thought to be related to advanced stage at diagnosis, which is due both to the anatomic position of the gallbladder, and the vagueness and nonspecificity of symptoms.</p><p>Surgery is the only potentially curative modality for patients with GBC. However, only a minority of patients is eligible for curative intent surgery because of disease extent (either locoregionally advanced and unresectable because of local invasion into critical structures or metastasized beyond locoregional confines). For the remainder, treatment is palliative in nature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment for localized, resected gallbladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of palliation for advanced GBC (as for other pancreaticobiliary cancers) is relief of pain and jaundice along with prolongation of life. Patients who have pain from local growth may benefit from radiation therapy (RT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Although biliary or intestinal bypass can be considered, percutaneous or endoscopic approaches are generally preferred, given the limited median survival in patients with advanced disease (generally, less than six months).</p><p>Here we will discuss the treatment of advanced unresectable GBC. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation of GBC, and treatment for localized, potentially resectable disease are covered separately, as is treatment for advanced bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment options for locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for advanced cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATION OF OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaundice caused by biliary obstruction is the presenting feature in 30 to 60 percent of patients with GBC; the usual cause is direct infiltration of the common hepatic duct by tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most patients who present with jaundice are typically not amenable to a curative resection.</p><p>Although biliary or intestinal bypass can be considered for palliation of obstructive jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], stenting via a percutaneous or endoscopic approach is generally preferred, given the limited median survival in patients with advanced disease (generally, less than six months). Drainage of as little as 30 percent of the liver parenchyma (as can be accomplished by unilateral drainage of one lobe of the liver) may be sufficient to adequately palliate jaundice and relieve pruritus.</p><p>Most stents are placed endoscopically. Although endoscopic methods appear to be better than percutaneous drainage in patients with lower bile duct obstruction caused by pancreatic and periampullary cancers, success rates may be lower and complication rates (particularly cholangitis) higher with the endoscopic approach in patients with malignant hilar obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Percutaneous and endoscopic approaches to biliary drainage were directly compared in a trial in which 54 consecutive patients with GBC and a Bismuth type II or III biliary obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75886 \">figure 1</a>) who were not suitable for resection were randomly assigned to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or endoscopic stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Successful drainage was more often achieved with percutaneous drainage (89 versus 41 percent), while early cholangitis was a more common complication of endoscopic stenting (48 versus 11 percent). Rates of stent occlusion (32 versus 39 percent) and median survival (60 days in both groups) were not significantly different.</p><p>However, the success rate with endoscopic drainage in this study (41 percent) is much lower than that usually seen in clinical practice, and it is not surprising that this group had a higher complication rate due to the high rate of unsuccessful instrumentation of an obstructed biliary system. Other complications may be more frequent with the percutaneous approach (eg, bile leaks and bleeding), potentially increasing morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Furthermore, percutaneous stents are usually left to open drainage external to the body, at least initially, and this is often inconvenient to the patient. As a result, in most institutions, an initial endoscopic attempt at drainage is usually preferred, as long as local endoscopic expertise is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RT WITH OR WITHOUT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR LOCALLY ADVANCED NONMETASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the rarity of GBC, management protocols for nonresectable disease are commonly extrapolated from studies of tumors of the pancreas or bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma). Like these two entities, dissemination of GBC is thought to be mainly locoregional, although GBC has a higher propensity for distant involvement than does cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In spite of this, the two tumors are generally managed similarly when they are locoregionally advanced and unresectable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment options for locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with cholangiocarcinoma, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may be considered for palliative management of patients with locally advanced unresectable disease, particularly if patients are symptomatic. At the time of exploration, the margins of unresectable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> residual disease are often marked with radiopaque clips to facilitate treatment planning.</p><p>There are very few data on the outcome of primary RT for unresectable GBC. Published retrospective series are small, contain small numbers of GBCs relative to extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and are heterogeneous with regard to treatment technique and RT dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The available data suggest that tumor control is rarely achieved with RT alone, in part because of the proximity of dose-limiting normal tissue that limits the potential to deliver an effective tumoricidal dose.</p><p>Most patients with locally advanced unresectable disease receive a combination of chemotherapy and RT to take advantage of the radiation-sensitizing properties of certain chemotherapeutic agents, although there are few data validating this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. With or without chemotherapy, the first site of failure in patients with a margin-positive resection is usually locoregional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, whether the use of chemoradiotherapy (or even RT alone) favorably impacts survival in the setting of locally advanced nonmetastatic disease continues to be debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-19</a>].</p><p>Despite uncertainty as to benefit, chemoradiotherapy is an acceptable choice for locoregional therapy of a locally advanced unresectable GBC. As with locally advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, most institutions still prefer the utilization of infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) during a course of external beam RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment options for locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWXz36Vm7rTFr+R9Uzv3HO05ED1Gei9+DmGHcRz0LAM8ZDYHKgb6e25tFXbwlgtK+Snb/LRLTmHDvToUPPCY3zWvc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2499\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> suggest either concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy or palliative chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced, unresectable GBC. On the other hand, consensus-based guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest systemic chemotherapy in this setting; radiation therapy may be considered in patients with localized disease after first-line chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. </p><p>Some patients may be rendered potentially resectable after chemoradiotherapy, but the frequency with which this occurs is unclear, and few data are available on long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic chemotherapy provides modest benefit in the treatment of advanced GBC. Most published series are small and consist of a heterogenous population of patients with GBC, cholangiocarcinoma, and occasionally some pancreatic and hepatic cancers that tend to respond differently to systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>Reported objective response rates with chemotherapy in patients with GBC include a range of 10 to 60 percent. There are only limited data evaluating the impact of treatment on survival. In the only randomized trial comparing best supportive care versus chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [FU] plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> [GEMOX]) in 81 patients with unresectable GBC, median overall survival was 4.5, 4.6, and 9.5 months in the basic supportive care, <span class=\"nowrap\">FU/leucovorin,</span> and GEMOX groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>All of the studies described below have been conducted in patients with adenocarcinoma, which is the most common histology of GBC. There are no available data that are specific to the treatment of advanced adenosquamous or squamous cell GBCs, and these patients are typically managed similarly. Treatment of patients with advanced small cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is discussed elsewhere.

Many, but not all, more recent series using either infusional FU in combination regimens or leucovorin-modulated FU report higher response rates and marginally longer survival (but still less than one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/35-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Infusional FU plus cisplatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusional FU has been combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> in at least two trials.
