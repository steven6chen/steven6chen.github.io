(The Basics)</div><div><a href=\"authors.htm?path=patient-education\" class=\"contributors-marketing\">Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate</a></div><div id=\"topicText\"><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H880534588\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a set age when people should stop driving?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no set age when older people should stop driving. It depends on many factors. It is true that older drivers can still be safe drivers. But it is also true that, besides teens, older drivers are involved in more deadly car crashes than any other age group.</p><p>Being able to drive is important to older people, and most people don't want to give it up. Driving gives people the freedom to go where they want, when they want. When people can't or don't drive, they have to depend on others. This can be hard for many reasons.</p><p>Each state has its own rules about older drivers. In some states, older drivers need to take written, vision, or road tests every time they renew their license. In other states, older drivers take no tests, or only a vision test, when they renew their license.</p><p>One way to check if someone is a safe driver is to have him or her take an on-the-road driving test. This test can be set up through your state or sometimes through a program that specifically works with older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H880534603\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors decide if a person should stop driving?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help decide if a person should stop driving, the doctor will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk with the person &ndash; He or she will ask about the person's medical conditions. Certain medical conditions make it more unsafe for people to drive. Some of these include heart problems, movement disorders, diabetes, arthritis, and sleep disorders. The doctor will also ask about medicines the person takes. Certain medicines can make people feel sleepy or slow down their reflexes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an exam &ndash; As part of the exam, the doctor will see how well the person moves, especially his or her neck, shoulders, and wrists. He or she will check the person's balance and grip strength. The doctor will also check the person's vision and hearing. Problems with any of these things can affect a person's driving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the person's thinking and memory &ndash; The doctor will ask questions to check the person's thinking and memory. It is unsafe for people with serious thinking or memory problems to drive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk with family members &ndash; The doctor will ask the family about the person's driving. He or she will want to know if the person has gotten lost when driving on a familiar route or had any near-accidents.</p><p/><p>In some states, doctors need to report people who can no longer drive safely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H880534618\"><span class=\"h1\">What conditions can keep people from driving short-term?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain things can keep people from driving for a short period of time. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heart attack &ndash; This is when one of the arteries that bring blood to the heart gets blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stroke &ndash; A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. This damages the nervous system and can cause problems with thinking, speaking, and moving an arm or leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A seizure &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make people pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a device called an &quot;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot; &ndash; This device prevents sudden death from a heart rhythm problem.</p><p/><p>The rules are different for each state. But in general, after these things happen, people need to wait a certain amount of time before they can drive again. For example, people who have a seizure need to be seizure-free for a certain amount of time before they can drive again. In some cases, people might need their doctor's permission before they drive again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H880534633\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my family member should stop driving, but won't?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your family member should stop driving but won't, you can try these tips. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hide the car keys.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the battery out of the car so it won't start.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Park the car on another block or in a spot where your family member won't find it.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make plans for someone else to do the driving.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the doctor to write a prescription saying the person should not drive.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set up a driving test with the state.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with a social worker to get help with the situation.</p><p/><p>If the person's license has been taken away, and he or she keeps driving, it can lead to problems. For example, if your family member gets into an accident, he or she will have to pay for damages and might get in trouble with the law.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H880534648\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mild cognitive impairment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tips-for-caregivers-of-people-with-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tips for caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Narcolepsy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
