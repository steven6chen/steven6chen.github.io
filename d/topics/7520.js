Fungal colonization of the upper and lower airways is a common condition, since fungal spores are constantly inhaled into the sinuses and lungs. However, colonization is distinct from infection, and most colonized patients do not become ill with fungal infections. &quot;Fungal rhinosinusitis&quot; is the most appropriate term to describe fungal infection of the paranasal sinuses since concomitant involvement of the nasal cavity is seen in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Fungal colonization, as well as the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis will be discussed here. An additional disorder, which involves a hypersensitivity response to colonizing fungi, is called allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and is reviewed separately.

Areas of mucosal injury may cause pooling of mucus and subsequent colonization by fungus. However, these abnormalities are generally of no clinical importance. <em>Aspergillus</em> species are the most common colonizers of the sinuses, but many other species are also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Generally, in chronic rhinosinusitis, the microbiome does not include fungi, but fungi are present in a small subset of patients, particularly those with polyps <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recent use of antibacterial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fungus balls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungal hyphae can become intertwined in dense collections and form fungus balls if there is obstruction of the paranasal sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Patients usually present with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis and involvement of only one sinus cavity. Computed tomography often shows a metal-dense spot within the fungus ball, and this finding was reported in 72 percent of cases in one series of 160 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. There may be mild sclerosis of the surrounding bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Surgery is required to correct the obstruction and to extract the fungus ball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>].

Invasive rhinosinusitis is one such form of infection that appears to be increasing in frequency. Although invasive fungal rhinosinusitis can be seen in apparently immunocompetent patients, the majority of cases involve patients with some form of immunosuppression.</p><p>Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis can be broadly classified as either acute or chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis tends to occur in patients with profound immunosuppression, has a time course of days to a few weeks, and involves hyphal invasion of blood vessels with resulting tissue infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients who are less immunocompromised, chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis occurs. This is a slowly destructive process with a typical time course of greater than 12 weeks; histopathology shows tissue destruction with a sparse inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of immunosuppression in patients with all forms of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic malignancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid organ transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids (systemic or intranasal)</p><p/><p>Infection in immunocompromised patients may be attributable to invasion by fungi that have chronically colonized the sinuses or to inhalation of fungal spores. Many patients with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis have a history of chronic rhinosinusitis, and some have anatomic abnormalities of their sinuses or antibacterial exposure that predispose to fungal colonization.</p><p>Invasion of tissues adjacent to the sinuses occurs after the fungi establish local infection. The aggressiveness of tissue invasion may vary depending upon the underlying immune status of the host. Profoundly immunocompromised patients and those with poorly controlled diabetes can experience rapidly progressive disease over the course of a few hours, whereas the disease may be more indolent in patients with well-controlled diabetes or normal immune function. The spread of infection out of the sinuses is usually due to direct extension, but fungemia with metastatic spread can also occur.</p><p>The fungi most often implicated in causing invasive rhinosinusitis are species of <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Fusarium</em>, the Mucorales, and dematiaceous (brown-black) molds, but the clinical presentation depends upon the causative pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/4,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute, fulminant infections are usually due to <em>Aspergillus</em> species, <em>Fusarium</em> species, and the Mucorales.

Facial numbness and diplopia can occur in the setting of cranial nerve involvement. Many patients already have extension of the infection outside the sinuses at the time of presentation.</p><p>A high degree of suspicion must be maintained in the immunocompromised patient with sinus complaints, especially facial pain. The nares and oral cavity should be carefully examined for necrotic areas; early nasal endoscopic evaluation by an otolaryngologist is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Necrosis results from vascular invasion by the fungi and can appear as palatal or gingival eschars, or sloughing of the nasal septum with perforation. Sensation is frequently lost in the malar areas, and visual loss can occur with involvement of the orbit or optic nerve. Orbital involvement can also result in proptosis and fixation of the globe.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) shows sinus involvement and may reveal bony erosions or extension of the infection to the globe, brain, cavernous sinus, or carotid artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66095\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66095 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, none of the findings on CT imaging are sufficiently specific to allow for a diagnosis of fungal versus bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed to assess intracranial and cavernous sinus involvement. The majority of patients with acute fungal rhinosinusitis have multiple sinuses involved, with the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses being the most common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic fungal sinusitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the chronic, indolent form of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis usually present with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis and few, if any, systemic complaints. These patients are often older and only mildly immunocompromised. Diabetes mellitus and low-dose glucocorticoids are risk factors that are often noted. <em>Aspergillus</em> spp and brown-black molds, and not the Mucorales, are more likely to cause this form of sinusitis. Chronic fungal rhinosinusitis has also been described in a patient who used intranasal cocaine, presumably because the resulting chronic irritation of the nasal passages allowed for fungal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Patients often endure the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis for months before the development of a complication, such as visual changes from orbital invasion or neurologic complaints due to brain involvement. The physical examination may reveal tenderness over the maxillary sinuses and erythema overlying the malar areas. Proptosis and fixation of the globe are seen with orbital involvement.</p><p>CT scan frequently shows involvement of a single paranasal sinus with a mass lesion and thickening of the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Bony erosions are common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is dependent upon histopathologic demonstration of fungal invasion by biopsy of involved areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Imaging modalities, such as CT scanning, are suggestive but are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to confirm a diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66095\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66095 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Evaluation of patients with suspected fungal rhinosinusitis should include early nasal endoscopy with biopsies of affected tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Cultures of the biopsy specimen are usually positive. Isolation of the infecting fungus is necessary to guide therapy. It is important to distinguish the agents of mucormycosis from <em>Aspergillus</em> and dematiaceous molds because antifungal therapies are different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive rhinosinusitis remains a very difficult infection to cure because most affected patients are immunocompromised. Overall survival is poor, and long-term survivors have significant sinonasal complications, especially when there is intracranial involvement and cranial neuropathies at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

It is a broad-spectrum triazole that can be used as an alternative to voriconazole in invasive fungal sinusitis caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp. It can also be used for step-down therapy of invasive fungal sinusitis caused by an agent of mucormycosis.</p><p>Assessment of the extent of infection should be accomplished with CT or MRI. Surgical evaluation should be conducted urgently for both diagnostic biopsy and for debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Surgical intervention is difficult in some patients because of the extent of the infection or the severity of the underlying disease. Radical surgical debridement is required in many cases to achieve cure and sometimes requires multiple surgeries.</p><p>Another important factor in treatment is the restoration of immune function by withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications, control of metabolic perturbations, and control of the underlying illness. The value of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or iron chelation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-rhinosinusitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] remains uncertain.</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> (0.7 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) has been used as initial therapy of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis, particularly if mucormycosis is likely because the agents of mucormycosis are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>.

Facial numbness or diplopia can occur in the setting of cranial nerve involvement. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute fungal sinusitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high degree of suspicion must be maintained in the immunocompromised patient with sinus complaints, especially facial pain. The nares and oral cavity should be carefully examined for necrotic areas. Early nasal endoscopic evaluation by an otolaryngologist is essential. Necrosis results from vascular invasion by the fungi and can appear as palatal or gingival eschars, or sloughing of the nasal septum with perforation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Acute fungal sinusitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49971489\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is dependent upon histopathologic demonstration of fungal invasion by biopsy of involved areas. Evaluation of patients with suspected fungal rhinosinusitis should include early nasal endoscopy with biopsies of affected tissues. Cultures of the biopsy specimen are usually positive. Isolation of the infecting fungus is necessary to guide therapy. It is important to distinguish the agents of mucormycosis from <em>Aspergillus</em> and dematiaceous molds because antifungal therapies are different. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49971497\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of invasive rhinosinusitis in the appropriate host should warrant empiric antifungal therapy with intravenous (IV) amphotericin B or, if mucormycosis is ruled out, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical evaluation should be conducted urgently for both diagnostic biopsy and for debridement. Radical surgical debridement is required in many cases to achieve cure and sometimes requires multiple surgeries. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another important factor in treatment is the restoration of immune function by withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications, control of metabolic perturbations, and control of the underlying illness. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer one of the lipid formulations of amphotericin B dosed at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV per day for the initial therapy of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis, particularly if mucormycosis is likely, because the agents of mucormycosis are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exceptions to this general recommendation include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection due to <em>Pseudallescheria boydii</em> (<em>Scedosporium apiospermum</em>) &ndash; <em>P. boydii </em>is generally resistant to amphotericin B and should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-scedosporium-and-lomentospora-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Scedosporium and Lomentospora infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection due to <em>Aspergillus</em> species &ndash; The regimen of choice for treatment of invasive infection due to <em>Aspergillus</em> species is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> with or without an echinocandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a>). For patients who are intolerant of voriconazole due to severe reactions, we would choose either a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (eg, AmBisome or Abelcet) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a>. The decision of which agent to choose depends on organ dysfunction, toxicities, and tolerability. Detailed recommendations are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of invasive aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infections due to most dematiaceous fungi (phaeohyphomycosis) are likely to be chronic and to respond to a triazole, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>. For these infections, we favor voriconazole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> is 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours for two doses, then 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 12 hours. The IV formulation is recommended for at least the initial few days. Oral step-down therapy, using 200 mg twice daily, can be used following an initial response to the IV formulation. It is essential to obtain voriconazole trough serum levels to ensure adequate concentrations and to avoid toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients initially receiving amphotericin B or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B, the duration of intravenous therapy depends upon the underlying immune status of the host, the extent of surgical debridement, and the response to therapy. We recommend continuing intravenous therapy until there is a clear clinical response and reversal of as many of the immunocompromising conditions as possible (eg, recovery from neutropenia, tapering of glucocorticoids, or engraftment in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients). This usually requires weeks of therapy and may require two to three months of therapy in patients with severe immunosuppression and slow clinical responses. After improvement is noted, suppressive therapy can be given with an oral antifungal agent. The most appropriate oral agent depends upon the causative pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Oral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppressive therapy is usually continued for at least three to six months. Some patients who remain immunocompromised require lifelong therapy.
