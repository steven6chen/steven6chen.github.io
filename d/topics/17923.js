This sample should be sent for pathologic review, immunophenotyping, cytochemistry, and cytogenetics. Marrow aspirate or peripheral blood blasts should also be sent for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> in order to rapidly identify Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL because more specific therapy is available for these patients.

As yet, the significance of the reappearance of ALL detected only by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once relapsed disease is identified, further pretreatment evaluation should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This is extremely important since HCT is the most likely method for curing patients with relapsed ALL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential; chemistries with liver and renal function, electrolytes, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin and total protein; and serology for hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Women of childbearing age should undergo a pregnancy test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and a study of cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction measured by echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed at baseline, especially for patients with a cardiac history, prior anthracycline exposure, or cardiovascular symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental evaluation for possible infectious foci is warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo imaging studies to evaluate for meningeal disease or central nervous system bleeding. Lumbar puncture is indicated in all patients to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for leukemic involvement. Care must be taken to avoid contaminating the CSF specimen with peripheral blood, if circulating blasts are present.

HCT offers a chance of cure in a small, highly selected group of patients. Even for patients who are not candidates for HCT, remission induction may prolong survival. </p><p>Some individuals may choose not to undergo remission induction due to frailty, comorbidities, or patient preference; in such settings, symptom-directed therapy (palliative care) is appropriate. </p><p>The general treatment principles for relapsed or refractory ALL apply to most disease presentations and patient populations. However, certain clinical presentations and disease subtypes require distinctive approaches.

The primary cause of failure is relapse. The IBMTR found that adults with high-risk or standard-risk ALL transplanted in second CR had similar relapse rates (56 versus 49 percent, respectively), but the LFS rates at four years were significantly lower for high-risk patients (22 versus 36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This observation suggests that nonrelapse causes for death account for the poorer prognosis in the high-risk patients.</p><p>The profile of prognostic factors for patients undergoing HCT in second CR is even more elusive than for patients in first CR. Almost all analyses addressing this issue have been performed on populations consisting of both adults and children, and the conclusions may not be directly applicable to the adults separately. Nevertheless, based upon indirect comparisons, HLA-identical allogeneic HCT appears superior to rescue with chemotherapy alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results of autologous HCT have been disappointing for adults with more advanced ALL. In one study, for example, there were no survivors among adults (greater than 18 years of age) transplanted in CR2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In two other series, relapse rates were unacceptably high in older patients and none of the patients over 28 years of age who were autografted in advanced disease survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p>As such, there appears to be little benefit from autologous HCT in adults with ALL in general. This is most likely due to the inability to collect leukemia-free stem cells from patients despite morphological CR. There is no advantage of autologous HCT over chemotherapy for consolidation of either high-risk or standard-risk patients in first CR. For patients beyond first CR, the relapse rate is unacceptably high following autologous HCT, with or without purging, and the overall results are very poor.</p><p>However, special situations may exist for those with Ph-positive ALL and those with no detectable residual disease by highly sensitive, multicolor, flow cytometry. The role of autologous HCT in patients with Ph-positive ALL who are rendered molecularly negative prior to stem cell collection and then maintained on a BCR-ABL1 inhibitor after transplantation remains under investigation. Long-term disease-free survival has been observed in some of these patients. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of adults with relapsed or refractory ALL is generally poor. Median survival is less than one year, and less than one-quarter of patients survive three years. Long-term overall survival (OS) is dependent upon attaining a complete remission (CR) with subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Approximately 31 to 44 percent of patients will attain a CR with second-line therapy, while 18 to 23 percent will attain a CR following third-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4,5,35,44,45,70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,35,44,45,70-73</a>].

In general, the only curative therapy for relapsed or refractory ALL is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of relapsed or refractory ALL must be confirmed with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy that is examined for morphology, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of suspected relapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretreatment evaluation should include a lumbar puncture to determine if there is involvement of the central nervous system, and HLA typing in anticipation of allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goal of remission induction therapy is achievement of complete remission or sufficient cytoreduction to enable allogeneic HCT. For most patients, we recommend remission induction therapy followed by allogeneic HCT rather than remission induction therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
