However, when assessing protein excretion, the urine dipstick is a relatively insensitive marker for initial increases in protein excretion, not becoming positive until protein excretion exceeds 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (upper limit of normal less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> with most individuals excreting less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>.</p><p>Using a specific assay for albumin is a more sensitive technique. The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min);</span> persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is called moderately increased albuminuria (the new terminology for what was formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is considered to represent severely increased albuminuria (the new terminology for what was formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and which is also called overt proteinuria, clinical renal disease, or dipstick positive proteinuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although these cut-offs defining moderately increased albuminuria and severely increased albuminuria facilitate determining the risk for progression of nephropathy, the risk of developing overt diabetic nephropathy is probably directly related to albumin excretion rates at all levels.</p><p>The clinical significance, screening, and management of moderately increased albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes will be reviewed here. In addition to being a marker of cardiovascular risk, moderately increased albuminuria that is increasing when factors such as blood pressure and blood glucose are controlled is also associated with development of nephropathy in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. As will be described below, moderately increased albuminuria is often present at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes and reflects underlying cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The significance of moderately increased albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes, the mechanisms of moderately increased albuminuria, the association of moderately increased albuminuria with cardiovascular risk, and the treatment of overt diabetic nephropathy are discussed separately.

Fever, exercise, heart failure, infections, and poor glycemic control are among the factors that can cause transient moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382921045\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample is the preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria in all diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,3,7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7,9,10</a>]. If an abnormal result (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> or higher) is noted in a patient who has previously had normal values, the test should be repeated twice more over a three- to six-month period to confirm that the albumin excretion is persistently elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test gives a quantitative result that correlates with the 24-hour urine values over a wide range of protein excretion, it is simple to perform and inexpensive, and repeat values can be easily obtained. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine albumin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the 24-hour urine collection was the initial gold standard for the detection of moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>], it has been suggested that screening can be more simply achieved by a timed urine collection or measurement of the urine albumin concentration on an early morning specimen to minimize changes in urine volume that occur during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Moderately increased albuminuria is unlikely if the albumin excretion rate is below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> in a timed collection or the urine albumin concentration is less than 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> in a random specimen. Higher values (particularly those just above this range) may represent false positive results and should be confirmed by repeated measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There are also a variety of semiquantitative dipsticks, such as Clinitek Microalbumin Dipsticks and Micral-Test II test strips, which have been used to test for moderately increased albuminuria if urine albumin excretion cannot be directly measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Guidelines on appropriate testing using dipsticks state that, of the available methods, the immunoturbidimetric assay is the most reliable and should be the standard for comparison because it has &gt;95 percent sensitivity and specificity to detect very low levels of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>One problem with measuring the urine albumin concentration or estimating it with a sensitive dipstick is that false negative and false positive results can occur, since the urine albumin concentration is determined by the urine volume as well as the amount of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, at a particular rate of albumin excretion, a substantial increase or decrease in urine volume will respectively lower and raise the urine albumin concentration. The confounding effect of the urine volume can be minimized by repeated measurements on early morning specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The confounding effect of variations in urine volume on the urine albumin concentration can be avoided by calculation of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urine specimen. A value 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine (or, using standard [SI] units, 3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine) suggests that albumin excretion is between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and, therefore, that moderately increased albuminuria is probably present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Values above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (or 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> are indicative of severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;). This classification system requires that <strong>at least two of three</strong> specimens fall within the moderately increased or severely increased albuminuria range over a three- to six-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In one report, for example, 24-hour urine collections and random, single-void urine specimens for albumin and creatinine were obtained in 14 normal subjects, 13 with type 1 diabetes, and 12 with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A close correlation was noted between the two measurements and the within-patient variability was very small. A random albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> had a sensitivity of 100 percent for the detection of moderately increased albuminuria. Similar findings have been noted by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28184610\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The albumin-to-creatinine ratio obtained from a first morning void sample appears to provide the best predictive value for renal disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This was shown in a subset analysis of the RENAAL trial in which methods of estimating protein excretion were compared in terms of their ability to predict renal outcomes, including the time of doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease. Compared with urinary albumin excretion and urinary protein excretion from a 24 hour collection, and to urinary albumin excretion from a first morning void, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio from a first morning void demonstrated the strongest association with the risk for renal events (hazard ratios of 4.36 (3.50-5.45) versus 3.16 (2.60-3.86) for 24 hour urinary albumin excretion; 3.02 (2.53-3.62) for 24 hour urinary protein excretion; and 3.23 (2.67-3.91) for urinary albumin concentration from a first morning void). The superior predictive capability reflects both an increase in albumin and decrease in creatinine generation and excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three important caveats that must be considered to maximize the reliability of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults#H425173\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Limitations of the UPCR and UACR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal time to measure the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is uncertain. The best data come from reports that primarily evaluated patients without diabetes. In a 1983 study, the best correlation with a 24-hour urine collection occurred with samples obtained after the first morning void and before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, a later and larger study found the best correlation with the first morning void, although the difference compared to spot urine samples at other times was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the uncertainty, we have a slight preference for first morning void specimens. If this is inconvenient, specimens can be obtained at other times during the day. There are no data about the timing of repeat measurements as the patient's course is being monitored. If possible, it seems preferable to obtain the samples at approximately the same time of day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vigorous exercise can cause a transient increase in albumin excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As a result, patients should refrain from vigorous exercise in the 24 hours prior to the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio will be diminished if creatinine excretion is substantially different from the expected value; this is particularly important in patients with borderline values. Albumin excretion will be underestimated in a muscular man with a high rate of creatinine excretion and overestimated in a cachectic patient in whom muscle mass and creatinine excretion are markedly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The ratio also varies with gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and with <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], as creatinine excretion is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following data might be considered to represent the &quot;natural history&quot; of moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) in patients with type 2 diabetes, since they were mostly obtained before the current era of recommended strict glycemic control, aggressive blood pressure control, and therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria among patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 10 years after the diagnosis ranges from 25 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. In a systematic review of 28 studies in type 2 diabetes (10,298 patients), the prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria was 26 percent at a mean diabetes duration of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The prevalence was similar (27 percent at eight years) in the ADVANCE trial of 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes that was published after the systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes varies with ethnicity, being higher in Asians and Hispanics than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The magnitude of this difference was illustrated in an international cross-sectional study of over 24,000 patients with type 2 diabetes without known albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At a mean duration of diabetes of almost eight years, the rate of moderately increased albuminuria was significantly higher in Asians and Hispanics (43 versus 33 percent in whites). As noted in the following section, there are also racial and ethnic differences in the rate of progression to severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;).</p><p>Some patients with type 2 diabetes have moderately increased albuminuria at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,27</a>]. This issue was addressed in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) of approximately 5100 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in which 6.5 percent had moderately increased albuminuria (and 0.7 percent had severely increased albuminuria) at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The annual rate of progression from normal albumin excretion to moderately increased albuminuria was 2.0 percent.</p><p>A higher rate of moderately increased albuminuria (17.9 percent) was noted in another report of over 3600 newly diagnosed patients who were recruited for the UKPDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The rate of moderately increased albuminuria was significantly higher in the 39 percent of patients with hypertension (24 versus 14 percent in those without hypertension). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Introduction and prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>The rate of moderately increased albuminuria at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes may be higher in older patients. This was illustrated in a cross-sectional population study of older adults in Finland (age 65 to 74 versus a mean of 52 years in the previous two studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Among 891 subjects who were free of diabetes at baseline, 69 developed diabetes at 3.5-year follow-up. Moderately increased albuminuria was present in 44 percent and hypertension in 68 percent of these patients; these values were significantly higher than in the subjects who did not develop diabetes (30 and 54 percent, respectively).</p><p>There are at least two possible explanations for the presence of moderately increased albuminuria at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: the patients had previously undiagnosed diabetes or some other disease (eg, benign nephrosclerosis) was responsible for the moderately increased albuminuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-and-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) and cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression to severely increased albuminuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, severely increased albuminuria (also called overt proteinuria, clinical renal disease, or dipstick positive proteinuria) is defined as albumin excretion greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> or a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine or, using standard (SI) units, 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine.</p><p>Among the approximately 5100 patients (81 percent Caucasian) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the UKPDS described in the preceding section, the prevalence of severely increased albuminuria was 5.3 percent at 10 years after diagnosis, compared to 25 percent for moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of progression from moderately to severely increased albuminuria was 2.8 percent per year, which is similar to the 20 to 40 percent rate within a 10-year period noted in other studies of mostly Caucasian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28,29</a>].</p><p>In the systematic review cited above, patients with moderately increased albuminuria had a significantly higher risk than those with normoalbuminuria of progressing to severely increased albuminuria (relative risk 7.5, 95% CI 5.2-10.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other risk factors contributing to progression to severely increased albuminuria include higher baseline levels of albuminuria, worse glycemic control as estimated from the hemoglobin A1c concentration, higher blood pressure, and cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Ethnicity may also be important as four- to five-year rates of progression to severely increased albuminuria as high as 37 to 42 percent have been described in Pima Indians and Israeli patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In addition to possible genetic differences, the patients in these two series were younger than in the studies described in the preceding paragraph, and the moderately increased albuminuria was almost certainly due to diabetes. In older patients, other causes for proteinuria (such as benign nephrosclerosis) that might progress more slowly than diabetic nephropathy could have accounted for the lower rate of progression to severely increased albuminuria.</p><p>Severely increased albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes is typically associated with a progressive reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the Pima Indian study, for example, the initial mean GFR was 143 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, 155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in those with moderately increased albuminuria, and 124 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in those with severely increased albuminuria (similar to the value in subjects with normal glucose tolerance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. During four-year follow-up, the GFR increased by 18 percent in the patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, decreased by 3 percent in those with moderately increased albuminuria, and decreased by 35 percent in those with severely increased albuminuria. The mean rate of loss of GFR in patients with severely increased albuminuria was 0.93 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per month, a rate similar to that observed in studies of severely albuminuric patients with type 1 diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50017\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50017 \">figure 1</a>).

Severely increased albuminuria (the new term for what was formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;) refers to albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with type 2 diabetes, the reported prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria at 10 years is between 25 to 40 percent. Some patients have moderately increased albuminuria at the time of diagnosis, which may be due to previously undiagnosed diabetes or some other disease that is responsible for the moderately increased albuminuria. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With type 2 diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria is associated with higher cardiovascular risk, possible progression to severely increased albuminuria, and increased long-term mortality. However, remission to normal albuminuria may occur. Factors associated with remission include short duration of moderately increased albuminuria, better glycemic control, better blood pressure control, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Regression to normal albuminuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred screening strategy for moderately increased albuminuria is measurement of the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in an untimed urinary sample. A value of 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> of creatinine (or, using standard [SI] units, 3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> of creatinine) suggests that albumin excretion is between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and, therefore, that moderately increased albuminuria is probably present. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio be measured yearly in patients with type 2 diabetes, although it is uncertain whether yearly testing should be continued in patients already treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. An elevated ratio should be confirmed with at least two additional tests performed over the subsequent three to six months, with confirmation of the diagnosis requiring at least two of three positive samples. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with persistent moderately increased albuminuria and blood pressures above goal, we recommend therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB rather than other antihypertensive agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Other drugs are added as necessary. Issues related to goal blood pressure in patients with diabetes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitors and ARBs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Goal blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on the value of treating moderately increased albuminuria with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes who are normotensive, since no trials have been limited to patients who have a baseline blood pressure below <span class=\"nowrap\">135/85</span> mmHg. In such patients, aggressive glycemic and lipid control are recommended, but angiotensin inhibition is not warranted solely to reduce albuminuria. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitors and ARBs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is insufficient evidence to recommend ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy for primary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes who have normal albumin excretion and who are <strong>normotensive</strong>. In addition, there is evidence that such therapy is not helpful. These patients should be screened yearly for moderately increased albuminuria and an angiotensin inhibition initiated if persistent moderately increased albuminuria is documented. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Normotensive patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with type 2 diabetes who have normal albumin excretion and who are <strong>hypertensive</strong> should be treated to attain goal blood pressure.
