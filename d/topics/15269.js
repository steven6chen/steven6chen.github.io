In addition, stress echocardiography is one of the recommended methods for identifying residual ischemia post MI.

As discussed separately, the diagnosis of an acute MI is typically based upon the history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and serum troponins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography is an accurate noninvasive test that enables detection of evidence of myocardial dysfunction caused by ischemia or necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evaluation of wall motion while a patient is experiencing chest pain can be useful when the ECG is nondiagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Evaluation of wall motion may also be useful if there is ECG or laboratory evidence of MI even in the absence of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Severe ischemia produces regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) that can be visualized echocardiographically within seconds of coronary artery occlusion (12&plusmn;5 and 19&plusmn;8 seconds in two series of patients evaluated during transient coronary occlusions induced by angioplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These changes occur prior to the onset of ECG changes or the development of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79335 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The RWMAs reflect a localized decrease in the amplitude and rate of myocardial excursion, as well as a blunted degree of myocardial thickening and local remodeling.</p><p>Since ischemic RWMAs develop prior to symptoms, chest pain in the absence of RWMAs should not be due to active myocardial ischemia. However, the converse is not true; the presence of RWMAs does not establish the diagnosis of ischemia. There are a number of other causes of RWMAs, including a prior infarction, focal myocarditis, prior surgery, left bundle branch block, ventricular preexcitation via an accessory pathway, and cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Thus, echocardiography for an acute coronary syndrome (MI or unstable angina) has a high sensitivity but a relatively lower specificity. These predictions were confirmed in a study of 180 patients with chest pain in the emergency department; the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RWMAs were present in 27 of 29 patients with an acute MI (sensitivity 93 percent as two non-ST elevation MIs were not apparent). By comparison, the initial ECG was diagnostic (ST elevation with or without Q waves) in only nine of these patients, and eight had an ECG that was not interpretable for an acute MI (due to left bundle branch block, pacing, or left ventricular hypertrophy with strain). Thirteen patients subsequently developed pathologic Q waves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RWMAs were indicative of acute MI in only 31 percent of 87 patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 88 patients without RWMAs, only 2 (2.2 percent) subsequently &quot;ruled in&quot; for a non-ST elevation MI by cardiac enzymes.</p><p/><p>It may be impossible to distinguish RWMAs due to acute ischemia from those due to a previous MI. One clue, the preservation of normal wall thickness and normal reflectivity, suggests an acute event, while a thin akinetic reflective segment suggests chronicity. Most authorities recommend utilization of left-sided contrast for better delineation of the endocardial border when standard views are difficult to interpret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The presence of reversible RWMAs, as well as reversible ECG changes, is consistent with the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. The time course of recovery after the cessation of chest pain is variable, ranging from less than two hours in patients with a short duration of chest pain (&le;10 minutes) to more than 24 hours in patients with prolonged angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This delay in recovery, which occurs in the absence of recurrent chest pain, may reflect myocardial stunning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Patients with stress cardiomyopathy typically present with chest pain, ECG changes, and cardiac enzyme elevations with normal coronary arteries. Significant wall motion abnormalities can be identified with echocardiography, most commonly affecting the apical and mid portions of the ventricle; other variants, including a type with midventricular hypokinesis, have been described. Wall motion usually returns to normal after a period varying from days to several months.

Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) correlate closely with other methods of assessing an MI such as pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], left ventriculography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or nuclear perfusion imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purposes of localizing segmental wall motion abnormalities in a standardized format, the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) has recommended dividing the ventricle into 16 segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55855 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. The American Heart Association (AHA), as part of an effort to unify wall motion analysis among different imaging modalities, concluded that a 17-segment model was preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64968 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The different echocardiographic views permit visualization of regions of the myocardium perfused by the different coronary artery branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61847\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61847 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72224 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anteroapical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the septum, apex, and anteroseptal regions of the left ventricle are typical of occlusion of sites in the left anterior descending coronary artery circulation; they are best seen in the parasternal long axis and apical two- or four-chamber views. The presence of diastolic deformity, sharply demarcated, indicates aneurysm formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Inferobasal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inferior infarctions usually arise from occlusion of the right coronary artery and occasionally from occlusion of a posterior descending branch arising from the circumflex artery in a left dominant system. Most RWMAs arising from right coronary occlusion are found at the base of the inferior or diaphragmatic wall; in contrast to anterior infarctions, the apex is often spared.</p><p>These wall motion abnormalities are well seen in the short axis but even better by using the apical two chamber view with a slight degree of posterior tilt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral or free wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left ventricular free wall is a less common site for isolated MI; though the lateral wall may become akinetic in circumflex artery occlusion, the lateral wall is more frequently involved as a component of multisegmental involvement. Left main disease may cause anterior, lateral, and apical wall motion abnormalities, and left anterior descending artery disease may involve the entire apex, including the lateral apex. The base of the free wall is the least likely site of an ischemic echocardiographic abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Right ventricle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstruction of the proximal right coronary artery proximal to the right ventricular marginal branches may infarct the inferior wall of the left ventricle and the right ventricle. Some studies suggest that as many as 40 percent of inferior infarctions are complicated by some degree of right ventricular dysfunction. However, there is a major difference between mild subclinical depression of right ventricular contractile function, which is associated with subtle echocardiographic abnormalities, and severe impairment of right ventricular performance, which can lead to hypotension or shock, due to reduced left ventricular preload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2003 American College of Cardiology (ACC), the AHA, and the ASE task force gave a class I recommendation to the use of echocardiography for the evaluation of patients with inferior MI and clinical evidence suggesting possible right ventricular infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, evaluation of suspected right ventricular infarction was classified as appropriate in the 2011 Appropriate Use Criteria for Echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The echocardiographic manifestations of right ventricular infarction are abnormal right ventricular free wall motion and right ventricular dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The most reliable echocardiographic signs of hemodynamically important right ventricular infarction are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the right ventricle with or without segmental wall motion abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased descent of the right ventricle base</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plethora of the inferior vena cava (defined as a less than 50 percent decrease in inferior vena cava diameter after deep inspiration)</p><p/><p>Since a patent foramen ovale is present in 20 to 30 percent of normal individuals, the elevation of right-sided filling pressures accompanying severe right ventricular dysfunction can result in acute right-to-left shunting. This complication should be suspected when patients with an inferior MI have an otherwise unexplained reduction in the arterial oxygen saturation.</p><p>Right-to-left shunting can be readily detected by performing an intravenous agitated saline contrast study, which shows the passage of microbubbles from right to left across the middle of the atrial septum. A contrast study is performed by attaching two 5 mL syringes to a three-way stop cock to an indwelling 18 gauge needle in the right antecubital fossa vein. A mixture of saline and a minute amount of air (approximately 0.1 mL) is passed rapidly between the two syringes until the saline has a gray appearance. The valve is then rotated so that the syringe with the solution can be forcefully injected with the arm elevated and the upper arm massaged. If a patent foramen ovale is the cause of hypoxemia, saline bubbles will appear in the left ventricle within one or two beats of their first appearance on the right side.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple segment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the apex and base are the site of RWMAs, the segment of the septum that lies across from the moderator band of the right ventricle is occasionally spared. This pattern reflects the moderator band artery (ramus limbi dextri), arising from a relatively proximal portion of the right coronary artery, which provides collateral circulation to a limited segment of myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of infarct</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2003 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/ASE</span> task force gave a class I recommendation to the use of echocardiography for assessment of infarct size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The 2011 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/ASE</span> appropriateness criteria classified as appropriate the initial evaluation of left ventricular function following acute coronary syndrome and for re-evaluation of left ventricular function following acute coronary syndrome during the recovery phase when results will guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Two-dimensional echocardiographic studies have shown that the extent of the infarction is underestimated in up to 95 percent of cases if judged solely by the electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

In an echocardiographic study of 50 such patients, 43 had a ventricular septal defect and seven had papillary muscle rupture or severe dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The 2003 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/ASE</span> task force recommended echocardiography for the assessment of mechanical complications after acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Because of the initial high pressure differential between the left and right ventricle, there is a high velocity shunt through the septal defect.

Thrombi are important clinically because of their potential for embolic complications, including stroke. Echocardiography can document both the presence of thrombus and of risk factors for embolization. The 2003 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/ASE</span> task force gave a class I recommendation to the use of echocardiography for the assessment of mural thrombus after acute MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51575\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51575 \">movie 14</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This containment is weak but life-saving. The differentiation between the two types of aneurysm is important because a pseudoaneurysm is an indication for urgent surgery. On echocardiography, pseudoaneurysms have a narrow inlet or neck that is less than 40 percent of the maximal aneurysm diameter, while true aneurysms have wide inlets.
