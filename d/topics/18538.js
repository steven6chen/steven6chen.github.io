Less commonly, women with a uterine mass presumed to be a leiomyoma are found to have a uterine sarcoma or a leiomyoma variant. There are a number of leiomyoma variants in which the smooth muscle neoplasm manifests one histologic facet typical of malignant neoplasm, yet lacks others. Other variants are defined by their capacity to spread to other organs without invasion, and thus remains histologically benign. Finally, some smooth muscle neoplasm variants cannot be definitely classified and consequently are deemed to have an uncertain malignant potential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas#H4483477\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Presumed benign leiomyomas'</a>.)</p><p>Histologically and biologically defined variants of uterine leiomyomas are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of ordinary uterine leiomyomas, as well as approaches to differentiating leiomyomas from uterine sarcomas, are discussed separately.

In contrast, other myometrial smooth muscle variants are less frequent (approximately 1 to 2 percent in aggregate) and uterine sarcomas are rare (0.1 percent or less, depending on age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Differentiating between these, and thus providing appropriate evaluation and treatment, is clinically challenging.</p><p>Most leiomyoma variants present as presumed typical &quot;fibroids&quot; and are excised by gynecologists if they are symptomatic. The presence of an extrauterine mass makes it clear that this is a leiomyoma variant rather than a typical leiomyoma. Some of these cases come to attention as referrals when a woman with a thoracic mass initially presents to pulmonary or cardiovascular colleagues.</p><p>The rarity of leiomyoma variants limits epidemiologic study and, by extension, evidence-based guidance for diagnosis and treatment, especially for selected variant types that essentially are restricted to case reports and small case series. Most variants, being histologically defined, are diagnosed only after surgical removal; however, increasingly, abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may suggest an atypical lesion, sometimes even prompting surgical excision.</p><p>For most women who undergo hysterectomy for a presumed typical fibroid and are found to have a nonmalignant leiomyoma variant, no further evaluation or management are needed as there is no evidence of risk of disseminated or recurrent disease. Thus, in such cases, there are no adverse consequences of not making the diagnosis preoperatively.</p><p>The important exceptions to this are variants in which malignancy cannot be excluded by pathologic examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesions with extrauterine spread. Other exceptions are variants with histologic links to a heritable tumor predisposition syndrome (hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma [HLRCC], also known as Reed syndrome) and pathologic diagnosis of a fumarate hydratase-deficient smooth muscle tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115272 \">picture 1</a>) requires further genetic evaluation, even after hysterectomy. Follow-up management for these conditions is discussed in the sections below.</p><p>For women with a pathologic diagnosis of a leiomyoma variant who undergo a uterine-sparing procedure, annual surveillance is warranted, most commonly a pelvic ultrasound and, if uterine disease is detected, a pelvic MRI.</p><p>The variants of greatest concern include (from more to less concerning):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leiomyomas associated with heritable tumor predisposition (HLRCC syndrome)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leiomyoma variants removed using a power morcellator without containment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical leiomyoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitotically active leiomyomas with proliferative rates approaching the threshold for malignant diagnosis</p><p/><p>Expertise in these lesions may vary between institutions, pathology laboratories, and gynecologists specializing in fibroids; gynecologic and medical oncologists also may have additional expertise, particularly for variants of uncertain malignant potential or extrauterine involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23338813\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several rare syndromes with leiomyomas or other uterine low-grade smooth muscle neoplasms that require differentiation from ordinary uterine leiomyomas. The classification of these variants continues to evolve as information is gained about their pathobiology. The categories are largely descriptive in nature and are only beginning to be characterized in molecular and genetic terms.</p><p>Advances in genomic technologies have been applied to many uterine tumors, including leiomyomas. These studies have found mutations in exon 2 of <em>MED12</em> in 70 percent of typical leiomyomas. This raises the possibility that this mutation drives benign neoplastic transformation and growth in typical leiomyomas. In contrast, <em>MED12</em> exon 2 mutations are infrequent (&lt;20 percent) in cellular and atypical leiomyomas, supporting the notion that leiomyoma variants arise from pathologic processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The genotype-phenotype correlation for fumarate hydratase-deficient leiomyomas and hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma syndrome has been recognized and is being incorporated into routine pathology practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. In the future, we hope the diagnosis and management of additional leiomyoma variants will incorporate molecular and genetic markers to supplement their histological evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1166265\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of benign versus malignant neoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyoma variants are classified as benign or malignant based upon histologic features. Gross characteristics may suggest that a lesion is benign or malignant, but do not confirm a diagnosis. While some variants include lesions with extrauterine extension or spread, this does not automatically confer a diagnosis of sarcoma or malignant neoplasm if the histology is benign-appearing. On the other hand, some of the variants have histologic findings that make it difficult to define them as benign or malignant (eg, smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential).</p><p>Benign smooth muscle neoplasms (ie, leiomyomas of the usual histologic type or &quot;garden-variety&quot; leiomyomas) are defined as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low mitotic index (&lt;5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields [HPF])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No cytologic atypia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No cell necrosis (apart from bland degeneration due to tumor ischemia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spindle-shaped cells that are uniform in size and shape</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No intravascular component</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-circumscribed mass</p><p/><p>Smooth muscle tumors are primarily designated as malignant according to the presence and extent of three histologic characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abundant mitoses (&ge;10 per 10 HPF, depending on other characteristics)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent nuclear atypia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of coagulative tumor cell necrosis in a &quot;geographic&quot; (like islands on a map) fashion, so-called &quot;tumor cell necrosis&quot;</p><p/><p>The distinction of leiomyosarcoma from other lesions based on various complex combinations of these features was proposed based upon a large clinicopathological series and is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78735 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>It should be appreciated by clinicians relying on pathology reports that all three parameters have technical considerations that introduce subjectivity into their interpretation, and these considerations often become important for cases near the threshold for each parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Management of such cases may benefit from more-than-usual dialogue between clinician and pathologist or review by an outside expert gynecologic pathologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167790\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN VARIANTS OF LEIOMYOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas exhibit the same symptoms and signs as ordinary leiomyomas. There are no imaging modalities that can distinguish histologic variants from other leiomyomas. They are diagnosed by pathology examination following myomectomy or hysterectomy. Management is the same as for ordinary leiomyomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16698972\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitotically active leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These types of leiomyoma variants are typically small, well circumscribed, and almost always behave in a benign fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15</a>]. The clinical manifestations and management of these leiomyomas are the same as for ordinary leiomyomas.</p><p>These variants are defined by the isolated presence of one feature associated with a malignant neoplasm, which is increased proliferative activity. Specifically, they are leiomyomas with an increased mitotic count (&ge;5, but &lt;15 mitoses per 10 high-powered fields [HPF]) but lacking atypia or geographic tumor necrosis.</p><p>Mitotically active leiomyomas often have increased cellularity, which may blur the distinction between this variant and the cellular variant. Before making the diagnosis of a mitotically active leiomyoma with hypercellularity, its morphological mimics (endometrial stromal nodule and sarcoma) should be excluded.</p><p>In terms of classification, these two types of variants often overlap. Mitotically active leiomyomas are often hypercellular, and cellular leiomyomas are often mitotically active. When both features are present, diagnosis of a mitotically active leiomyoma generally is preferred, but individual pathologists may vary in how they report these entities. (See <a href=\"#H3673350440\" class=\"local\">'Cellular leiomyomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Interestingly, the hormonal milieu appears to influence mitotic index of benign smooth muscle neoplasms. Leiomyomas are more likely to have a high mitotic count if they are excised during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or when women are receiving exogenous progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Benign smooth muscle neoplasms with exceedingly high mitotic counts (&gt;15 per 10 HPF) are rare, and some have been associated with malignant outcomes. Consequently, the diagnosis of a smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential is appropriate for extremely proliferative tumors, even in the absence of other histologic features of malignant neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H710161387\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasms with uncertain clinical behavior'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167813\"><span class=\"h2\">Myxoid leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These lesions appear to have no premalignant potential; however, myxoid leiomyomas must be distinguished from their malignant counterpart. Myxoid leiomyosarcomas are distinguished by the presence of nuclear atypia or myometrial infiltration.</p><p>Myxoid leiomyomas contain abundant extracellular stroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Myxoid change can be a focal finding in up to 12 percent of ordinary leiomyomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167935\"><span class=\"h2\">Epithelioid leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epithelioid leiomyomas are exceedingly rare, and therefore, there is limited experience regarding clinical behavior.</p><p>Epithelioid leiomyomas are benign neoplasms in which rounded or polygonal cells that appear similar to epithelial cells make up at least 50 percent of the neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Malignant potential may be associated with far lower mitotic rates (&gt;5 per 10 HPF) in epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with atypia.</p><p>Previous terms for this entity were leiomyoblastomas or clear cell leiomyomas.</p><p>In addition, the diagnosis of a neoplasm with perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation (PEComa) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasm in which leiomyoma is a consideration. PEComas are typically comprised of epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm and express markers of melanocytic differentiation such as HMB-45, Melan-A (MART-1), and <em>MITF</em> in addition to smooth muscle markers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1168074\"><span class=\"h3\">Plexiform leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plexiform leiomyomas are epithelioid neoplasms that appear histologically as nested or ribbon-like areas of smooth muscle cells surrounded by extensive extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are rare reports of plexiform neoplasm of the uterus having infiltrative behavior similar to endometrial stromal sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, this histologic pattern is often found in intravenous leiomyomatosis. Genetic analysis, however, suggests they are a benign variant in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1167278\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous leiomyomatosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1168177\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissecting leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dissecting leiomyoma (cotyledonoid leiomyoma) is characterized by a pattern of nodular smooth muscle tumorlets surrounded by a hydropic matrix that appears to permeate or penetrate adjacent myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These neoplasms may extend beyond the uterus and involve the broad ligament, resulting in pelvic congestion and an appearance like the placental cotyledons.</p><p>The nodularity seen in this variant likely represents an extreme form of hydropic degeneration. Patches of watery degeneration, often associated with chronic ischemic changes, are common in garden-variety leiomyomas. Other extreme forms of hydropic degeneration include cystification or cavitation.</p><p>On gross examination, in addition to their architectural abnormalities, such degenerating neoplasms are often tan or brown, and softer than typical leiomyomas, as they have less collagenous material in their extracellular matrices. Microscopic examination of such tumors reveals the bland histologic features shared with typical leiomyomas.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and treatment of these leiomyomas are the same as for ordinary leiomyomas. An exception to this is that hysterectomy is more likely to be technically feasible in women with this type of disease than myomectomy because of the larger size of the lesions and the often poorly defined gross margins with the adjacent myometrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H710161387\"><span class=\"h1\">NEOPLASMS WITH UNCERTAIN CLINICAL BEHAVIOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3806712\"><span class=\"h2\">Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP; group IVA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78735 \">table 1</a>)) have some characteristics of sarcomas but do not meet full diagnostic criteria. Among uterine leiomyoma variants, these are the most concerning in terms of progression or missed diagnosis of sarcoma. These neoplasms are rare and thus the paucity of data makes it difficult to describe their clinical behavior. In fact, these are probably not a distinct entity, but represent neoplasms for which the capacity to invade and metastasize (ie, leiomyosarcoma) cannot be determined by usual pathology methods.</p><p>The frequency of STUMP is difficult to determine as estimates vary between various institutions, presumably due to differences in how pathologists apply diagnostic criteria. We emphasize it here because the lack of a consistent definition poses a challenge to outcome prediction and clinical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3806889\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy exists regarding the classification of STUMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11,12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,18,19</a>]. The focus of this debate is which of the criteria for malignant neoplasms (high mitotic activity, cellular atypia, necrosis) should be used to most accurately identify the metastatic potential of a particular neoplasm. Other histologic parameters, such as the presence of atypical mitotic figures or tumor invasion into adjacent myometrium, may also be associated with malignant outcomes.</p><p>A particular pattern of coagulative necrosis is the feature that best predicts malignant behavior in STUMP, according to the largest clinicopathologic series that included 213 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This pattern of necrosis has irregular, &quot;geographic&quot; shapes like islands on a map and a sharp transition between viable and nonviable tumor tissue. More than one area of geographic tumor necrosis is often present. Geographic tumor necrosis must be distinguished from more common degenerative processes, usually due to ischemia or abrupt hormonal changes commonly found in benign leiomyomas.</p><p>One area of ambiguity in the series cited above centers on the four patients with tumors with coagulative necrosis but without significant cellular atypia or a high mitotic index (&lt;10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields [HPF]); one of these four patients had recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, these tumors were designated &quot;smooth muscle tumors of low malignant potential, limited experience.&quot; Another problematic area is when necrosis is identified, but cannot be unambiguously classified as being malignant-type geographic or benign-type ischemic necrosis. Because of the importance of classifying necrosis, such difficult tumors may be diagnosed as having an uncertain malignant potential.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether STUMP represents a real phenotypic overlap between pathogenetically separate benign and malignant neoplasms that represent the limitations in our ability to distinguish which neoplasms might metastasize (leiomyosarcoma) and which we are relatively certain won't (leiomyoma). Much less likely, STUMP may represent a true intermediate in a pathway progressing from benign to malignant. In the authors' experience, however, smooth muscle tumors with features falling just short of satisfying the criteria defined by the largest series also may be malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The risk of adverse outcome (5 to 30 percent) appears to depend on the stringency of pathologic criteria used for diagnosis of STUMP. The specific criteria that is most effective at identifying tumors with the highest risk of metastasis or aggressive local recurrence is controversial and an active subject for ongoing investigation by many expert gynecologic pathologists. Nevertheless, though we cannot precisely predict outcomes, it seems clear that adding additional histological parameters further stratifies the risk of adverse outcome. Although histological grading is not effective at predicting outcome in leiomyosarcomas, tumors classified as STUMP at our institution that subsequently behaved aggressively all have had significant nuclear atypia. For such tumors, they generally are not classified as malignant because they have mitotic rates lower than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF.</p><p>It must be recognized that enumeration of mitoses is dependent on sampling, which is subject to undercounting due to biological and statistical variation. Consequently, atypical smooth muscle tumors with 8 or 9 mitoses per 10 HPF may be regarded as STUMP, particularly if they have other worrisome features such as atypical mitotic figures or destructive tumor cell infiltration into the smooth muscle fascicles of adjacent myometrium (the latter based on unpublished data and experience). Smooth muscle tumors with very high mitotic rates (&gt;15 per 10 HPF) also may merit the diagnosis of STUMP due to their rarity and unpredictability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3807065\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of STUMP are the same as benign uterine leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas (ie, uterine mass, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure)</span>. Likewise, there is no imaging modality that can reliably distinguish these lesions from other uterine neoplasms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neoplasms classified as STUMP have a recurrence risk estimated in one meta-analysis as 17 percent, but this rate may vary depending on how the histological criteria are applied to a particular tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Depending on the stringency of criteria applied, 5 to 30 percent of STUMP will subsequently metastasize or recur locally in an aggressive fashion, according to unpublished data.</p><p>STUMP is diagnosed upon pathology evaluation following myomectomy or hysterectomy. There are no available guidelines regarding whether hysterectomy, if not already performed, is required in women with this diagnosis. For women who have been diagnosed with STUMP following myomectomy, a detailed discussion should be held with the patient to review the characteristics of the neoplasm and the patient's plans for future pregnancy. Management options include hysterectomy or annual surveillance with pelvic imaging. More frequent surveillance, such as every four to six months, may be warranted, especially in the first several years and, depending upon the histologic features of the neoplasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> factors, may interfere with the pathology evaluation (eg, the tumor was incompletely excised or was morcellated at the time of surgery). If pelvic imaging is used, we use transvaginal ultrasound to rule out the presence of new uterine masses and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium to evaluate the characteristics of any new uterine masses.

The presence or absence of atypia is usually judged based upon nuclear changes, but cytoplasmic changes may also be evident. In addition to hyperchromasia, nuclear enlargement, and pleomorphism, giant tumor cells with multiple and multilobated nuclei are common. The atypia must be &quot;significant&quot; (moderate to severe in histologic terms); neoplasms with mild changes are not classified as atypical leiomyomas.</p><p>Tumors with 8 to 9 mitoses per 10 HPF or ambiguous necrosis (ie, not clearly either geographic or ischemic-type) and significant cytologic atypia are classified as a STUMP by most gynecologic pathologists. Neoplasms with bizarre nuclei and &gt;10 mitosis per 10 HPF are considered leiomyosarcomas. Geographic tumor necrosis, a pattern of coagulative necrosis that is distinct from ischemic-type necrosis and associated with malignant smooth muscle neoplasia, cannot be present. In addition, identification of other worrisome findings such as atypical mitotic figures or infiltrative tumor margins in a uterine smooth muscle neoplasm with bizarre nuclei may prompt diagnostic consideration of leiomyosarcomas or STUMP.</p><p>Uterine neoplasms arising in individuals with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome may be diagnosed as leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei. Neoplasms associated with HLRCC often have prominent orangeophilic nucleoli, perinucleolar chromatin clearing, moderate nuclear atypia overall, scattered multinucleation, and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115272\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115272 \">picture 1</a>). Dermatologic and medical genetic consultation are advisable for patients having such neoplasms. This recommendation may be more strongly made when immunohistochemistry shows loss of fumarate hydratase; this type of testing is available at many laboratories, and its use is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some pathologists also perform fumarate hydratase immunohistochemistry on all atypical leiomyomas, as the phenotypic spectrum of HLRCC may be broader than first thought. (See <a href=\"#H23364055\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Rare exceptions to this may exist; a small case series reported that 3 of 18 women with cellular or atypical variants died of their disease; of note, there was a longer latency between diagnosis and death in these patients compared with those with leiomyosarcomas (&gt;6 years versus median of 2.1 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In our practice, we have seen several cases of tumors classified as an atypical leiomyoma develop into leiomyosarcomas in as few as four years. In addition, an atypical leiomyoma with deletions of 1p have expression profiles more similar to leiomyosarcomas than typical leiomyomas and myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Observations such as these are the foundation for the hypothesis that some atypical leiomyomas represent intermediate forms with the capacity to evolve into recognizable leiomyosarcomas.</p><p>The recurrence risk of leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei after myomectomy is about 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Management is the same as for women with smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential.

They are defined as having significantly more cellularity than the surrounding myometrium.</p><p>There is no discrete quantitative definition for hypercellularity, and application of the term varies somewhat across pathologists. No more than 5 percent of all leiomyomas within any given population should be designated as cellular. One useful working definition is visualization of recognizable basophilia, due to the increased number and density of nuclei when examining tissue sections without magnification. Another practical definition is to apply this diagnosis only to smooth muscle neoplasms with hypercellularity resembling endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS). In fact, care must be taken not to misclassify ESS as cellular leiomyomas.</p><p>The distinction of cellular leiomyomas from ESS is based on histological features, differences in immunophenotype, and presence of characteristic chromosomal rearrangements. The spindle cells of cellular leiomyomas are arranged in bundles (fascicles) whereas the cells of ESS are not bundled. Cellular leiomyomas, like all leiomyomas, have thick-walled vessels, but ESS lack such muscular vessels. In contrast, ESS cells wrap around numerous thin-walled vessels, recapitulating the relationship between normal endometrial stromal cells and spiral arterioles.</p><p>For diagnosis of cellular smooth muscle tumors, immunohistochemistry can be particularly helpful. Cellular leiomyomas express contractile proteins like smooth muscle actin, caldesmon, and desmin; ESS expresses <em>CD10</em> and <em>IFITM1</em>. Some of these biomarkers may be expressed in tumors of both cellular leiomyomas and ESS, though with different patterns; consequently, careful examination of a full panel is required to arrive at the correct assignment. Finally, solid tumor cytogenetics also may facilitate classification of challenging cases. Low-grade ESS and benign endometrial stromal nodules, the types most resembling cellular leiomyomas, have a characteristic recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(7;17)(p15;q21), involving <em>JAZF1</em> and <em>SUZ12</em> (formerly <em>JJAZ1</em>). Detection of <em>SUZ12</em> rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization is diagnostic for a stromal neoplasm.</p><p>Some evidence suggests that cellular leiomyomas, when distinguished by the loss of chromosome 1p, have a gene profile more similar to leiomyosarcomas than leiomyomas or normal myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additionally, in small clinical series, one with karyotype analysis, cellular leiomyomas were associated with aggressive clinical behavior, and the aggressive behavior was significantly associated with 1p deletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/22,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25-27</a>].</p><p>A histologic feature of cellular leiomyomas is the presence of thick-walled blood vessels, whereas ESS has vessels resembling the spiral arterioles of proliferative endometrium. Correct distinction between a cellular leiomyoma and ESS may require neoplasm phenotyping by immunohistochemistry. Cellular leiomyomas, like other smooth muscle neoplasms, typically express smooth muscle actin, desmin, and h-caldesmon. In contrast, ESS typically does not express these markers of smooth muscle differentiation, but generally expresses CD10 more strongly, diffusely, and frequently than cellular leiomyomas and other smooth muscle neoplasms, although neoplasms with mixed phenotypes occur.

Management of cellular leiomyomas is the same as for women with atypical leiomyomas.

Although any of the histologic variants of leiomyomas may be seen in IVL, the plexiform histologic pattern is common. (See <a href=\"#H1168074\" class=\"local\">'Plexiform leiomyomas'</a> above.)</p><p>IVL is diagnosed based upon pelvic imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging that shows a leiomyomatous uterus with projections into the vasculature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66678\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66678 \">image 1</a>); intracardiac evaluation is performed with cardiac echography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. Alternatively, the diagnosis is made following hysterectomy, when pathologic analysis reveals venous invasion and extension beyond the tumor mass from which IVL originates. The diagnosis can be further confirmed by cytogenetic evaluation of the involved tissue.

In such cases, the differential diagnosis includes ESS. Features that differentiate IVL from ESS are a lack of endometrial involvement, a lack of myometrial invasion, predominance of smooth muscle over endometrial stroma, a low mitotic index, and a lack of cytologic atypia. In addition to IVL and ESS, other abdominopelvic neoplasms noted for worm-like intravenous and intracaval extension include uterine leiomyosarcoma and renal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical phenotyping of the tumor with markers of smooth muscle (smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon), endometrial stromal (CD10), and epithelial (cytokeratins) differentiation is often helpful.</p><p>Treatment with surgical resection of the intravascular mass is required in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Because our current understanding of pathogenesis suggests contiguous spread from the uterus to the vascular tree, hysterectomy appears to be indicated at the time of surgical intervention. There are also reports of improvement in symptoms with use of medications that decrease estrogen levels (eg, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, aromatase inhibitors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Thus, post-treatment surveillance with abdominal or thoracic imaging is prudent. Accumulating evidence also suggests that IVL lesions may detach and travel hematogenously to the lung, where a lesion suggestive of benign metastasizing leiomyoma may form.

BML must be distinguished from lymphangioleiomyomatosis, which presents with histologically similar lung lesions. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, however, is characterized by destruction of the pulmonary interstitium by smaller, less circumscribed, and more numerous smooth muscle proliferations. Most cases of BML appear to follow a prior uterine surgery for uterine leiomyomas and clinical pathologic analysis suggests that the lung lesions are clonally derived from the benign uterine lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

One potential explanation for this geographical difference is that, given the traditionally high rate of hysterectomy in the United States, at-risk women may have had their uterus removed prior to the development of disease.</p><p>It appears the leiomyomas in women with HLRCC are more likely to be cellular or atypical and have peculiarly prominent nucleoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In fact, we now recommend dermatologic and medical genetic consultation for patients having tumors with the histological constellation prominent orangeophilic nucleoli, perinucleolar chromatin clearing, moderate nuclear atypia overall, scattered multinucleation, and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions.

It is associated with renal angiomyolipoma in 50 percent of sporadic cases, and 70 percent of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) will develop LAM.</p><p>LAM, however, is important to the differential diagnosis of leiomyoma variants for several reasons. First, LAM must be distinguished from so-called &quot;benign&quot; metastasizing leiomyomas. Both diseases may present with lung lesions that have a similar appearance on imaging studies. By pathology examination, benign metastasizing leiomyomas (BML) feature a well-circumscribed border with adjacent lung tissue, but LAM lesions diffusely infiltrate interstitial spaces in a manner that compromises lung function. Thus, BML requires only excision, but LAM ultimately may require lung transplantation. Second, both BML and LAM typically present in females of reproductive age. Third, LAM and uterine fibroids potentially may have overlapping pathogenetic mechanism(s). Dysregulation of the transcription factor HMGA2 has been reported in both diseases. In addition, in one animal model for uterine leiomyomas, the Eker rat, the leiomyomas are due to a spontaneous tuberous sclerosis gene (<em>TSC2</em>) mutation; germline mutation of one <em>TSC2</em> allele and loss of heterozygosity of the other <em>TSC2</em> allele result in LAM in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome#H462459902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;, section on 'Cowden syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12062357\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulvar and esophageal leiomyomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On chromosome Xq22.3, genes for the alpha-5 and alpha-6 monomers of no-fibrillar, basement membrane (type IV) collagen (<em>COL4A5</em> and <em>COL4A6</em>) are arranged in a head-to-head fashion and share a common promoter region. The X-linked form of Alport syndrome, defined by nephropathy, deafness, and sometimes ocular anomalies, results when <em>COL4A5</em> is mutated in germline DNA. Diffuse leiomyomatosis, typically manifesting as esophageal, tracheobronchial, or vulvar lesions, with Alport syndrome is due to germline deletion of both <em>COL4A5</em> and <em>COL4A6</em>, typifying the definition of a contiguous gene syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Pathogenetic, submicroscopic deletions of the overlapping promoters and adjacent 5' regions may be as small as 13.4 kb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Interestingly, the mRNA of <em>COL4A6</em> is increased about twofold in nonsyndromic (ie, typical &quot;garden variety&quot;) uterine leiomyomas, but decreased nearly 14-fold in uterine leiomyosarcomas relative to myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20798640\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of variants of uterine leiomyomas exist; these may vary because of extrauterine spread or occur as a primary extrauterine neoplasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may manifest some histologic facet of malignant neoplasms, but not enough to predict invasive behavior. (See <a href=\"#H20798632\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most concerning leiomyoma variants include smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), leiomyomas associated with heritable tumor predisposition (hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma [HLRCC] syndrome), and leiomyoma variants removed using a power morcellator without containment. (See <a href=\"#H1533068238\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine smooth muscle neoplasms are designated as malignant according to combinations of multiple histologic characteristics: abundant mitoses (&ge;10 per 10 high-power fields depending on other characteristics, or less if markedly cellular or atypical), prominent cellular atypia, areas of coagulative tumor cell necrosis, cellularity, myometrial invasion, and atypical mitoses. (See <a href=\"#H1166265\" class=\"local\">'Definition of benign versus malignant neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variants of leiomyomas that are confined to the uterus have the same clinical manifestations as benign leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas (ie, uterine mass, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure)</span>. There is no imaging modality that can reliably distinguish these lesions from other uterine neoplasms. Conditions that involve extrauterine disease have symptoms consistent with those disease sites (eg, lung and vena caval lesions may result in dyspnea). Many of these conditions are responsive to antiestrogenic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1167790\" class=\"local\">'Benign variants of leiomyomas'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1167264\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasms with extrauterine disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas include atypical, cellular, epithelioid, myxoid, hydropic, and dissecting leiomyomas. They are diagnosed following myomectomy or hysterectomy. Although their management is generally the same as ordinary leiomyomas, surveillance with pelvic imaging may be required. (See <a href=\"#H1167790\" class=\"local\">'Benign variants of leiomyomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>STUMP have some characteristics of sarcomas, but do not meet full diagnostic criteria. STUMP is diagnosed following myomectomy or hysterectomy. There are no definitive guidelines regarding whether hysterectomy, if not already performed, is required in women with this diagnosis, but careful follow-up is required at a minimum. (See <a href=\"#H3806712\" class=\"local\">'Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leiomyoma variants that include both uterine and extrauterine masses are characterized by histologic features essentially identical to benign uterine leiomyomas, but with spread to the pelvic veins and vena cava, peritoneal cavity, or other distant sites, such as the lungs. These conditions include leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata, intravenous leiomyomatosis, and benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis. (See <a href=\"#H1167264\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasms with extrauterine disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings suggestive of HLRCC, Cowden, or Alport syndrome should prompt referral to a genetic counselor due to risk of other disease in the individual or risk to family members. (See <a href=\"#H23364055\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23364224\" class=\"local\">'Cowden syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12062357\" class=\"local\">'Vulvar and esophageal leiomyomatosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Baird DD, Dunson DB, Hill MC, et al.
