The osteoporosis medication strontium ranelate is also associated to a risk of DRESS close to 1 per 10,000 exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4288289333\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacogenomics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacogenetic studies have found an association between HLA haplotypes and susceptibility to DRESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This has been demonstrated in many cases by positive patch test reactions and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. Among all phenotypes of cutaneous adverse drug reactions, DRESS is the one with strongest activation of drug-specific T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>During the acute phase of disease, there is an expansion of activated T lymphocytes in the blood, including both CD8 and CD4 cells that harbor activation markers and a skewed repertoire of the antigen receptor, and an expansion of regulatory T cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Type IV (T cell-mediated)'</a>). The latter has been suggested to contribute to virus reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50432117\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus reactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactivation of several viruses of the herpes group (human herpesvirus [HHV]-6, HHV-7, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and cytomegalovirus) is frequent in DRESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In a study of 100 patients with DRESS, an increase in the antibody titer against HHV-6 was detected in approximately 60 percent of patients two to four weeks after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay detected a significant amount of HHV-6 DNA in serum samples of approximately 30 percent of patients with increased anti-HHV-6 titers, indicating active viral replication in those patients. Disease relapses (eg, fever, hepatitis) were temporally related to the detection of HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood, suggesting that viral reactivation may contribute to the phenotype and severity of DRESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In another study including 40 patients with DRESS, evidence of EBV, HHV-6, or HHV-7 reactivation was found in 29 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. EBV-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>lymphocytes were found in the blood, skin, and liver of patients with DRESS, representing the normal response of the immune system to control virus reactivation.</p><p>These findings led to the hypothesis that the initial event in DRESS was a viral reactivation that induced the expansion of a T cell population cross-reacting with the drug and that tissue damage was caused by activated cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes directed against virus-related antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. However, since latent viruses can be harbored in humans by cells of the immune system (principally T lymphocytes and <span class=\"nowrap\">monocytes/macrophages),</span> the reactivation and release of viruses may be considered an early marker of stimulation of these cells, rather than the initiating event in the pathogenesis of DRESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Thus, DRESS is primarily a strong, drug-specific immune reaction that acts as a trigger of viral reactivation. Virus reactivation may contribute some symptoms or complications, but more studies are needed to clarify the respective role of viruses and drug-induced immune reaction in DRESS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872901\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy reveals a variable combination of spongiosis, acanthosis, interface vacuolization, a lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, predominantly perivascular, variable presence of eosinophils, and dermal edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].
