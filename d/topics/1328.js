Carefully performed randomized trials, technological advances, and better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms using intracardiac recordings and programmed electrical stimulation and mapping techniques have resulted in improved approaches to rhythm disturbances. Basic evaluation and management principles are key to the initial approach to the patient with an arrhythmia.</p><p>There are three reasons to evaluate and treat arrhythmias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminate symptoms and improve abnormal hemodynamics which can result from arrhythmias. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent imminent death and hemodynamic compromise due to a life-threatening arrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce possible risks other than the direct effects of the arrhythmia (eg, reduce stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation).</p><p/><p>This topic will provide an overview of early diagnosis and management of rhythm disturbances in patients who present to by primary care physicians. The reader will be referred to detailed discussions of the individual arrhythmias. The role of the primary care physician in the evaluation of palpitations is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An arrhythmia is any rhythm that is not normal sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Normal sinus rhythm originates from the sinus node in the upper portion of the right atrium. During sinus rhythm, the heart rate is in the normal range, the P waves are normal on the electrocardiogram (ECG), and the rate is stable.</p><p>The normal sinus rate at rest has been considered to be between 60 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. However, the range (defined by two standard deviations from the mean) is between 43 and 93 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> for men and 52 and 94 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> for women. Sinus bradycardia or tachycardia may be physiologic (ie, normal) or nonphysiologic (ie, abnormal); each is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-bradycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus bradycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-tachycardia-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus tachycardia: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not uncommonly, the activation rate of the sinus node varies, leading to a variable P-P interval on the ECG. If the variation of the P-P interval is 0.12 sec (120 msec) or more in the presence of normal P waves, this is known as sinus arrhythmia. Sinus arrhythmia is usually physiologic and is related to respiratory cycles. It does not require treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of atrioventricular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ECG documentation, age of the patient, and the clinical context in which the arrhythmia occurs are critical to the proper management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common arrhythmias encountered in an office-based setting include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial premature beats (APBs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74977\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74977 \">waveform 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78649\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78649 \">waveform 2</a>), including sinus bradycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78649\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78649 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65521\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65521 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69201%7ECARD%2F54513\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69201 graphicRef54513 \">waveform 3A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64217%7ECARD%2F75931\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64217 graphicRef75931 \">waveform 4A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVTs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56931\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56931 \">waveform 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54290 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrioventricular (AV) block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51492\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51492 \">waveform 6</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73299\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73299 \">waveform 7</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up of already treated VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF)</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of these arrhythmias may be difficult, even for an experienced specialist in rhythm disturbances. As an example, the etiology of wide or narrow QRS tachycardias may be difficult based upon the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some rhythm disturbances, such as symptomatic bradycardia (with syncope or near syncope) or sustained ventricular tachycardia, require urgent attention. Others, such as ectopic atrial and ventricular beats, may cause concern but do not need immediate management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248005419\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE PCP IN LONG-TERM CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the primary care physician (PCP) in the long-term care of patients with arrhythmias depends upon the particular arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment. All patients should be queried at each routine visit about changes in symptoms relevant to the arrhythmia and its treatment.</p><p>Patients with pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy are best followed periodically and evaluated by physicians knowledgeable in device programming, device characteristics, and their possible malfunction.</p><p>Patients prescribed antiarrhythmic drug therapy are generally followed by a cardiologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac electrophysiologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically seek medical care for symptoms associated with an arrhythmia. They may also request or require evaluation if there are other abnormalities that place a patient at risk for an arrhythmia, such as a delta wave or a long QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy seen by an echocardiogram. Occasionally, an asymptomatic patient who has an irregular pulse on examination, or who has an ECG, ambulatory monitor, or exercise test for another reason is found to have an arrhythmia or evidence that may indicate an arrhythmia may be present.</p><p>The initial evaluation of the patient with an arrhythmia consists of a complete history (aimed toward symptoms and timing of the arrhythmia and potential underlying diseases), physical examination, and 12-lead ECG, if possible, during the arrhythmia and without it. The ECG alone during the arrhythmia may determine the type of arrhythmia and whether a particular symptom is related to the arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence and type of symptoms may determine whether any action needs to be taken. Symptoms may be related to the arrhythmia (eg, palpitations) or due to the hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmias (eg, dyspnea, dizziness).</p><p>Symptoms caused by cardiac arrhythmias can mimic those due to other medical disorders and include palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, chest discomfort, neck discomfort, dyspnea, weakness, and anxiety. Secondary consequences of arrhythmias, often due to underlying heart disease, are an additional source of symptoms (eg, congestive heart failure, ischemia, and thromboemboli).</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias can have unusual symptomatic presentations such as tinnitus, visual changes, increased urinary frequency, abdominal discomfort, and peripheral edema. Arrhythmias may cause a change in sympathetic and vagal tone, hormonal changes, elevation of venous pressure, and reduced cardiac output, all of which can lead to an even longer list of other symptoms.</p><p>Symptom type and severity are related to the etiology and rate of the arrhythmia, to the nature and severity of underlying heart disease, and to the patient. The symptom severity often dictates the urgency for therapy or even the need to evaluate and treat. The presence of structural heart disease is a key issue that determines the urgency of intervention, evaluation, therapy, and the prognostic importance of the arrhythmia.</p><p>Arrhythmias commonly cause palpitations. The approach to the patient who presents with palpitations is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-palpitations-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of palpitations in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the history and physical exam may strongly suggest the diagnosis, such as in a patient with lightheadedness and a rapid and irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation), the diagnosis requires documentation with an electrocardiogram or a monitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrioventricular block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-basic-principles-of-ecg-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Basic principles of ECG analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-intraventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Intraventricular block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-rhythms-and-arrhythmias-of-the-sinus-node\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Rhythms and arrhythmias of the sinus node&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-ventricular-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Ventricular arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with a suspected arrhythmia have a paroxysmal pattern, so that the ECG recorded in the absence of symptoms is either normal or does not suggest a specific arrhythmia. Four types of outpatient monitoring systems are available (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional Holter &ndash; Continuous recording of ECG, usually for 24 or 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Event recorder &ndash; Patient activated recorder, although some newer models have automatic arrhythmia detection software to store asymptomatic episodes. Data is transmitted over the phone to a monitoring station.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobile continuous outpatient cardiac telemetry &ndash; Continuous recording and analysis, with symptomatic or algorithm defined episodes transmitted automatically via cellular technology to monitoring station.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implantable loop recorder &ndash; Patient and algorithm defined episodes stored in device, until interrogated either in office or remotely via home equipment and internet.</p><p/><p>Ambulatory monitoring to assess for arrhythmia is frequently indicated in the evaluation of patients with syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-management-for-the-primary-care-clinician/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>An event recorder or transtelephonic monitor can help make the diagnosis in a patient with less frequent palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arrhythmia-management-for-the-primary-care-clinician/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Transtelephonic ECG devices exist in several forms of recorders and transmitters capable of direct transmission of an electrocardiogram as an audio signal by telephone. These ECG signals are most commonly received at a base station equipped with a demodulator and an ECG strip chart recorder. Although such devices usually provide limited, noncontinuous sample ECG data, the device may be used in either a noncontinuous or continuous format.</p><p>Transtelephonic devices with memory that record and are applied non-continuously are small (beeper size), lightweight instruments that are generally inexpensive. These devices are carried by the patient; they can be applied with temporary contact to the precordial area, or are attached by electrodes and worn continuously. The memory feature allows recording of data without the need for immediate access to telephone transmission.</p><p>Transtelephonic monitoring includes wrist recorders whose circuitry is completed by contact of the index finger and thumb, or hand contact to the opposite wrist. This action results in the loop storage of a four- to five-minute ECG sample of lead I, and permits direct printout or transtelephonic transmission. The stored data may be transmitted by telephone directly to a facsimile machine. An implantable monitor (Reveal, Medtronic, Minneapolis, United States) is available in Europe and will be available soon in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>New patch monitors have become available that can record over a period of several weeks of data. Further use of smart phone may be in the process of revolutionizing external recording techniques.</p><p>If episodes are associated with exercise or physical or mental stress or when an arrhythmia cannot be documented with ambulatory or transtelephonic monitoring, a treadmill or bicycle ergometer may be helpful to establish the presence and mechanism of the arrhythmia.</p><p>In some instances, such as in selected patients with unexplained syncope, an implantable loop recorder may be indicated to detect the arrhythmia that may be responsible for patient symptoms based on the correlation between the symptoms and the recorded arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;, section on 'Implantable loop recorder'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients identified with an arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For any patient with a diagnosed arrhythmia, several questions should be considered and hopefully answered in short order: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which arrhythmia(s) is present? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the arrhythmia pose an immediate or long-term risk to the patient?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the arrhythmia well-tolerated (based on symptoms and blood pressure)? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the arrhythmia require immediate intervention, such as medical therapy or cardioversion? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient require urgent hospitalization for the arrhythmia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated underlying conditions (eg, underlying heart disease)? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is specialist consultation required, and if so, when? &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other medical therapy be started and when? </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4234101107\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic arrhythmias rarely require urgent treatment but may indicate long-term risk. In such patients, a physician may choose to refer the patient on an elective basis to a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist. However, an understanding of the rhythm disturbance is mandatory. Additionally, the arrhythmias needs to be understood in light of any underlying medical diagnosis. For example, occasional asymptomatic PVCs may have little importance in young, otherwise healthy individuals but may portend a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702368745\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are symptomatic in the office, it becomes important to glean the best testing strategy based on an understanding of the suspected cause for the symptoms and symptom severity. The management strategy will depend both on the characteristics of the symptoms and the type of arrhythmia present if diagnosed. </p><p>In the following clinical scenarios, we recommend urgent transfer to a facility with emergency care capabilities: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope or near syncope in patients with high degree AV block or bradycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide complex sustained rhythms (other than sinus with bundle branch block) including ventricular tachycardia especially if not well tolerated or associated with hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain after examination and ECG, but for whom there is a concern about a life-threatening arrhythmia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a history of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure and syncope, near syncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> documented ventricular arrhythmia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid or slow rates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmias associated with chest pain, dyspnea or congestive heart failure</p><p/><p>Emergent cardioversion is not indicated for any conscious patient, including those with ventricular tachycardia, except if it is associated with hemodynamic compromise (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;80 mmHg). However, urgent cardioversion may be required if the rhythm is not tolerated well. Cardioversion has risks and should not be undertaken if there is a risk of a thromboembolic event that could be precipitated by electrical shock. Such may be the case for a patient who is not adequately anticoagulated and in atrial fibrillation for more than 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Referral to a specialist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmias such as isolated atrial premature beats (APBs) or ventricular premature beats (VPBs), or atrial fibrillation are common in the general population and many primary care physicians are comfortable and capable of managing patients with these. We suggest elective referral to a cardiologist for the following patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient with an arrhythmia when the primary care physician is uncomfortable with either diagnosis or management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for permanent pacing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with an uncertain diagnosis, prognosis, or management strategy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who might benefit from implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or biventricular pacemaker.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who might benefit from a catheter ablation procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who might benefit from antiarrhythmic drug therapy (eg, particularly patients with structural heart disease). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy for any arrhythmia is to improve symptoms and to prevent a potentially serious outcome, primarily a life-threatening arrhythmia and sudden death. Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is also an important treatment objective. The decision to initiate a long-term treatment strategy, whether it be with device or drug therapy, depends upon the severity and frequency of arrhythmia-related symptoms compared to the risks associated with the therapy itself.</p><p>The need for long-term therapy must be carefully individualized to each patient since the severity and importance of symptoms are highly variable. The symptoms associated with any arrhythmia can have an impact on lifestyle, occupation, driving, and other important daily activities.</p><p>In most cases, initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy will be by a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist. Pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and biventricular devices are generally implanted by electrophysiologists or other physicians with special training and certification in their placement. The ability to interrogate the devices long term is also necessary. The long-term follow-up of patients with implanted devices also requires special training and expertise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiarrhythmic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the involvement of a specialist (cardiologist or electrophysiologist) when initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug is considered. Antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to increase premature ventricular contractions or induce or aggravate monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation (VF), conduction disturbances, or bradycardia. This phenomenon is known as proarrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66133 \">table 3</a>). The potential for major adverse outcomes, including death, requires the expertise of a specialist who understands the use and risks of these drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of proarrhythmia is higher for class I drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 4</a>) in patients with structural heart disease, especially coronary heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular dysfunction, than in patients with structurally normal heart disease. Class II drugs (beta blockers, except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, which also has class III properties at higher dosing), have no tachyarrhythmic or proarrhythmic effects but can cause bradycardia. Class III drugs prolong repolarization and pose the specific risk of torsades de pointes or ventricular tachycardia.</p><p>Although the exact incidence of proarrhythmia is not certain, it appears to be relatively low when antiarrhythmic drugs are used carefully and properly. The risk varies according to the type of arrhythmia treated, the presence of structural heart disease, the QT interval, pre-existing conduction disturbances, sinus node dysfunction, patient age, the presence of heart failure, and left and right ventricular function. The proarrhythmic risk is highest in patients with depressed left ventricular function (eg, ejection fraction [EF] &lt;0.30), the group at highest risk for an arrhythmic event and sudden death and in case of ionic disturbance (hypokalemia); the risk is lowest in those with no organic heart disease.</p><p>Proarrhythmia can be predictable and is most often idiosyncratic. However, it may be dose-related for specific drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, class IC drugs, and the metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, N-acetyl procainamide.</p><p>Torsades de pointes is the most recognized form of drug proarrhythmia. It is characterized by a VT with a twisting of the peaks of the QRS complexes across an imaginary isoelectric line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827%7ECARD%2F60231\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 graphicRef60231 \">waveform 8A-C</a>). The QT interval is prolonged, bradycardia is often present, and the arrhythmia is induced after a short-long cycle. Torsades de pointes was originally recognized as a complication of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> use, being the mechanism for &quot;quinidine syncope.&quot; Many non-antiarrhythmic drugs, including some antibiotics, antipsychotics, and other classes of drugs, can increase the risk of torsades de pointes via prolongation of the QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72631 \">table 5</a>).

For example, the labeling information for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> specify inpatient initiation, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> can generally be initiated outside the hospital in appropriate patients.</p><p/><p>Following the initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug, patients should have periodic monitoring with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests. The frequency of such tests is higher at the time of initiation and dose adjustment. Careful monitoring of electrolytes may help reduce the risk of proarrhythmia. Assessment of renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic function is also important depending on the agent(s) being used. These drugs may interact with other drugs, which also require monitoring (for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> tends to increase the International Normalized Ratio [INR] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> level)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> should have assessment of hepatic, thyroid, and pulmonary function on a regular basis, or with any symptoms that suggest possible organ toxicity. Patients taking amiodarone should also be cautioned regarding skin photosensitivity. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC ARRHYTHMIAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial fibrillation and flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding discussion has emphasized the symptoms (eg, palpitations, syncope) and life-threatening potential of an arrhythmia itself. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter are associated with additional therapeutic issues, each of which must be addressed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversion to sinus rhythm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of sinus rhythm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowing the ventricular rate in persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of systemic embolization and stroke, both at the time of reversion and in patients chronically.</p><p/><p>These issues are discussed in detail separately.

APBs are observed on the surface electrocardiogram as a P wave that occurs relatively early in the cardiac cycle (ie, prematurely before the next sinus P wave should occur) and has a different morphology from the sinus P wave. Often the PR interval is different from that during sinus rhythm; it may be longer or shorter, depending upon the site of origin of the APB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>APBs may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as a sensation of &quot;skipping&quot; or palpitations. APBs are often single and isolated, but may be frequent and may occur in a bigeminal (every other beat) or other repeated pattern. A <span class=\"nowrap\">trigger/stimulant</span> is often identified and its removal may eliminate or significantly reduce symptoms. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy, aside from beta blockers, is rarely recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p>APB's may be blocked in the A-V conducting system. This is not necessarily pathologic, and it needs to be differentiated from atrioventricular block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular premature beats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs) are common in the general population and often cause patients to seek medical attention. This includes patients without structural heart disease and those with any form of cardiac disease, independent of severity. The evaluation and management of VPBs is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs-for-ventricular-arrhythmias-in-patients-with-a-prior-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of antiarrhythmic drugs for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with a prior myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIA IN ATHLETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmias are not infrequently documented in athletes and can be a source of morbidity and mortality, particularly ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

During sinus rhythm, the heart rate is in the normal range, the P waves are normal on the electrocardiogram (ECG), the AV conduction is normal, and the rate is stable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p>When the primary care clinician first encounters a patient with an arrhythmia, the following questions should be addressed (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the arrhythmia causing symptoms or could it?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the arrhythmia pose a risk to the patient?
