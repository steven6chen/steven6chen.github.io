In most cases, there is a secondary cause, such as an anatomic abnormality or established systemic illness. However, secondary immune defects due to other medical disorders are sometimes identified, while primary immune defects presenting in adults are rare. The initial approach to an adult patient with recurrent infections is discussed here, with a discussion of the nonimmunologic disorders that should be considered in the evaluation of recurrent infection at specific anatomic sites and a brief overview of immunodeficiency in adults. The laboratory tests that are used to evaluate the various components of the immune system are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, recurrent infections are usually due to an anatomic lesion, a functional disorder, or to a secondary cause of immunosuppression.</p><p>It is helpful to consider the following broad categories of etiologies when evaluating an adult with recurrent infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic lesions, whether congenital or acquired, and disorders affecting the function of specific organs are important causes of recurrent infections in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87023 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary immune disorders due to other medical conditions or treatments for these conditions are a much more common cause of recurrent infections than primary immunodeficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71244 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8541352\" class=\"local\">'Secondary immunodeficiency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most congenital (primary) immunodeficiencies do not present in adulthood but rather are diagnosed in infancy or childhood, because patients with these disorders often require repeated hospitalizations for serious infections at an early age and may develop growth retardation from chronic and recurrent illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. However, the number of recognized immunodeficiencies has expanded dramatically in recent decades, and primary immunodeficiency is probably not as rare as previously thought. In addition, there are increasing reports of milder phenotypes of disorders that were previously recognized only in the most severe forms (eg, DiGeorge syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H8541589\" class=\"local\">'Primary immunodeficiency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of an adult with recurrent infections begins with a complete history and thorough physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8541745\"><span class=\"h2\">History and documentation of infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history should include a careful review of the patients' past medical problems and their treatments, surgeries, accidental injuries, and medications. Culture information and imaging studies documenting the presence of infections and types of organisms should be retrieved or obtained for past and current infections, whenever possible. The etiology and subsequent approach varies according to the type and pattern of infections present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4545049\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of a patient with a history of recurrent infections may reveal anatomic abnormalities or signs and stigmata of significant underlying disorders (eg, venous insufficiency). Patients with longstanding immune defects may display low body mass index (BMI), sequelae of recurrent infection in the form of scarring (of tympanic membranes or skin), signs of chronic lung disease (chronic cough, absent gag reflex, clubbing, crackles, or wheezing to suggest bronchiectasis), or ongoing infection (signs of chronic sinusitis, oral thrush, warts, or dermatophyte infections). Lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatosplenomegaly can be seen with antibody deficiencies, as can arthritic changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8541765\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed family history is important for the detection of primary immunodeficiencies. Severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent febrile illnesses or infections or childhood deaths in relatives may suggest an X-linked or autosomal recessive immune disorder. Consanguinity increases the likelihood that a rare autosomal recessive condition could be expressed. Multiple family members with autoimmune diseases or malignancies should also raise the suspicion of a familial immune disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSIDERATIONS BY SITE OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients will sometimes present with recurrent infections of one type. In this setting, there are specific nonimmunologic conditions which should be considered before an immune evaluation is undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin infections, in isolation, are not usually indicative of an underlying primary immunodeficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112541945\"><span class=\"h3\">Impetigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is often complicated by recurrent staphylococcal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> streptococcal impetigo, presumably due to the disruption of the intact epidermal layer. Cutaneous viral infections due to herpes simplex, vaccinia, and coxsackie virus are also associated with underlying eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Cellulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellulitis is likely to recur in the setting of lymphatic stasis (lymphedema) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> breaches in the skin barrier (eg, dermatophyte infections or trauma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphedema can be classified as primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired) disease. Lymphedema in adults is most often due to axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation, and such patients have an increased risk of cellulitis. Patients from endemic areas may present with lymphedema as a sequela of filariasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis following pelvic lymph node dissection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cellulitis-and-other-skin-disorders-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cellulitis and other skin disorders of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A previous episode of cellulitis itself can lead to lymphatic scarring and impaired lymphatic drainage, thereby promoting the development of recurrent cellulitis. This has been best described after saphenous venectomy for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H26418523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Post-venectomy cellulitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatophyte infections can predispose patients to recurrent cellulitis, especially when tinea pedis develops after saphenous venectomy. The dermatophyte infection provides a portal of entry for bacteria, most often streptococci or staphylococci, and predisposes to the development of cellulitis. The frequency of infections in these patients is often reduced by treatment of dermatophyte infections and other primary dermatologic conditions, meticulous podiatric care, and consideration of antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H26418523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Post-venectomy cellulitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic edema also increases the risk of recurrent cellulitis. Venous insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hepatic disease, and nephrotic syndrome are all causes of chronic edema that predispose patients to recurrent cellulitis. These underlying diagnoses should be considered during the evaluation of recurrent cellulitis in patients with unexplained edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral arterial disease with ischemia is associated with an increased risk of recurrent skin infection in the affected limbs. The presence of ischemic ulcers provides a ready portal of entry for progressive local infection, exacerbated by poor arterial inflow and delivery of granulocytes and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity has also been reported as a risk factor for recurrent cellulitis. It is possible that lower extremity venous stasis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphatic stasis due to hydrostatic issues in these individuals is responsible for their increased risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical evaluation of the obese child and adolescent&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent abscess formation in the same anatomic location often arises from a local defect, such as a congenital branchial cleft cyst, pilonidal or urachal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or a retained foreign body. In these situations, recurrent infection is limited to the neck, axilla, groin, umbilicus, or site of previous trauma, and there is no need to suspect a generalized susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, Crohn disease can lead to inguinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perianal abscesses, complicating enteric fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess formation. Inflammatory bowel disease occasionally coexists with antibody deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with risk factors for acquired immunosuppressive conditions predisposing to infection (such as diabetes or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) should undergo screening for these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple or recurrent abscesses in a variety of locations may be the result of autoinoculation in the setting of drug abuse (subcutaneous drug injection or &quot;skin-popping&quot;) or Munchausen syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Qualitative granulocyte disorders rarely present with recurrent abscesses in adults, but acquired quantitative granulocyte disorders (myelofibrosis and other causes of progressive marrow failure) may develop in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemic of community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) infection involving strains related to clone USA300 has led to a striking increase in the number of individuals with recurrent superficial skin abscesses. These patients are otherwise well, and immunologic evaluation can generally be restricted to those with recurrent deep infections (pyomyositis, skeletal infection, necrotizing pneumonia, etc). Preventive measures for reducing the spread of staphylococci may be helpful for reducing the risk for recurrent skin infection and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-prevention-and-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Prevention and control&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1511872587\"><span class=\"h3\">Mucocutaneous candidiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common candidal infections include oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush), esophagitis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis, and mastitis in lactating women. Typical presentations and predisposing factors are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-candida-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Candida infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMCC) is a rare syndrome affecting the skin, oral and genital mucosal surfaces, lips, and nails with persistent infection and striking dystrophic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64895 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71698\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71698 \">picture 2</a>). It usually begins in childhood and is seen in association with several underlying immunologic disorders. Candidal infections rarely become systemic in CMCC, which distinguishes this disorder from the systemic infections seen with more profound T cell immunodeficiencies. Referral for immunologic evaluation is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-mucocutaneous-candidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198241626\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent herpes simplex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe oral, cutaneous, or genital herpes infections are often referred for formal infectious diseases consultation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hallmark of herpes group virus infections is persistent (latent) neuronal viral infection, with the risk of recurrent regional disease throughout life. The frequency of recurrence varies widely among different individuals (from one or two episodes over a lifetime to approximately one episode monthly) and is likely determined by multiple factors, including age at the time of primary infection, age at the time of recurrence (immunologic immaturity in infancy, waning immune protection in advanced age), viral strain variations, inflammatory triggers in the distribution of the latently-infected neurons, and underlying host diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Recurrent infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with occasional recurrences respond well to episodic treatment with antiviral therapies, self-administered at the first sign of recurrence. Patients with very frequent recurrences, a problem seen during the first few years after primary infection in some individuals, may be offered maintenance suppression therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;, section on 'Recurrent infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Treatment strategies for recurrent disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocompetent individuals usually experience satisfactory control with episodic or maintenance suppression. In contrast, immunodeficient patients may develop refractory or progressive primary infection or very frequent relapses despite appropriate antiviral therapy. These individuals should be evaluated for underlying T or natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction, although in many instances, the underlying immunologic disorders are known at the time of presentation with severe herpes simplex. (See <a href=\"#H1217342898\" class=\"local\">'Initial immunologic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In patients with recurrent or severe outbreaks, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of herpes simplex, preferably by direct immunofluorescence, viral culture, or serology, depending upon available laboratory resources. Two disorders that may mimic recurrent herpes simplex are nonherpetic aphthous ulcers, which often respond to topical corticosteroids, and recurrent herpes zoster, which may become less frequent following administration of the zoster vaccine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent aphthous stomatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973496964\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent herpes zoster</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than one episode of herpes zoster is uncommon but not rare in an immunocompetent individual. In a population-based study, Mayo Clinic investigators demonstrated a recurrence rate of 5.7 percent over an eight-year follow-up of immunocompetent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, zoster can be recurrent in patients with HIV infection. Herpes simplex occurring outside of the mouth, lips, and genitals can also be mistaken for herpes zoster, so it is desirable to confirm the type of infection. Recurrent zoster is reviewed separately.

These disorders are rare in general and present with combinations of skin and respiratory tract infections. Tissue and organ focal infections (phlegmon, granuloma, or abscess) also occur. Other frequent manifestations include abnormal wound healing, <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatitis/eczema,</span> and stomatitis. Referral to an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergist/immunologist</span> or infectious diseases specialist would be prudent to help guide further testing.

However, recurrent sinusitis in isolation is occasionally seen in the less severe antibody deficiencies, including specific antibody deficiency, immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency, and selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency.</p><p>Inadequate antibiotic therapy is a common cause of apparent recurrent sinusitis and may arise from treatment that is either too brief or too narrow in its spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Patients may report multiple episodes of sinusitis over the course of several months. However, on careful questioning, the clinician can detect a pattern of improvement on antibiotics, with gradual return of symptoms within the first two weeks after completing therapy and then worsening to the point that another course of antibiotics was prescribed. This pattern suggests a single relapsing infection rather than multiple new infections.</p><p>In contrast, adult patients with recurrent or chronic sinus infections, in combination with lower respiratory tract infections or recurrent otitis media, may have a defect in antibody production or function, such as common variable immunodeficiency, IgG subclass deficiencies, or specific antibody deficiency with polysaccharide nonresponsiveness.

Molecular analyses of symptomatic patients show persistence of individual isolates rather than serial infection by independent strains. Once adequate medication adherence is ensured, symptomatic patients with recurrent pharyngitis often benefit from the use of a beta-lactamase-resistant agent. In some individuals, beta-lactamase production by oral flora is associated with penicillin failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some patients are (noninvasive) carriers of pharyngeal group A streptococci and have positive throat cultures for group A streptococci when they are cultured in the setting of viral respiratory tract infections. Antibody screening for antistreptococcal antibodies (antistreptolysin O [ASLO] and anti-DNase B) may be helpful, since carriers of group A streptococci typically have low antibody titers.

A fundamental function of the immune system is to distinguish &quot;self&quot; from &quot;nonself.&quot; This capacity is critical not only for defense against invading micro-organisms but also for the prevention of autoimmune disease and detection and destruction of malignant cells. Some immunodeficiencies are also associated with higher rates of allergic disease, which is another manifestation of immune dysregulation.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders that are seen in patients with immunodeficiencies include autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, pernicious anemia, celiac disease, and vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
