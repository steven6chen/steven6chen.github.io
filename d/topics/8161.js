The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). A virus causes this disease. The virus is called the hepatitis C virus. It spreads from person to person through contact with blood. This can happen in a few ways, like sharing drug needles or having sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780800\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of hunger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle or joint aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>In most cases, hepatitis C lasts for many years. That can lead to liver scarring, called &quot;cirrhosis.&quot; Many people with cirrhosis have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the belly and legs, and fluid build-up in the lungs </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising or bleeding easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble taking in a full breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full in the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion that can come on suddenly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coma</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780807\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get the disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can catch the hepatitis C virus if you have contact with the blood of someone who is infected. This can happen if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share drug needles or cocaine straws</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use infected needles for tattooing, acupuncture, or piercings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share toothbrushes, razors, or other things that could have blood on them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Got a blood transfusion in the United States before 1990 (after that time, blood banks started testing donated blood for hepatitis C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have sex with someone who is infected</p><p/><p>A pregnant woman who is infected can also give hepatitis C to her baby.</p><p>Some people who have hepatitis C do not remember how they were infected. In the United States, many people with hepatitis C were born between 1945 and 1965. If you were born during these years, your doctor might want to test you for hepatitis C even if you did not do any of the things that put you at risk of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780814\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hepatitis C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor might order a few tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests can show:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you have hepatitis C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What type of the virus you have (there are at least 6 types)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Which treatment will work best for you</p><p/><p>If you have hepatitis C, your doctor will also want to know if you have any liver scarring. Ways to check for scarring include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver scan &ndash; This is a type of imaging test that can show how much scarring you have. Not all doctors have access to the machine that does the scan.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a needle into your liver and takes out a small sample of tissue. The sample will show how bad the damage is.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780821\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hepatitis C treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what type of hepatitis C you have. There are different medicines to treat hepatitis C. Some of them only work on certain forms of the hepatitis C virus. You will have to take a combination of 2 or more medicines based on which virus you have. Treatment usually lasts 3 to 6 months. The medicines come in pill form.</p><p>Some of the medicines used to treat hepatitis C are not appropriate for pregnant women, or for men or women who are not using reliable birth control. Before you start treatment, ask your doctor whether you need to be on reliable birth control for the treatment he or she suggests. Your doctor can help you decide if these medicines are right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780828\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to protect my liver?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a healthy weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get vaccinated for pneumonia, the flu, and other diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse before taking any over-the-counter pain medicines (these medicines can sometimes damage the liver).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid marijuana</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780835\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse first. About 1 in 20 women who have hepatitis C pass the virus on to the baby during pregnancy. That number goes up in women who are also infected with HIV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780842\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with hepatitis C are able to live normal lives. Treatment can cure the disease in many cases.</p><p>If you have hepatitis C, it is still safe to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hug, kiss, and touch other people (but you can spread the infection through sex)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share forks, spoons, cups, and food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneeze or cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780849\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
