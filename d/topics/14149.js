With advances in prenatal ultrasound, many of these anomalies are now identified before birth. The etiology is diverse and includes environmental factors, genetic factors, or a combination of both.</p><p>As the landscape of genetic testing rapidly evolves, clinicians are often left with many questions about the most appropriate testing methods to use for their patients. This topic will provide a reasonable approach to the genetic evaluation of an anomalous fetus. Postnatal evaluation of the anomalous infant is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3477481339\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY OF CHROMOSOME ABNORMALITIES IN ANOMALOUS FETUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding of a fetal structural anomaly increases the possibility of a chromosome abnormality or genetic molecular defect and should prompt further evaluation into genetic etiologies. The frequency of a chromosome abnormality depends on the specific anomaly, the number of anomalies, and the combination of anomalies identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In several retrospective series of prenatally detected anomalies on ultrasound that prompted genetic studies, an isolated fetal anomaly was associated with fetal chromosome abnormalities in 2 to 18 percent of cases; multiple anomalies were associated with a fetal chromosome abnormality in 13 to 35 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030458772\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085626172\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We offer a diagnostic procedure to patients with structural fetal abnormalities on ultrasound examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108719\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108719 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The goal is to determine whether there is a genetic etiology of the abnormalities that would enable well-informed counseling about prognosis, reproductive options, obstetric and pediatric management, and recurrence risks.</p><p>The decision to undergo invasive testing is personal and must be based on the individual patient's values and goals. Pretest counseling by a provider familiar with the suspected fetal diagnoses and with genetic testing options is necessary for patients to make informed decisions. Alternatives to prenatal diagnostic testing include prenatal screening and postnatal diagnostic testing.</p><p>Depending on the gestational age at the time of diagnosis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be offered to obtain a fetal specimen for genetic testing. CVS is typically performed between 10 and 13 weeks of gestation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a>). Amniocentesis is optimally completed after 15 weeks of gestation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a>). When performed at a high-volume, experienced center, the pregnancy loss rate for amniocentesis is approximately 1 in 300 to 1 in 1000 (0.1 to 0.3 percent), with similar procedure-related loss rates for CVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>For an anomalous fetus with sonographic features consistent with a common trisomy</strong>, the authors' practice is to begin the genetic evaluation with interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the major aneuploidies (chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;</a>). The FISH results are typically available in 24 to 48 hours compared with the 7 to 10 days needed for G-banded karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Although FISH provides a rapid result, it also adds to the cost of the fetal evaluation, so it is also reasonable to proceed directly to G-banded karyotype or CMA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the FISH is abnormal, the results should be confirmed with a G-banded karyotype. Although FISH on amniocytes is accurate, we recommend confirming abnormal FISH results with karyotype in order to determine if the aneuploidy detected is secondary to an unbalanced translocation (representing a risk for a balanced translocation in a parent) or nondisjunction. (See <a href=\"#H1704211276\" class=\"local\">'Fluorescent in situ hybridization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the FISH is normal, we offer chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) instead of a G-banded karyotype as we believe this approach allows for the highest diagnostic yield. CMA can be performed on the same fetal specimen used for FISH. Before proceeding with CMA, all patients meet with a certified genetic counselor to review possible results and test limitations. (See <a href=\"#H1977182457\" class=\"local\">'Karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>For an anomalous fetus with sonographic features that do not primarily suggest a common trisomy</strong>, the authors begin the genetic evaluation with CMA. Our approach is the same whether the anomaly appears to be isolated or multiple structural anomalies are observed. While studies have suggested that the risk for chromosome abnormalities or genetic syndromes is higher when multiple anomalies are present, we believe that an isolated anomaly still warrants a thorough investigation when desired by the patient. Furthermore, an apparently isolated anomaly on prenatal ultrasound may not be isolated when the newborn is evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H1977182457\" class=\"local\">'Karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients interested in pursuing additional genetic testing, we review available testing options and, when appropriate, suggest targeted gene sequencing and gene panels instead of whole exome sequencing (WES). The targeted approach reduces some of the risk of finding genomic variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) or incidental findings. Additionally, the turnaround time of such tests is typically shorter. We anticipate that this is an area that will change significantly in coming years as our understanding of WES expands. (See <a href=\"#H2558272566\" class=\"local\">'Gene sequencing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2253839481\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1704211276\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluorescent in situ hybridization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal trisomies for 21, 18, and 13; sex chromosome aneuploidy; and triploidy account for 80 percent of clinically significant chromosomal conditions diagnosed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used for rapid and accurate detection of aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y, with results typically available in 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The positive predictive value for FISH is high, reported to be 100 percent for trisomies 21, 18, and 13, and 98.5 percent for 45,X [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, confirmatory testing with G-banded karyotype is required to determine if a translocation is present. Normal FISH results also require additional testing, either through G-banded karyotype or CMA, as alternations in chromosome structure and less common aneuploidies would be missed if FISH was used in isolation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1977182457\"><span class=\"h3\">Karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>G-banded karyotyping has been the standard for prenatal diagnosis, but use of CMA is increasing. CMA detects small (10 to 100 kb) gains and losses of genetic material (called copy number variants [CNV]) that would not be identified by traditional karyotyping yet have the potential to lead to significant phenotypic abnormalities. In contrast, G-banded karyotyping has a resolution of only 5 to 10 Mb, which is far larger. Additionally, CMA does not require cell culture, which reduces the turnaround time for results.</p><p>In a 2014 systematic review of prenatal CMA, a clinically significant CNV was detected in 5.6 percent (95% CI 4.7-6.6) of fetuses with an ultrasound anomaly restricted to one anatomical system and a normal karyotype and in 9.1 percent (95% CI 7.5-10.8 percent) of fetuses with multiple anomalies and a normal karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These estimates are similar to other reviews where significant CNV in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies and normal karyotype ranged from 5.1 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The greater depth of molecular analysis with CMA increases the likelihood of a diagnosis, but is accompanied by identification of background variability and genetic diseases not associated with the fetal anomaly being evaluated (ie, incidental findings), which increases the complexity of prenatal counseling. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variants of unknown significance &ndash; The possibility and implications of variants of unknown significance (VUS) should be discussed. Many individuals will have variation in their DNA when analyzed at the level of CMA. For most individuals, curation of the CMA variant through large databases, population studies, and literature review can determine its significance, ie, its benign or pathologic nature. In others, finding the CMA variant in one of the parents helps to determine its possible significance. For the remainder, VUS results represent a finding unique to the individual tested. In a systematic review, VUS were detected in 2.1 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.3) of cases when the indication for CMA was abnormal ultrasound findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The distress associated with the uncertainty of a VUS is often amplified in the prenatal setting, especially when patients are making decisions about pregnancy termination. In a qualitative study of women who had received an abnormal prenatal CMA, patients expressed the anguish that came with the uncertainty of their results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For this reason, the authors suggested assessing the patient's tolerance for uncertainty before proceeding with this testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal CMA and the work-up of VUS may lead to identification of genetic changes in one or both parents or identification of fetal genes associated with adult onset diseases. For example, one or both parents may be found to be carriers of a genetic disease, genetic conditions with an onset in later life, and inherited predispositions to cancer. In one study, assessment of CMA in fetuses with anomalies revealed cancer predisposition genes in 0.92 percent of individuals tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p>While CMA has improved resolution over G-banded karyotype, this technique will not identify all genetic changes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene sequence changes that might affect gene function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triploidy if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis is not included; however, most prenatal CMA platforms are now based on SNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balanced chromosome rearrangements (detectable by standard karyotype); in some cases, when the translocation is occurring for the first time in the fetus, an abnormal phenotype can result due to disruption of genes at the breakpoints of the translocation. Therefore, if an abnormality is detected by CMA, further cytogenetic investigation by G-banded karyotype may be necessary to determine if a structural chromosome abnormality, such as an unbalanced translocation, is present that may have been inherited from a healthy carrier parent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-level tissue mosaicism.</p><p/><p>Many professional societies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, have recommended use of CMA for prenatal diagnosis. The ACOG committee opinion states that CMA is recommended instead of a karyotype when the fetus has one or more major structural abnormalities identified on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. ACOG has also stated that CMA should be made available to any patient choosing to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558272566\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When chromosome analysis, including CMA, is normal, the next step in the genetic evaluation is testing for specific genetic conditions through molecular genetic studies. Clinicians should inform the laboratory that this additional testing might be requested if cytogenetic results are normal. This testing is performed on fetal DNA from cultured chorionic villi or amniocytes obtained at the time of the diagnostic procedure; if an adequate sample is obtained, DNA can often be directly extracted from chorionic villi or amniocytes without culture and shorten the time to results. If an adequate cultured or direct sample from the original procedure is not available, then a second procedure may be required. Patients must also be aware that parental blood samples are often required for confirmatory testing.</p><p>In the postnatal setting, molecular genetic studies often involve consultation with a medical geneticist and targeted testing based on recognized patterns of malformations and other clinical findings. Testing may include molecular genetic analysis, such as sequencing of single genes, gene panels, or WES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While the presence of a fetal anomaly increases the risk for an underlying genetic condition, the ability to test for specific conditions prenatally can be more challenging. There is often an incomplete presentation of characteristic phenotypes during the prenatal period. Additionally, genetic testing can be a long process, and the rapid turnaround required for prenatal testing often limits this process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2807804420\"><span class=\"h4\">Targeted gene sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted gene sequencing refers to testing of a specific gene or genes known to be associated with a genetic condition. Single gene testing in the prenatal period often relies on a positive family history and a previously identified mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For example, achondroplasia is caused by genetic alterations in the <em>FGFR3</em> gene. When achondroplasia is suspected clinically, sequencing the <em>FGFR3</em> gene can confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Some genetic conditions are associated with genetic changes in multiple genes. For example, Noonan syndrome has been associated with mutations in <em>PTPN11</em>, <em>SOS1</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>RAF1</em>, <em>NRAS</em>, <em>BRAF</em>, and <em>MAP2K1</em>. If Noonan syndrome is suspected clinically, then sequencing a panel of the genes associated with Noonan syndrome through next-generation sequencing (NGS) can confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The decision regarding which test to perform, and the interpretation of molecular genetic results can be complex, and usually should be done in consultation with a provider specializing in genetic testing, such as a certified genetic counselor or medical geneticist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3131806414\"><span class=\"h4\">Whole exome sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WES uses NGS to sequence the exome (regions of the genome that are known to encode proteins). The exome includes approximately 1 percent of the genome but is thought to contain 85 percent of disease-causing mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. WES platforms vary in their depth of sequencing (ie, the number of times a specific nucleotide is sequenced). The greater the depth, the higher the likelihood an identified sequence alteration is present and the lower the risk that actual sequence changes will be missed. WES does not sequence the remainder of the DNA (99 percent); for this reason, some sequence abnormalities, such as those occurring in promotor regions, would not be detected by WES.</p><p>A systematic review of 31 studies of prenatal WES in fetuses with anomalies reported diagnostic rates of 6.2 to 80 percent in studies with five or more cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to sequencing were the main reasons for the wide range of diagnostic rates. With a trio approach (fetus, mother, and father), it is possible to categorize variants identified in the fetus as a &quot;de novo&quot; event versus inherited from a parent. In the latter case, the variant is typically assumed not to have significant phenotypic contribution if present in a healthy parent. Diagnostic yields are greater in fetuses with multiple anomalies or in cases preselected following genetic review. While these results are promising for the use of this technology in the genetic evaluation of the anomalous fetus, many challenges remain for the routine clinical use of exome sequencing. Interpreting results from exome sequencing is a very lengthy process, and results may not be available quickly enough for patients who are making decisions about pregnancy termination. Additionally, much of the phenotypic data for specific sequence changes is incomplete, which makes interpretation of identified variants more difficult. Both of these challenges will likely lessen with time as the turnaround time decreases and our understanding of genetic variants improves. Many counseling and ethical issues related to prenatal WES also need to be addressed. Important issues include the need for appropriate consent, determining when to report secondary or incidental findings, the ongoing need for reanalysis of results, and the challenges of interpreting results in meaningful ways for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>The cost of WES can be substantial, and insurance coverage is limited. For these reasons, the decision to proceed with this type of testing should be done in consultation with a provider specializing in genetic testing, such as a certified genetic counselor or medical geneticist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>WES is used clinically for both pediatric and adult patients thought to have an underlying genetic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The following statements reflect the key points of a 2018 Joint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, and the Perinatal Quality Foundation on the use of genome-wide sequencing for fetal diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot currently be supported due to insufficient validation data and knowledge about its benefits and pitfalls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on a case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory genetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. Such cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert guidance of genetic professionals. Potential scenarios where fetal sequencing may be beneficial include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies that are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after microarray, or in select situations with no microarray result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there is a fetus with a multiple anomaly 'pattern' that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major single anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic diagnosis after karyotype or microarray.

However, some patients decline invasive procedures because they feel the results would not impact their decision to carry the pregnancy to term or they may find the risk of fetal loss to be unacceptable. If we suspect trisomy 21, 18, 13, or a sex chromosome aneuploidy, we offer a cell-free DNA screening test to these patients to provide additional information about the risk of aneuploidy in the pregnancy, with appropriate pretest and posttest counseling. Postnatal diagnostic testing is also an option for patients who decline prenatal screening and testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2628422742\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell-free DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of cell-free DNA screening using next-generation sequencing to detect chromosome aneuploidy in maternal blood has significantly impacted the prenatal screening paradigm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although primarily used for Down syndrome screening (trisomy 21), screening for trisomy 18, 13, and sex chromosome aneuploidy can be performed with high sensitivity and specificity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although screening tests, such as cell-free DNA, can be helpful in determining whether a fetus is at increased risk for aneuploidy, it must be stressed that these tests are not capable of making definitive diagnoses. It has been estimated that, in the setting of a fetal anomaly, 8 percent of chromosome abnormalities detectable by G-banded karyotype will be missed if cell-free DNA screening is performed instead of diagnostic testing. The magnitude of cell-free DNA underdiagnosis is expected to be even higher when compared with chromosomal microarray analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Patients should be counseled that a negative result on cell-free DNA screening does not eliminate the possibility of a genetic condition in the fetus and can be falsely reassuring in the setting of a fetal anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Therefore, further evaluation with a diagnostic test is recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering diagnostic testing rather than cell-free DNA screening if a fetal structural anomaly is identified on ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Patients also need to understand that an abnormal cell-free DNA test result may be a false positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The positive predictive value of a positive test is higher in the setting of a comprehensive ultrasound examination by an experienced sonologist that clearly shows features of trisomy 18, trisomy 13, or triploidy, but even in this setting prediction of fetal aneuploidy is not 100 percent accurate. In addition, a trisomy that results from an unbalanced rearrangement in the fetus could be inherited from a parent who carries a balanced rearrangement, which has implications for recurrence risk.<strong> Therefore, all abnormal cell-free DNA results should be confirmed with diagnostic testing, either pre or postnatally.</strong> Cell-free DNA results should also be confirmed prior to a pregnancy termination or any other irreversible procedure.

The use of expanded cell-free DNA screening (either microdeletion screening or &quot;whole genome&quot; coverage) in the setting of an anomalous fetus has not been clinically validated.

Patients who desire this level of information regarding the genetic status of their fetus should opt for diagnostic testing on amniocytes or chorionic villi. However, the authors have encountered patients who consider cell-free DNA screening to be an acceptable alternative to diagnostic testing. For these patients, the decision to proceed with cell-free DNA screening should only be made after appropriate counseling of the limitations of this testing.</p><p>It has been reported that 1 to 5 percent of cell-free DNA tests will report &quot;no result&quot; for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies.

Further evaluation following a test failure can include repeating cell-free DNA screening with a second sample or proceeding with diagnostic testing.

While the presence of multiple soft markers increases the risk for certain aneuploidies, the effect on the a priori risk is relatively small when only an isolated soft marker is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

If the patient elects this approach, we begin our evaluation with interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the common aneuploidies. Patients are given the option of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or traditional G-banded karyotype if FISH is normal. Other clinicians may omit FISH and go directly to CMA or conventional karyotype. Patients who elect to proceed with diagnostic testing should receive appropriate pretest counseling regarding the option of CMA versus G-banded karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast to pregnancies with fetal structural anomalies, data are limited on the value of CMA versus G-banded karyotyping when soft markers are identified on ultrasound. In a retrospective analysis that stratified CMA detection rates by specific ultrasound findings, CMA was positive in 2.6 percent of fetuses with isolated soft markers (2 of 77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Given the small number of cases in this study, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about the value of CMA when only soft markers are detected. However, from a large multicenter trial, we know that 1.7 percent of structurally normal fetuses with a normal G-banded karyotype have a clinically significant CMA finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>For patients with two or more soft markers who decline invasive diagnostic testing but are interested in further evaluation, the authors offer cell-free DNA screening because this is the most sensitive single test for the common aneuploidies. If results from cell-free DNA screening show no increased risk for trisomy 21, 18, 13, or sex chromosome anomalies, then patients are offered reassurance and typically continue with routine prenatal care.
