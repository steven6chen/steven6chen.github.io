These eight bones are collectively termed the carpus and are commonly divided into the proximal carpal row&mdash;scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform&mdash;and the distal row&mdash;trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and hamate. In general, carpal fractures occur from either direct or indirect trauma.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of basic carpal anatomy, mechanisms of injury, general principals of examination and imaging, and the initial care of adults with carpal fractures. More detailed discussions of common and important wrist injuries are presented separately.

Carpal fractures comprise upwards of 8 percent of hand fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Scaphoid fractures are by far the most common of the carpal fractures, and account for 10 percent of all hand fractures and 60 to 70 percent of all carpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The triquetrum is the second most common carpal fracture, comprising between 13 and 28 percent. Fractures of the trapezium, hamate, capitate and trapezoid follow in prevalence, ranging from 2 to 4 percent of carpal fractures. The pisiform is the rarest carpal fracture at 0.5 to 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/1,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal fractures are classified primarily by the anatomic location of the fracture (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> below) and secondarily based upon the features of the injury, including associated displacement, dislocation, and the number of fragments produced by the fracture (comminuted versus noncomminuted). </p><p>It is important to note that a significant proportion of carpal fractures involve multiple carpal bones, so if one carpal is fractured, the clinician should search for others.</p><p>Isolated fractures through the distal radius or ulna, although described in lay terms as &quot;wrist fractures,&quot; do not involve the carpal bones.

The most common mechanism involves a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist extended and radially deviated. Patients typically present with radial sided wrist pain, swelling, limited range of wrist motion, tenderness in the anatomic snuff box (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97472 \">figure 1</a>), and pain with axial loading along the thumb.

Patients typically present with wrist pain that is aggravated by wrist motion or gripping. Because of the intracapsular location of the lunate, swelling may be minimal. If presentation is late, stiffness or decreased range of motion of the wrist may be the only complaint. The diagnosis and management of lunate fractures are discussed separately.

Axial loading of the first metacarpal (thumb) is associated with vertical intra-articular fractures of the trapezium, while axial loading of the index metacarpal is associated with fracture of the trapezoid, with which it articulates.

Less commonly, hyperextension of the wrist may cause an avulsion fracture of the pisiform, typically at the distal attachment of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon.

Tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82859 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97472 \">figure 1</a>) suggests a scaphoid injury but may also indicate a trapezium injury. Palpation of the Lister tubercle on the dorsal radius (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86693\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86693 \">picture 6</a>) is helpful for locating the scapholunate articulation, which is located just distal to the tubercle. Palmar-predominant pain is more likely to involve the pisiform (at the base of the hypothenar eminence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107905 \">picture 2</a>)) or hamate hook (within the hypothenar eminence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86753\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86753 \">picture 4</a>)), or the distal, volar pole of the scaphoid at the base of the thenar eminence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100554 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p>After carpal fracture, the ensuing pain often causes a reduction in wrist motion and in the strength of wrist flexion and extension, and hand grip. Neurovascular function should be assessed, as fractures and dislocations can damage adjacent nerves or blood vessels. Any possible fracture with neurovascular compromise warrants emergency treatment and consultation with hand surgery.

These issues are discussed in the individual topics devoted to specific carpal injuries. The basic indications for immediate referral remain unchanged and include any persistent vascular or neurologic deficit, open fracture, displaced fracture, fracture associated with dislocation or bony instability, and the development of any significant complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principals of fracture management apply to carpal fractures. The following are recommended:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize further tissue injury, particularly of neural and vascular structures, by immobilizing the fracture. Because substantial soft tissue swelling may occur as a result of the fracture, initial immobilization is generally achieved by applying a removable plaster or fiberglass or moldable thermoplastic splint. The splint can later be removed to allow reduction, fixation, and casting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply ice to the injured area to minimize swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients obtain adequate pain relief from immobilization, ice, and over-the-counter analgesics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. Opioid analgesics are occasionally needed to control pain during the first three to five days. Patients requesting opioids beyond this time should be reevaluated for irritation from a poorly fitting splint or cast, a missed injury, or a fracture complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;, section on 'Pain management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on fracture healing remain a source of debate, but these drugs are best avoided with known or suspected acute fractures to minimize the risk of nonunion. These issues are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Healing of musculoskeletal injury'</a>.)</p><p>Rehabilitation of the wrist after immobilization for a carpal fracture is extremely important. Without quality rehabilitation, return to full function can be slow and possibly incomplete, resulting in chronic disability. Whenever possible, we recommend referral to an occupational or physical therapist with experience managing wrist injuries.</p><p>Treatment and rehabilitation of a carpal fracture generally consists of the following phases: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory and reparative phases</strong> &ndash; These occur while the fracture is immobilized, as outlined above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transition-to-maturation phase</strong> &ndash; After immobilization the wrist is stiff and sore. Treatments such as heat (soaking in hot water or paraffin wax for a few minutes) can be helpful prior to gentle passive range-of-motion exercises. These exercises are done in three planes of wrist motion: flexion-extension, ulnar-radial deviation, and pronation-supination. If needed, attention should be paid to restoring finger mobility. Several weeks may be needed to regain full wrist mobility, but marked gains are often made after one to two weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maturation phase</strong> &ndash; Once fracture healing is complete and mobility has been regained, the patient spends approximately two to eight weeks working to restore strength to the muscles about the wrist and hand. These include wrist flexors and extensors, ulnar and radial deviators, pronators and supinators, and finger flexors and extensors. This can be accomplished using elastic resistance bands, manual resistance provided by the uninjured hand, or specially designed devices found in physical therapy clinics. Therapists can also transition the patient into activities that replicate occupational or sport-specific tasks that need to be re-mastered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional discussion of carpal fractures may be found in texts that address the issue from an orthopedic surgical standpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>], the primary care perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and with relation specifically to fractures in athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-carpal-fractures/abstract/3,10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
