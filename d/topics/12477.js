Nerve conduction study (NCS) techniques permit stimulation and recording of electrical activity from individual peripheral nerves with sufficient accuracy, reproducibility, and standardization to determine normal values, characterize abnormal findings, and correlate neurophysiologic-pathologic features.</p><p>These clinical studies are used to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnose focal and generalized disorders of peripheral nerves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aid in the differentiation of primary nerve and muscle disorders (although NCS itself evaluates nerve and not muscle)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classify peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities due to axonal degeneration, demyelination, and conduction block</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosticate regarding clinical course and efficacy of treatment</p><p/><p>The basic anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the peripheral nervous system, as reflected in the clinical study of nerve conduction, will be reviewed here. Needle electromyography is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND NORMAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most peripheral nerves are composed of nerve fibers with motor, sensory, and autonomic functions; these are &quot;mixed&quot; nerves. However, certain nerves available for clinical neurophysiologic investigation contain primarily motor fibers (eg, anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve) or primarily sensory fibers (eg, sural, superficial peroneal, superficial radial).</p><p>The most widely used classification of individual nerve fibers relates to their diameters, myelin properties, and conductivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A-alpha (or A-alpha beta) are large myelinated fibers, 6 to 15 microns in diameter. The largest muscle afferent fibers are sometimes classified as 1a fibers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A-delta are small myelinated fibers, 3 to 5 microns in diameter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C fibers are unmyelinated fibers, 0.5 to 2 microns in diameter</p><p/><p>Functionally, most efferent motor fibers are large myelinated (A-alpha). Sensory fibers mediating touch, vibration, and position senses are also large myelinated (A-alpha), while those that mediate cold and pain sensations are small myelinated (A-delta), and those that mediate warm and pain sensations are unmyelinated C fibers. Efferent postganglionic sympathetic autonomic fibers are unmyelinated C fibers.</p><p>Clinical neurophysiologic techniques are able to study only the largest A-alpha fibers; this poses a problem in clinical situations where strength and vibration and position senses are unaffected, but pain and temperature sensations are abnormal, a condition frequently referred to as &quot;small fiber neuropathy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Compound action potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) are compound potentials that represent the summated electrical activity of individual nerve fibers simultaneously activated by nerve stimulation. For both SNAPs and CMAPs (recorded from muscle), this electrical activity is generated by A-alpha fibers. With special techniques, such as digital averaging of many stimulus responses with near-nerve recording electrodes, electrical activity of sensory A-delta fibers can be visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Conductivity in myelinated fibers is saltatory, ie, node-to-node (Ranvier) depolarization, and the speed of conduction is fiber-diameter dependent. The largest fibers conduct the fastest; the relationship between fiber diameter and conduction velocity of electrical impulses is roughly linear with a conversion factor of about 4.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> in healthy people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Thus, 14 to 15 micron fibers conduct in the range of 65 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s,</span> whereas 6 to 7 micron fibers conduct at approximately 30 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span>.</p><p>For the SNAP, the peak-to-peak amplitude and the area under the waveform of the compound potential reflects the number of nerve fibers activated, while the CMAP amplitude more accurately reflects the number of activated muscle fibers than nerve fibers.</p><p>In acute nerve lesions, when nerve regeneration has not had time to develop, the loss of motor nerve fibers parallels the loss of muscle fibers capable of being activated, and CMAP amplitude is reduced accordingly. In chronic nerve lesions, however, CMAP amplitude is a poor estimate of motor nerve fiber number because surviving motor units reinnervate previously denervated muscle fibers via collateral sprouting of terminal motor nerve fiber branches. Subsequent to this process of reinnervation, there are reduced numbers of motor fibers, each with enlarged motor unit territories and increased numbers of muscle fibers per motor unit, and stimulation can result in a CMAP whose amplitude is normal or only mildly reduced. In this context, contributions from electromyography and motor unit number estimation techniques may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal dispersion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in conduction speed of A-alpha myelinated fibers contributing to compound evoked potentials create a temporal dispersion of electrical activities such that the largest and fastest conducting fibers contribute to the earliest part of the potential and slower conducting fibers contribute to later parts. Thus, the onset latency of a compound evoked potential is determined by the conduction speed of the fastest fibers. In addition, the potential has a measurable duration from the time it first leaves the baseline to when it returns.</p><p>The concept of temporal dispersion can be understood by envisioning an automobile race over a distance of 120 miles; the fastest cars travel 60 miles per hour, the slowest 40 miles per hour. Shortly after the start, the cars are bunched together, and their concentration (representing CMAP amplitude) is greatest, while the spread between the fastest and slowest cars (representing duration) is shortest. However, as the race proceeds cars splay out and their concentration at any one point decreases. When the fastest cars reach the finish line at two hours, the slowest cars are 40 miles behind. There, the concentration (amplitude) of cars is less than anywhere previously and the distance (duration) between the fastest and slowest cars is greatest.</p><p>With increasing lengths of nerve segment between stimulating and recording electrodes, temporal dispersion increases and amplitude decreases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78960 \">figure 1</a>). As an example, one study of upper extremity nerves recorded from hand muscles found that proximal stimulation at Erb's point in the supraclavicular fossa resulted in a 20 percent decline in CMAP amplitude and a 10 percent increase in CMAP negative phase duration compared with distal stimulation at the wrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Abnormal temporal dispersion is characterized by an excessive difference in slowing between individual motor axons within a nerve; it typically results from altered or damaged myelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The consensus criteria from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), created for research purposes, define abnormal temporal dispersion as &gt;20 percent drop in CMAP amplitude and &gt;15 percent change in CMAP duration between proximal and distal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) criteria define it as &gt;30 percent increase in proximal versus distal CMAP duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The relationship between increasing temporal dispersion and increasing length of nerve segment is approximately linear for motor conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but not so for sensory conduction. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Sensory nerve conduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase cancellation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the recorded potentials of both single motor units and single sensory fibers have both positive and negative components, phase cancellation can occur depending on the conduction velocity of individual fibers. Phase cancellation becomes more significant with greater distances between stimulating and recording electrodes.</p><p>Individual sensory and motor nerve fibers contribute differently to compound SNAPs and CMAPs, respectively. A single large myelinated sensory fiber action potential has a much shorter duration (typically 2 msec) than a single motor unit potential (typically 5 to 15 msec). Because of this short duration, a small amount of dispersion will produce a much more dramatic reduction in SNAP amplitude than CMAP amplitude. Increasing conduction distance decreases median and ulnar SNAP amplitudes 16 to 17 times more than corresponding decreases in CMAP amplitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, there are no accepted criteria for the extent to which SNAP amplitude may decline with increasing distance between stimulating and recording electrodes. This issue becomes important when considering diagnostic criteria for demyelinating diseases of nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Saltatory conduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saltatory conduction is the term used to describe the rapid propagation of action potentials along myelinated fibers in which nodes of Ranvier are interspersed between myelinated internodal areas along the axon. Conduction jumps from node to node along the nerve fiber by activation of inward sodium currents, which generate an outward capacitive (driving) current at the next node. The nodal membrane is depolarized to threshold, opening sodium channels and initiating another cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When the driving current exceeds the threshold current of the nerve, conduction occurs. The ratio of driving current to threshold current is the safety factor, and is normally &gt;5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Because of saltatory conduction, the conduction velocity of myelinated fibers is &gt;10 times faster than what would be predicted for an unmyelinated axon of the same diameter.</p><p>Original theories regarding saltatory conduction posited that the myelin sheath acted as an insulator, preventing current leakage along the internodal axon. However, later evidence suggested that myelin may actually leak current, and that its major role is to limit nodal capacitance to a minimum, thereby allowing the node to depolarize rapidly to threshold. In this model, the most important section of the myelin sheath responsible for maintaining saltatory conduction is the paranodal area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One report found that reduced nodal and paranodal ionic conductances in motor and sensory axons in vivo predated clinical symptoms, signs, and electrophysiologic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic factors affecting nerve conduction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific nerves and nerve segments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normative data for distal latencies, conduction velocities, and evoked potential measurements vary in regard to specific nerves and nerve segments. For instance, nerve conduction velocities are 15 to 20 percent faster in upper extremity nerves than in lower extremity nerves, and 5 to 10 percent faster in proximal segments compared with distal segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Sensory conduction is 5 to 10 percent faster than motor conduction for each mixed nerve segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve conduction velocities are about half normal adult values in full-term infants and increase into the adult range by age three to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They then plateau until ages 25 to 30 and decline slowly thereafter at approximately 1 to 3 percent per decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Decreases in median and ulnar sensory conduction velocities have been estimated at 0.13 to 0.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Effectively, this is a change of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> or less even into the ninth decade.</p><p>There is a negative correlation between age and evoked potential amplitude, probably related to loss of nerve fibers with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The decline can be as much as 50 to 75 percent for the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in the median, ulnar, sural, and superficial peroneal nerves between the second and ninth decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the decline varies from nerve to nerve, and is more pronounced for the SNAP than the compound muscle action potential (CMAP).</p><p>The issue of absent evoked potentials in normal elderly subjects, when recording with surface electrodes, is unsettled. One study found that responses could not be recorded in &lt;1 percent of patients age 50 and younger, whereas loss of responses was common in those aged 70 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The sural nerve SNAP was most vulnerable, being absent in 24 percent of patients in their eighth decade and 40 percent in their ninth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in other studies, sural SNAPs were found in all subjects up to age 76 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and to age 88 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, sural SNAPs were found in all normal subjects as old as age 90 with near-nerve electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Height, weight, gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a negative correlation between height and nerve conduction velocity, more so for lower extremity nerves, and the effect of height is greater than that of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Conversely, age has a much greater effect than height on evoked potential amplitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Women have faster conduction velocities than men, possibly due to height differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The higher sural SNAP amplitudes seen in women may relate to differences in subcutaneous tissue at the ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>SNAP amplitudes declined with increasing body mass index in two studies but not in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/18,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,22</a>]. Body mass index affects specific nerve segments; ulnar conduction velocities across the elbow directly correlated with body mass index, but not ulnar forearm conduction velocities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Possible explanations are that nerve length may be overestimated in the presence of adipose tissue, or that added insulation may produce higher local nerve temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A study of healthy Malaysian subjects of different ethnicities confirmed the aforementioned effects of aging, but found that correlations between nerve conduction studies and height, weight, and gender varied among the nerves tested, and that ethnicity affected normative values (eg, Indian subjects had slower conduction velocities and higher CMAP and SNAP amplitudes than Malay or Chinese subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temperature of nerve segments undergoing testing has a significant effect on nerve conductivity and evoked potential amplitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In normal subjects, within a range that excludes very high or very low temperatures, decreased local temperature results in the following changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased evoked potential amplitudes, by 1.76 to 2.27 percent per degree Celsius (C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased distal latencies, by 2.52 percent per degree C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased conduction velocities, by 1.2 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> per degree C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]</p><p/><p>Because of the large magnitude of these changes and their potential role in confounding result interpretation, standardization of temperature during testing is necessary. The arm should be maintained at 34 to 36 degrees C and the leg at 32 to 34 degrees C. The situation is of particular importance during cold weather and in patients with anxiety-induced sympathetic overactivity. External infrared heating elements, hot packs, and hot water baths can be effective in raising limb temperatures, but measured skin temperature may differ considerably from intramuscular or nerve temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Correction factors to compensate for low limb temperatures during testing are not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential parameters evaluated during clinical peripheral nerve conduction studies are the amplitudes, areas, configurations, and durations of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAPs) and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) evoked by peripheral nerve stimulation, and the sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities. All measures are dependent upon the integrity of the largest myelinated fibers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral nerve activation involves placement of a stimulating cathode (negative pole) and anode (positive pole) over the nerve and generating an electrical pulse between them. Negative charges accumulate under the cathode and depolarize the nerve. Simultaneously, the nerve is hyperpolarized under the anode. Modern stimulators generate a square or rectangular wave pulse, the duration and strength of which can be varied. The most commonly used durations are 0.1 to 0.2 msec, but pulses with durations of up to 1 msec may be necessary with diseased nerves and when studying the H reflex.</p><p>With increasing stimulus strength a threshold level is reached, which is the minimum stimulus needed to depolarize some individual fibers in the underlying nerve and thereby generate a propagating action potential. Greater stimulus strength recruits more nerve fibers and progressively increases the compound action potential until a maximum size is reached. For motor conduction studies, a maximal stimulus strength can be reached such that all motor axons within the nerve that can be activated are activated. However, compared with motor axons, sensory fibers have a greater variability in fiber diameter and sensitivity to stimulation. Thus, a maximum response may be reached that represents activation of all large myelinated sensory fibers but that does not include smaller myelinated fibers.</p><p>A supramaximal stimulus, 10 to 20 percent above the maximal stimulus level, is employed to ensure that variations in stimulus intensity or inadvertent minor changes in the relationship between stimulator and nerve do not affect the action potential, particularly its amplitude and onset latency. In normal nerves, stimuli of 100 to 300 V, or 10 to 30 mA, delivered through surface electrodes, are usually sufficient to provide supramaximal stimulation. Higher intensity stimuli may be required at more proximal stimulation sites, especially in patients with a higher body mass index. In achieving supramaximal stimulation, stimulus intensity and duration are inversely related; the greater the stimulus intensity, the less the duration needed, and vice versa. That said, a stimulus duration of 0.2 msec may be preferred because it is most acceptable from a pain perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Surface electrodes are convenient to use and do not puncture the skin, but require considerable stimulus strength (and hence discomfort) as they are at a distance from the underlying nerve. Needle electrodes placed close to the nerve (ie, near-nerve electrodes) puncture the skin and have to be positioned properly but use less current and produce less pain during supramaximal stimulation. Additionally, there is less stimulus artifact and less stimulus spread along the nerve, so the specific site of nerve excitation and the calculated conduction velocity can be determined more precisely. Near-nerve electrodes are also able to record smaller SNAPs in diseases of nerves, especially with digital averaging to increase signal-to-noise ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/2,3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surface recording electrodes are typically used to record the electrical activity resulting from nerve excitation. These electrodes are placed over a muscle, a sensory nerve, or a cutaneous nerve distribution. The parameters most often studied are the time (latency) between the stimulus artifact and the onset of the compound action potential, and the amplitude, duration, area, and configuration of the compound action potential.</p><p>In motor nerve studies, recording occurs from muscles. The active electrode is placed over the motor point (endplate) and the reference electrode over the muscle tendon; they record summated activity from all activated muscle fibers under the active electrode. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is recorded by the active electrode as a near-field potential. Although the reference electrode is considered electrically silent, it does record far-field or volume-conducted electrical activity from other concurrently activated muscles (eg, with ulnar nerve stimulation and activation of multiple hand muscles), or from faster conducting sensory fibers, thereby contributing to the CMAP and potentially interfering with the interpretation of CMAP amplitude and onset latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As an example, the reference electrode can record electrical activity from multiple small foot muscles during lower extremity motor nerve conduction studies; the greater distances between the recording electrodes at the foot and the stimulating electrodes at the popliteal fossa (tibial nerve) or fibular head (fibular nerve) magnify the effects of temporal dispersion and phase cancellation, which can reduce the proximal CMAP amplitude enough to give the false impression of a partial conduction block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Conduction block'</a> below.)</p><p>For recording of sensory potentials, digital averaging of evoked responses to multiple stimuli is often employed. This technique increases the signal-to-noise ratio by the square root of the number of stimuli averaged. Small SNAPs having identical latencies after each stimulus can be differentiated from baseline, as baseline noise is reduced.

Peripheral nerve disorders, both focal and generalized, can affect either of these structures alone or together.</p><p>Electrophysiologic studies attempt to characterize abnormalities according to which mechanism predominates in a particular disorder and patient. However, this division is simplistic and not absolute; complex <span class=\"nowrap\">axon/myelin</span> interactions exist, many diseases have both axonal loss and demyelination (eg, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 1, severe carpal tunnel syndrome), and axonal changes can occur secondary to disorders of myelin. In some patients, the results do not allow distinction. Further, in conditions with axonal loss, nerve conduction study findings come from conduction in fibers that are still functional, and there is no contribution from the most affected degenerated fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In demyelinating disorders, the nerve conduction study findings reflect conduction in affected nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The determination of underlying nerve pathology utilizing electrophysiologic studies is heavily dependent upon methodology. Motor conduction studies are better for this purpose than sensory conduction studies, but concurrent histopathologic correlation and confirmation is not possible as motor nerves are not biopsied. However, a few studies of patients with suspected peripheral neuropathy compared sural nerve surface sensory conduction results obtained from surface electrodes versus those obtained from on-nerve needles placed on exposed sural nerves during biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. When the electrophysiologic data were correlated with histopathologic findings, the diagnostic sensitivity for demyelination or axonal degeneration with surface sensory electrode studies was low (26 percent), whereas the diagnostic sensitivity with the on-nerve technique was much higher (69 percent), and comparable to the near-nerve technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Axonal degeneration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary feature of axonal degeneration seen with nerve conduction studies is reduced amplitude. The conduction velocity may also be reduced to the extent that the largest axons are affected; in this setting, the measured conduction velocity reflects the velocity of the largest remaining axons. Nevertheless, the degree of conduction slowing with axonal degeneration is less than with demyelination.</p><p>Pathologic conditions affecting peripheral nerves may produce focal or general loss of axons. The axons relevant to clinical neurophysiologic studies are A-alpha fibers with diameters of 6 to 15 microns. Loss of these fibers is manifested as a decrease in amplitude and a change in configuration (increased dispersion and increased number of phases) of the compound evoked potentials. In addition, loss of these fibers causes slowing in maximum conduction velocity.</p><p>Since the largest fibers contribute to the earliest part of the compound evoked potential, their loss results in an increase in conduction time and a decrease in conduction velocity. As an example, if all fibers &gt;10 microns in diameter are lost, then the fastest conduction velocities of the remaining fibers would be in the 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> range. Normally, maximum conduction velocities are in the 65 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> range.</p><p>Small A-delta fibers make little if any contribution to the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and C fibers make none. Thus, these SNAPs and CMAPs are normal in neuropathies that exclusively or predominantly affect small fibers.</p><p>By the &quot;80 percent rule&quot;, the conduction velocity should be &gt;80 percent of the lower limits of normal when the amplitude of the evoked potential is &gt;80 percent of the normal value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A greater loss of fast conducting fibers could be responsible for greater conduction slowing. However, in pure axonal loss lesions, the conduction slowing cannot go below 70 percent of the lower limits of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or 60 percent of the normal mean for that particular nerve and segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This is amplitude-dependent slowing, ie, conduction velocity is reduced because a subpopulation of faster conducting axons have been lost, not because of demyelination of conducting axons.</p><p>Practically, assuming the variables of height, age, and temperature are taken into account, conduction velocities &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> are compatible with axonal loss, whereas velocities &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> most likely reflect demyelination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders of myelin-demyelination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When myelin is disrupted (demyelination), especially in paranodal areas, nodal capacitance increases, and resistance decreases.

That is why the consensus criteria discussed above are, in part, dependent upon CMAP amplitude and the amplitude, in part, determines the criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These criteria are usually considered sufficiently specific, but insufficiently sensitive to be used in clinical practice. This raises the risk of not diagnosing and hence, not treating patients who actually have inflammatory or autoimmune demyelinating disorders that may be responsive to immunosuppressive treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis.</p><p>Multiple studies have attempted to refine the consensus criteria in the hopes of increasing their sensitivity and specificity. Many such studies have used the electrophysiologic findings in motor neuron disorders and axonal polyneuropathies as representative of axonal degeneration, and have defined criteria for primary demyelination in contrast. As an example, the following are one set of proposed criteria for primary demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor conduction velocities &lt;70 percent of the lower limit of normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged motor distal latency of &gt;150 percent of the upper limit of normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged F wave latency of &gt;120 percent of the upper limit of normal with distal CMAP negative peak amplitude of &gt;80 percent of the lower limit of normal, with findings present in at least two nerves.

One group of investigators determined that distal CMAP durations (from onset of the first negative deflection to return to baseline of the last negative deflection) are abnormal and indicative of demyelination when &gt;8.5 msec in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and &gt;9 msec in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, this phenomenon cannot be used to distinguish between acquired and hereditary demyelinating polyneuropathies, since one study found that distal CMAP prolongations of &gt;9 msec occur in a clinically significant proportion of patients with hereditary demyelinating neuropathies (eg, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

(Distal conduction block may be considered when muscle weakness exists without muscle atrophy or denervation activity on electromyography). If a reduced distal CMAP amplitude is due to axonal loss, then greater desynchronization and phase cancellation can produce further reductions in CMAP amplitude with proximal stimulation and obscure possible conduction block.</p><p>Conduction block is significantly influenced by membrane hyperpolarization when an axon conducts a rapid train of impulses either via external stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] or voluntary activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This activity-dependent, or frequency-dependent, hyperpolarization blocks conduction when the safety factor is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Axonal membrane hyperpolarization was found distal to the site of conduction block in multifocal motor neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In multifocal motor neuropathy, the electrophysiologic features of the block may change depending on disease duration; depolarizing blocks were seen in patients with shorter disease duration (two years) and hyperpolarizing blocks in patients with more chronic disease (five or more years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Frequency-dependent conduction block has also been found in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and significantly prolonged motor latencies. It may explain grip weakness associated with this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Conduction block can also be caused by mechanisms other than demyelination, such as sodium channel blockade or ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In multifocal motor neuropathy, antibody interference with sodium movement across the nodal membrane may play a role in conduction block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Sensory fibers are much less susceptible to conduction block than motor fibers for various physiologic reasons, including protection against hyperpolarization due to greater inward rectification, a more active sodium-potassium pump, greater expression of persistent sodium channels, and a higher safety factor for impulse transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/11,46,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,46,58</a>]. Additionally, partial sensory conduction block may be more difficult to define because of the effects of normal temporal dispersion and phase cancellation on the SNAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Nonetheless, partial sensory conduction block has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and can occur in multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM, Lewis-Sumner syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve conduction studies are invaluable in defining and determining peripheral nervous system function, dysfunction, and disease, both focally, as in entrapment neuropathies, and generally, as in polyneuropathies. Some conditions (eg, conduction block) can only be diagnosed with conduction studies. Conduction studies can also provide the electropathophysiologic diagnoses in other conditions, such as axonal damage versus demyelination.</p><p>Nerve conduction studies may also be helpful in determining therapies, such as when to do surgery in the carpal tunnel syndrome, or when to use immunosuppressive therapy in polyneuropathies. Because they are reliable and reproducible, nerve conduction studies can provide objective evidence of efficacy with therapy and in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>While nerve conduction studies can distinguish various types of electropathophysiologic abnormalities of large myelinated fibers, they most often cannot determine specific etiologies. Since conduction studies evaluate large myelinated fiber functions, they are often normal in polyneuropathies with predominant small fiber involvement, and in neuropathic pain conditions. Nevertheless, one study found electrodiagnostic evidence that small fiber sensory neuropathy progresses to large fiber involvement 5 to 10 years after onset of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Nerve conduction studies are also of limited value for quantifying the clinical severity of muscle weakness and large fiber sensory loss; thus, some authors view them as surrogate measures of polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Concurrent electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve conduction studies should not be performed or interpreted in isolation.

This is critically important in patients with suspected radiculopathy, plexopathy, myopathy, motor neuropathy, or motor neuron disease. In addition, the complementary information derived from electromyography is useful to ensure that an underlying disease process is not missed (eg, radiculopathy in a patient with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome).

The major risks involve possible electrical injury from stray leakage currents. Intensive care unit settings predispose to increased risk when patients are attached to multiple electrical devices plugged into different power outlets.

Normal differences among individual nerve fibers in action potential conduction speed and duration can affect the amplitude and duration of compound potentials via temporal dispersion and phase cancellation. Normal nerve conduction parameters also vary with regard to specific nerves, nerve segments, individual patient characteristics, and temperature. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and normal neurophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface recording electrodes are typically used to record the electrical activity resulting from nerve excitation. These electrodes are placed over a muscle, a sensory nerve, or a cutaneous nerve distribution. The essential parameters evaluated are the amplitudes, areas, durations, and configurations of the SNAPs and CMAPs, and the conduction velocities of sensory and motor nerves. They are dependent upon the integrity of the largest myelinated fibers. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Methodology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F waves are late responses generated by supramaximal nerve stimulation. Electrical activity moving proximally in motor nerves activates or backfires motor neurons, which can generate an orthodromic response known as the F wave that is visible as a low amplitude late potential. F waves are useful for evaluating peripheral neuropathies with predominantly proximal involvement. The F wave is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;, section on 'F waves'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The H reflex is a true reflex with an afferent arc mediated by large, fast-conducting group 1a fibers, and an efferent arc mediated by alpha motor neurons. It is visible only with submaximal stimulation and is most consistently seen with tibial nerve stimulation in the popliteal fossa when recording from the soleus and plantar foot muscles. The H reflex is useful for evaluating the S1 nerve root in suspected radiculopathies and proximal conduction in polyneuropathies. The H reflex is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;, section on 'H reflex'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three main pathologic mechanisms that affect peripheral nerve are axonal degeneration, demyelination, and conduction block (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The primary feature of axonal degeneration is reduced amplitude of SNAPs or CMAPs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The primary feature of demyelination is reduced conduction velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conduction block can occur with acquired demyelinating nerve lesions.
