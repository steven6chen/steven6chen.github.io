The diagnosis of hollow viscus injury may be delayed, since the more obvious solid visceral injuries that frequently accompany them are managed nonoperatively, and imaging studies (specifically computed tomographic [CT] scan), when performed soon after the injury, may fail to demonstrate them. Definitive management of children with blunt abdominal trauma who are evaluated for hollow viscus injury depends on clinical findings. Most require surgical intervention. </p><p>This topic will review blunt hollow visceral injuries in children, including mesenteric injury, duodenal hematoma, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Evaluation and management of traumatic liver, pancreas, and splenic injuries in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver, spleen, and pancreas injury in children with blunt abdominal trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, bowel injuries associated with rectal foreign bodies are reviewed elsewhere.

The overall frequency of blunt hollow visceral injuries among children in the United States ranges from &lt;1 to 5 percent in large reviews of pediatric blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Injury to the small bowel (specifically jejunal perforation) is seen most commonly, followed by injury to the duodenum, colon, and stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The majority of gastrointestinal (GI) injuries are caused through a discrete point of energy transfer (eg, direct blow, seat belt injury, bicycle handlebar injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Motor vehicle accidents are the most prevalent cause in reviews from pediatric trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,4,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7-12</a>]. Falls and bicycle handlebar injuries are other frequent causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/3,4,7-9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7-9,11</a>].</p><p>The typical mechanism for these injuries is rapid acceleration or deceleration of the intestinal structure near a point of anatomic fixation (eg, the ligament of Treitz), or the trapping of bowel between the seat belt and the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It has been shown that children improperly restrained by ill-fitting seat belts are four times more likely to suffer hollow viscus trauma than properly restrained children, and that those with the &ldquo;seat belt sign&rdquo;(an area of ecchymosis or abrasion across the abdomen) are 13 times as likely to have gastrointestinal (GI) trauma than those without it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7836235\"><span class=\"h2\">Child abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious abdominal injury after inflicted blunt trauma may be indicated by abdominal tenderness, abdominal distension, enlargement of the liver or spleen, or abdominal wall bruising without a history of trauma or with an implausible mechanism (eg, fall down the stairs). However, nonspecific historical features such as vomiting or fussiness may be the only symptoms and few overt signs may be present on physical examination, including lack of cutaneous bruising. Thus, evaluation for occult abdominal injury is an important part of any child abuse evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7836200\"><span class=\"h2\">Seat belt syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seventy percent of patients with hollow visceral trauma will have associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/1,3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,16,17</a>]. This associated injury most frequently involves the pancreas and seldom involves the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The &ldquo;seat belt syndrome&rdquo; is a well described injury pattern that typically includes the combination of a transverse bruise on the abdomen, anterior compression fracture or subluxation of the lumbar spine from hyperflexion, visceral trauma, and, rarely, abdominal aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The rate of intraabdominal injury in patients with transverse lap belt-induced bruises ranges from 15 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>] </p><p>The poor fit of a lap seat belt in younger children and the anatomic inability of the small pediatric pelvis to properly anchor the lap portion of the belt appear to be risk factors for seat belt syndrome. The belt rides up over the pelvis, into the abdomen, compressing the intraabdominal contents against the spine during rapid deceleration. This injury pattern occurs most commonly in children between three to nine years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>As with other mechanisms of bowel perforation, the diagnosis of GI tract injury in children with seat belt syndrome is frequently not immediately apparent on physical examination. Consequently, observation and serial exams are recommended for children with a seat belt sign following a motor vehicle crash. In one prospective observational study, 6 of 46 patients with a seat belt sign (ie, a transverse bruise) had no complaint of abdominal pain or tenderness to palpation on initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. None were subsequently diagnosed with an intraabdominal injury, suggesting that children without abdominal pain and tenderness may be at low risk for a significant GI tract injury, despite the presence of a seat belt sign. </p><p>Associated extraabdominal injuries (especially head injuries) are the major source of mortality in patients with GI trauma. Mortality from isolated hollow viscus injury varies from 0 percent in some series to near 20 percent in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23</a>]. Death due to peritonitis and sepsis is markedly increased if surgical repair takes place beyond 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391773\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC ASPECTS OF SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391780\"><span class=\"h2\">Duodenum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duodenum's location in the retroperitoneum affords it protection, thus significant force must be applied to cause injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/6,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24,25</a>]. Duodenal injury occurs in 2 to 10 percent of children after blunt abdominal trauma and is a marker for child abuse in children younger than two years of age who do <strong>not</strong> have a history of serious abdominal trauma along with jejunal injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Blunt mechanism of injury may cause hematoma or perforation. Duodenal hematomas occur when the duodenum is compressed against the vertebral column. This disrupts blood vessels between the submucosa and the muscularis. The resulting hematoma may cause partial or complete obstruction of the duodenal lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Vomiting, the most common symptom, often begins 24 to 48 hours after the time of the injury. Duodenal hematomas are more common in children than adults, and the overwhelming majority will resolve with nonoperative management: nasogastric decompression, bowel rest, and parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/9,16,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16,17,24</a>].</p><p>Duodenal perforation results from shearing forces and occurs where the fixed portions of the duodenum meet its intraperitoneal segments. Rapid compressive forces can give rise to a sudden, dramatic increase in intraluminal pressure that causes a &ldquo;blowout&rdquo; injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26</a>]. Perforation is less common than hematoma, and can be difficult to diagnose, especially when it is retroperitoneal, as peritonitis may not be evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The interval between injury and intervention correlates with morbidity and mortality, so early diagnosis is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/9,17,24,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,24,25,27</a>]. Duodenal perforations are always managed operatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391787\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric injury occurs in only 0.9 to 1.8 percent of children who experience blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. Shielding by the ribcage as well as the distensibility and mobility of the stomach are protective and make injuries to the stomach uncommon. Immediately following a meal, the stomach is distended and extends below the ribcage making it more vulnerable to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Perforation is the most commonly reported gastric injury. In two large retrospective reviews describing gastrointestinal injuries in children, 100 percent of gastric perforations presented with generalized peritonitis and free air on abdominal radiograph, making rapid diagnosis straightforward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>]. Gastric perforation mandates surgical repair. The stomach's rich blood supply facilitates healing and direct repair is virtually always successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391794\"><span class=\"h2\">Small intestine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jejunal perforation is the most common hollow viscus injury, occurring in over a third of patients in most retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,4,7,10,16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7,10,16,28</a>]. When there is no history of significant abdominal trauma, it is an injury that is suggestive of child abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.) </p><p>Injuries to the jejunum and ileum are caused by high energy bursting forces or direct blows near fixed points like the ligament of Treitz or the ileocecal valve, and by sudden deceleration resulting in a shearing force at the mesenteric attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>]. Mesenteric injuries that compromise the blood supply to the small intestine can lead to delayed perforation from ischemic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Particularly with the later mechanism, a complaint of pain, tenderness to palpation, or both may only appear after 12 to 24 hours. </p><p>Peritoneal signs may be less obvious in patients with small bowel injury. Jejunal contents are less irritating than those of the stomach or colon. Small intestinal secretions are much less acidic than gastric juice and have a relatively low bacterial count compared to feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Despite this lower bacterial count, complications related to small bowel perforation are primarily infectious (ie, sepsis, intra-abdominal abscess, and wound infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10391801\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colon injuries occur in 2 to 5 percent of pediatric victims of blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The transverse colon is susceptible to crush injuries from compression against the spine. The sigmoid colon is tethered at its junction with the rectum, putting it at risk for perforation from rapid deceleration injuries. All segments of the colon are vulnerable to blowout disruption and, excepting the rectum, avulsion from the mesentery. These injuries are evenly distributed throughout the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>].</p><p>Colon injuries, like most blunt bowel injuries, are difficult to diagnose. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Multi-institutional Hollow Viscus Injury Study, a two year review of 96 trauma centers representing 798 patients with blunt <span class=\"nowrap\">colonic/rectal</span> injury, found no diagnostic test or combination of physical findings that reliably exclude blunt colonic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Colonic perforations are always treated operatively. Even with relatively prompt surgery, patients with colon injury are at significantly higher risk of complications than patients with small bowel injury. The same multi-institutional study found a complication rate of 36 percent in patients with colon injury. The majority of these complications were infectious, such as sepsis, wound infection, and abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5284039\"><span class=\"h2\">Pool suction entrapment and evisceration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a rare injury to which children are susceptible due to their small size. There have been 11 reported cases where intestinal prolapse, evisceration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amputation has occurred when a child has sat directly over a pool drain, forming a seal around the drain that applies and centers the negative pressure at the anus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The outcome of this potentially serious injury is related to the amount of intestine lost from the prolapse and injury or traumatic amputation. This injury has resulted in intestinal failure and subsequent death from complications of multivisceral transplantation. Entrapment and drowning may also result. Current United States federal legislation regulates the design of pool and spa drains in order to prevent this injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396510\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20396519\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients should follow the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, with life threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation addressed first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>).

For example, persistently unstable patients with blunt abdominal trauma and intraperitoneal fluid on FAST may warrant operative intervention in lieu of CT of the abdomen.
