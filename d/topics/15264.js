Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are most common in the first hours after an MI, and the incidence then declines in phases during the days, weeks, and months after the event. However, the arrhythmic risk remains elevated for years after an MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs-for-ventricular-arrhythmias-in-patients-with-a-prior-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. This temporal pattern reflects the electrophysiologic manifestations of the evolving interactions between ischemia, infarction, reperfusion, and scar formation.</p><p>Although all patients with a prior MI have an elevated risk of malignant arrhythmias, the magnitude of risk varies from patient to patient. Findings such as reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), reduced heart rate variability, abnormalities in the signal averaged ECG, and T wave alternans all predict a higher likelihood of SCD. On the other hand, the risk appears to be equivalent in patients with ST elevation and non-ST elevation infarctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs-for-ventricular-arrhythmias-in-patients-with-a-prior-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Due to the heightened risk of malignant arrhythmias after an acute MI, antiarrhythmic drugs for the purpose of preventing SCD have been studied in two major settings: in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, and as prophylaxis.</p><p>The role of antiarrhythmic drugs for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias after an acute MI will be reviewed here.
