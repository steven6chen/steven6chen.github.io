Treatment planning needs to incorporate the natural history of the disease and the risk of progression, since many of these cancers are biologically indolent and may never threaten the health or life of the patient. </p><p>For patients diagnosed with prostate cancer confined to the prostate, standard management options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy (external beam, brachytherapy), and, for carefully selected patients with very low or low-risk disease, active surveillance. </p><p>Key factors in choosing treatment for a man with low-risk prostate cancer include the likelihood of recurrence or metastasis following treatment (risk stratification), the patient's age and life expectancy, the presence or absence of significant comorbidity, and patient preferences.

Although there are fairly arbitrary boundaries between these prognostic categories, prostate cancer is a broad continuum. Risk stratification is combined with patient age, overall medical condition, the presence or absence of symptoms, and patient preferences in guiding initial therapy decisions.

To be classified as very low-risk, such patients must have a histologic grade group 1 (Gleason score &le;6 on biopsy) and a serum PSA &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Furthermore, the extent of disease within the prostate must be limited (ie, fewer than three positive biopsy cores with less than 50 percent involvement in any one core, and a PSA density less than 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL/gram)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk prostate cancer &ndash; Patients with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer either have disease limited to one lobe of the prostate (T2a) or no apparent tumor by digital rectal examination (T1; diagnosis based upon a biopsy only, with no abnormal findings on imaging or palpation), a serum PSA &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and a histologic grade group 1 (Gleason score &le;6). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate-risk prostate cancer &ndash; Men with intermediate-risk clinically localized prostate cancer can have more extensive tumor in the prostate (ie, involving more than one-half of one lobe of the prostate [T2b] or with bilateral disease [T2c] on initial examination or imaging), but without extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle involvement. In addition, patients with clinical stage T1 or T2a disease are classified as having intermediate-risk disease based upon a serum PSA &ge;10 and &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or a histologic grade group 2 or 3 (Gleason score 7).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk prostate cancer &ndash; Patients with high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer may have more extensive disease, based upon the presence of extraprostatic extension (T3a).

Standard treatment approaches include active surveillance in selected cases, radical prostatectomy, external beam RT, and brachytherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H833697\"><span class=\"h2\">Active surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active surveillance is defined as the postponement of immediate definitive therapy, with curative-intent treatment instituted if there is clinical evidence of disease progression. Active surveillance is an appropriate treatment option for some patients with prostate cancers that are small, have a low Gleason grade, and thus are thought to have a relatively low-risk of progression (TNM anatomic prognostic group I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a>)).</p><p>The goal of active surveillance is to avoid treatment-related complications for men whose cancers are not likely to progress. For many men, such disease either never requires treatment or treatment can be postponed for a prolonged period without significantly decreasing the chance of cure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Rationale'</a>.)</p><p>Active surveillance must be distinguished from &quot;watchful waiting&quot;, which is based upon the premise that some men will not benefit from definitive treatment of their localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients managed with watchful waiting, the decision is made at the outset that the patient is not a candidate for definitive therapy and to provide palliative treatment (typically androgen deprivation therapy, ADT) if and when symptomatic progression requires therapy. Watchful waiting may be an acceptable alternative for men with short life expectancy based upon age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substantial comorbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-in-elderly-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer in elderly patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H167060109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Survival impact of radical prostatectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the potential for side effects associated with aggressive treatment of indolent disease, active surveillance is an option for patients with very low-risk prostate cancer and an estimated life expectancy less than 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Immediate definitive treatment with radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy is an alternative for patients desiring a more aggressive approach. Active surveillance may also be an option for patients with low-risk disease and a life expectancy of less than ten years.</p><p>Although active surveillance avoids side effects in the short term, it does induce significant concerns and anxiety. Many men who initially choose active surveillance decide on definitive treatment within one to two years despite the absence of progression.</p><p>The key issues for patients who may be candidates for active surveillance include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate patient selection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency and type of monitoring required during surveillance and the ability and desire to comply with a surveillance schedule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for initiating definitive therapy</p><p/><p>These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H833704\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of RT for men with localized prostate cancer is to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing radiation to normal tissues. Both external beam RT and brachytherapy are widely used as a single modality for clinically localized low-risk prostate cancer. When used as the primary treatment modality, disease control with RT is similar to that with radical prostatectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The definition of biochemical failure after RT is complex since some normal prostatic glandular tissue remains and serum PSA levels are unlikely to fall to undetectable levels following a course of RT. The Phoenix criteria define biochemical failure after either external beam RT or brachytherapy as a PSA rise of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more above the nadir PSA after treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832001\"><span class=\"h3\">External beam RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External beam RT utilizes an external source of radiation to treat the prostate gland and a margin of adjacent normal tissue. External beam RT is generally used alone (ie, without androgen deprivation therapy or brachytherapy boost) for low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H833720\"><span class=\"h4\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) techniques are considered standard and have replaced older two dimensional approaches for the definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'External beam RT techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple technical refinements of 3D-CRT may facilitate the administration of higher doses of radiation to the tumor and decrease toxicity to normal tissues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is an advanced form of 3D-CRT that has replaced older 3D-CRT techniques in many areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IMRT utilizes a beam with varying intensity, in contrast to older forms of 3D-CRT techniques in which the dose rate is constant. Thus, IMRT can target a complex and irregular tumor volume more effectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Image-guided RT &ndash; Image-guided RT (IGRT) uses two- or three-dimensional imaging prior to each treatment to precisely locate the tumor and surrounding organs. IGRT thus further minimizes the margin of normal tissue that would otherwise need to be irradiated to allow for changing anatomic relationships.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton-beam RT &ndash; Proton-beam RT uses charged particles (protons) to deliver high doses of RT to the target volume while limiting the &quot;scatter&quot; dose received by surrounding tissues. Although proton beam therapy is being more widely used in men with prostate cancer as new treatment facilities become available, there is currently no evidence that this approach offers any advantages over IMRT or IGRT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Particle irradiation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H833727\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The morbidity of external beam RT is low with contemporary 3D-CRT techniques. The main complications are briefly reviewed here and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal &ndash; Acute radiation proctitis of moderate or greater severity is reported in approximately 20 percent of men, depending upon its definition, the radiation dose, and treatment volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This estimate is supported by an analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database that found that approximately 17 percent of patients required a procedure such as colonoscopy following external beam RT for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If the pelvic lymph nodes are included in the treatment volume, radiation enteritis may also be observed.

They can usually be controlled with antidiarrheal agents or topical antiinflammatory preparations. After RT is completed, acute symptoms usually subside within three to eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Long-term intestinal side effects persist in a low percentage of patients, manifested by persistent diarrhea, tenesmus, rectal urgency, or hematochezia. Rectal or anal strictures, ulcers, and perforation are rare.

Other factors that can contribute to erectile dysfunction in this population include older age, intercurrent diseases (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes), and the use of neoadjuvant ADT (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832036\"><span class=\"h3\">Brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy directly implants a radioactive source within the prostate to treat the cancer, thus providing the highest dose of radiation over a very limited distance. Brachytherapy maximizes irradiation of the tumor while minimizing radiation to normal structures. Brachytherapy requires only a one or a limited number of treatments, rather than the daily therapy required by external beam RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The radiation source is inserted into the prostate using a transperineal approach under transrectal ultrasound guidance. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low dose rate brachytherapy is delivered with permanently implanted radioactive seeds, typically using either iodine-125 or palladium-103. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dose rate brachytherapy uses a temporary radiation source such as iridium-192, which is inserted into the prostate through hollow catheters or needles that have been appropriately positioned and later removed. This form of brachytherapy typically requires a 48 hour hospitalization, in contrast to low dose rate brachytherapy, which can be completed in a single 90 minute outpatient procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832043\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriateness of brachytherapy for individual patients is based upon technical feasibility, the absence of coexistent urinary conditions, and the ability to adequately irradiate all disease. Brachytherapy alone is an appropriate option for men with low or intermediate-risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a>). Its suitability for high-risk patients is being expanded. Clinical trials that have completed enrollment are maturing, and at least one single-institution report demonstrates that the results of low dose rate brachytherapy are similar to those of other modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

A course of ADT prior to brachytherapy is sometimes used prior to brachytherapy to reduce the volume of the prostate gland, although there is no evidence to demonstrate that this approach adds value and has the down side of exposing patients to the acute side effects of ADT.

Postoperatively, detectable serum PSA using standard immunoassays is indicative of residual prostatic tissue, which presumably represents residual tumor tissue. The most widely accepted criterion for defining biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy is that of the American Urological Association (AUA), which defines a biochemical recurrence as a serum PSA &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> that is confirmed by a second determination with a PSA &ge;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Conservative measures (eg, pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback) are often used in the months following radical prostatectomy in an effort to control symptoms while sphincter function is returning.

Furthermore, patient estimates of the frequency of erectile dysfunction are generally higher than physician-reported data.</p><p>Erectile dysfunction can be treated with PDE-5 inhibitors, penile injection therapy, vacuum erection devices (VED), and implantation of a penile prosthesis.

Incontinence was much less common in patients treated with external beam RT or brachytherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bowel function &ndash; Bowel symptoms, primarily urgency and frequency, were reported by 10 to 20 percent of patients treated with either external beam RT or brachytherapy. Although the incidence was highest at two months after treatment, symptoms persisted at two years in 7 to 16 percent of cases. Bowel symptoms were rare after radical prostatectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sexual function &ndash; In patients managed with radical prostatectomy, some sexual dysfunction was present in approximately 90 percent of patients after two months and was a moderate or major problem in 60 percent. Some problems persisted in 60 percent after two years, and it was a moderate or big problem in 43 percent. For patients treated with RT (either external beam RT or brachytherapy), approximately 60 percent had some sexual dysfunction at two months, which persisted at two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ProtecT trial, patient-reported quality of life parameters were assessed through six years for urinary, sexual, and bowel function, as well as overall well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These results were consistent with other studies, showing somewhat worse urinary symptoms and sexual function related to surgery, and more bowel symptoms related to RT. There were no meaningful differences in overall health-related quality of life, and differences in specific parameters decreased with time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835294\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-TREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follow-up surveillance after initial definitive treatment is an important component of patient management.

However, this approach is associated with a need for close follow-up and may create significant anxiety, causing many patients to subsequently choose definitive intervention even in the absence of progressive disease. Radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy are acceptable alternatives for patients preferring immediate definitive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H833697\" class=\"local\">'Active surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of greater than 10 years, definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, or external beam radiation therapy [RT]), or active surveillance may all be appropriate options. The choice of a specific approach requires a consideration of the benefits and risks associated with each approach, taking into account the patient's individual preferences and comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H833704\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H833938\" class=\"local\">'Radical prostatectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H833697\" class=\"local\">'Active surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a more limited life expectancy (less than 10 years) we suggest active surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Bilateral nerve-sparing surgery diminishes but does not eliminate this risk.
