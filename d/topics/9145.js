Diabetes was discovered nine years ago on routine examination by his previous clinician when a random blood glucose was 193 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The glycated hemoglobin (A1C) was 8.6 percent. The patient was treated initially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> 5 mg every morning before breakfast.</p><p>Over the next two years, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> was increased incrementally to a dose of 10 mg twice daily before breakfast and supper. The blood glucose values improved and the A1C fell to the 7.3 to 7.8 percent range, the level depending, for the most part, on dietary adherence.</p><p>Three years ago, the A1C level rose to 8.4 percent and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> was added. The initial dose of 500 mg twice a day with meals was increased rapidly to 1000 mg twice a day. The A1C fell to the 7.2 to 7.7 percent range.</p><p>You saw the patient for the first time one year ago. The A1C was 7.8 percent, and you suggested the need for additional medication to reduce the A1C value to &lt;7.0 percent. The patient was reluctant to take another medication and said he would improve his diet. There is a buffet in the restaurant where he worked. Although he was eating three modest meals a day, he was nibbling constantly from approximately 4 PM until after midnight on crackers, peanuts, sausage, and cheese. He promised to limit himself to a modest snack at the end of each evening. The patient did not return during the intervening year but does so now because his blood glucose values have been rising despite his &quot;improved&quot; diet.</p><p>At the present time, the patient reports that he is no longer working in the restaurant and is following his diet. Breakfast is now two slices of whole grain bread and cappuccino. Lunch is a steak and a salad. Supper is often veal parmesan and a salad. He is no longer nibbling in the evening but does have a bedtime snack. He is pleased with his improved diet, notes that it has been a difficult transition, and is unwilling to make further changes.</p><p>He purchased an elliptical cross-trainer two months ago but has used it only three times. He did not bring his glucose diary but reports that his fasting blood glucose values at home are in the 150 to 165 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 to 9.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range with no tests later in the day. He notes an increased frequency of urination, attributed to drinking three beers a day.</p><p>On examination, the blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">130/70</span> mmHg supine and <span class=\"nowrap\">140/80</span> mmHg upright, the heart rate is <span class=\"nowrap\">72/minute,</span> regular. His weight is 227 lbs; the body mass index (BMI) is 33.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Funduscopic examination reveals no evidence of retinopathy. The mucous membranes are moist. Examination of the chest, heart, and abdomen reveals no abnormality. The dorsal pedal and posterior tibial pulses are present. There is no edema. The feet exhibit mild cock-up deformities of the toes of both feet, and a callus beneath the right first metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Light touch sensation is moderately reduced to the level of the distal calves. Vibration sensation is moderately reduced at the great toes and medial malleoli and is mildly reduced at the tibial tubercles. The deep tendon reflexes are absent in all extremities.</p><p>The patient's current medications are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> 1000 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> 10 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> 10 mg every morning, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 40 mg daily at bedtime, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 81 mg daily, a multivitamin once daily, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a> 10 mg daily as needed.</p><p>Fasting laboratory studies reveal the following: glucose 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (12.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, and carbon dioxide 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> triglycerides 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> total cholesterol 169 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 107 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> A1C 9.2 percent. The urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">microalbumin/creatinine</span> ratio is within normal limits.</p><p>You conclude that the patient has not been in acceptable metabolic control for years, based on the A1C values, and is now uncontrolled on full doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a>.</p><p>You encourage him to continue his diet and to increase his exercise, either by using the elliptical cross-trainer or by walking 30 to 35 minutes five to seven days a week.</p><p>You advise the patient to start an additional diabetes medication.
