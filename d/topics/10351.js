In an infant less than 37 weeks gestational age (GA), apneic spells are considered clinically significant if the episodes are greater than 20-second duration or when shorter episodes are accompanied by hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The frequency and severity of symptoms is inversely proportional to GA, and almost all extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW below 1000 g) are affected.</p><p>The management of apnea of prematurity will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of apnea of prematurity are discussed separately.

In most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), cardiac monitors, pulse oximeters, and impedance pneumography are used to monitor for apnea of prematurity and its associated bradycardia and hypoxemia. The accuracy of pneumography is limited by movement artifacts and the inability to detect obstructive apnea episodes, and is generally not used as the sole technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity#H372637470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of apnea of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive oxygen delivery and oxygen monitoring in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive oxygen delivery and oxygen monitoring in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Pulse oximetry'</a>.)</p><p>There are no data on the optimal threshold settings to determine significant apnea events.

CPAP also increases oxygenation by improving ventilation-perfusion matching and provides continuous distending pressure that optimizes FRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity#H89276269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of apnea of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Upper airway patency'</a>.)</p><p>nCPAP is often initiated in most preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation who are at risk for neonatal respiratory distress. However, for those infants who are not receiving nCPAP, nCPAP is initiated when apnea is significant (ie, respiratory pause greater than 20 seconds or a shorter respiratory pause accompanied by oxygen desaturation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity#H731875161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of apnea of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>nCPAP is applied using nasal prongs or, in the smallest infants, a nasal mask is used to minimize nasal trauma. In our practice, nCPAP is initiated at 4 to 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure. In some cases, patients have already been placed on nCPAP as an intervention for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Although data are lacking, some clinicians may increase nCPAP pressure in an attempt to optimize FRC based on estimating lung volume on chest radiography. However, many of these infants have good lung compliance, and pressures above 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O may overdistend the lungs or impair circulatory function. Changing prongs and nasal suctioning are minimized to avoid irritation, unless increased secretions obstruct nasal airflow.</p><p>Humidified high flow nasal cannulas have also been used to treat apnea of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nasal cannulae are an effective method to provide oxygen supplementation and deliver CPAP while minimizing patient discomfort, but high flow through nasal cannulas may provide unpredictable levels of CPAP. This technique and its limitations are discussed separately.

NIPPV may be a useful tool to augment the beneficial effects of CPAP in preterm infants with apnea.

The two methylxanthines used in apnea of prematurity are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">theophylline</a>. Caffeine is the preferred agent because of its longer half-life, wider margin of safety, and lower frequency of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H778060737\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Caffeine versus theophylline'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trials have established that methylxanthines are effective in the treatment of apnea of prematurity.</p><p>In a 2012 update of a systematic review, results from five trials that studied short-term effects of methylxanthine therapy demonstrated that patients treated with methylxanthine compared with those who received placebo were less likely to have apneic episodes (relative risk [RR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.60) and require assisted ventilation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A sixth trial, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Caffeine</a> for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial, was included in the updated review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the data from this trial were not pooled with the other studies because the trial's primary composite outcome was death and disability, and not apnea. In the CAP trial of 2006 preterm infants (birth weight [BW] between 500 and 1250 g), there was no difference in the rate of death, abnormal brain ultrasound, or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) between the treated and control groups. However, caffeine therapy was associated with reduced risk of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.66) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.89), earlier discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and a lower age at the time of last endotracheal tube use.</p><p>In a subsequent report of the CAP trial, for infants who required positive pressure ventilation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> benefit was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The earlier discontinuation of positive airway pressure support with caffeine indirectly suggests a decrease in the frequency of apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and the reduction of BPD suggests that caffeine might have a preventive role in the development of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although an initial study of the CAP trial reported a higher patient survival rate without neurodevelopmental disability at a corrected age of 18 to 21 months in patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> compared with controls (59.8 versus 53.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], a follow-up report demonstrated no clear difference in neurodevelopmental outcome between the two groups of survivors at a corrected age of five years (78.9 versus 75.2 percent), although longer-term benefit cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a subsequent publication based on data from the same cohort reported that neonatal caffeine reduced the risk of developmental coordination disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Limited data suggest early prophylactic caffeine in preterm infants may be beneficial.</p><p>A large retrospective study from the Canadian Neonatal Network of infants compared early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> within the first two days of life with late administration on or after the third day of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this cohort, 75 percent were given early caffeine, and the remaining patients received late administration of caffeine. In a multivariate analysis, neonates in the early caffeine group had a small but statistically significant lower risk of a composite outcome of death or BPD (31.5 versus 31.1 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98). However, most of this effect was due to a reduction in the incidence of BPD, as there was no difference in mortality (5.7 versus 5.8; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.7-1.37). In addition, the early caffeine group was less likely to develop PDA or undergo surgical intervention for PDA. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes including NEC, severe neurological injury, or severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).</p><p>Prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> is gaining increased acceptance in preterm infants at risk for BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We and other centers will frequently administer prophylactic caffeine therapy in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW below 1000 g) to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation, or to enhance extubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H778060737\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methylxanthines are competitive inhibitors of adenosine receptors. Because adenosine is an inhibitory neuromodulator of respiratory drive, blockage of its receptors by methylxanthines results in increased ventilatory responsiveness to carbon dioxide, reversal of central hypoxic depression of breathing, enhanced force of diaphragmatic contraction, and improved pharyngeal muscle tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Respiratory neural output is increased within five minutes after administration an intravenous loading dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In one study of 51 preterm infants (median gestational age [GA] 29 weeks), increased cerebral cortical activity, decreased transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure, and an increase in mean arterial pressure were observed during the two-hour period after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Caffeine may also reduce the effects of hypoxia on perinatal white matter injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some of the effects of caffeine may be due to its ability to inhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are mediated by the various adenosine receptor subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of methylxanthine treatment include feeding intolerance and tachycardia.

Theophylline can cause gastroesophageal reflux, perhaps because of delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; however, this does not present as a clinically significant problem.</p><p>Methylxanthines also increase metabolic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; however, the long-term impact of these effects is not known.

In an observational study of 101 preterm infants, the median caffeine citrate dose was 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (range 2.5 to 10.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> that resulted in levels from 3 to 23.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In 95 percent of samples, the level was between 5 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. Comparable results were seen in the 23 patients with renal dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen [BUN] levels) and in the 13 patients with elevated liver function studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H874091489\"><span class=\"h3\">Discontinuation of caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are lacking on when to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> therapy. Based on our experience and the natural course of apnea of prematurity, we discontinue caffeine when the infant reaches a postmenstrual age (PMA) between 32 and 34 weeks and there have been no apneic episodes requiring intervention for approximately five days. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It takes up to seven days for caffeine to be totally eliminated from the neonate. An alternate approach used in other centers is discontinuing caffeine at either 33 weeks PMA or if there has been no clinically significant episode of apnea for seven days, whichever comes first.</p><p>However, data from a multicenter trial of 105 enrolled preterm infants (GA &lt;32 weeks) suggest that prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> therapy beyond the routine clinical practice decreases the frequency and severity of intermittent hypoxemia. In this study, infants assigned to extended caffeine therapy compared with control infants assigned to routine discontinuation of caffeine had a lower mean rate of episodes of intermittent hypoxemia (defined as a decline in arterial oxygen saturation [SaO<sub>2</sub>] by at least 5 percent to less than 90 percent with a duration of &gt;5 seconds) at 35 weeks PMA (3.6 versus 8.4 events per hour) and 36 weeks PMA (3.8 versus 8.2 events per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Overall the rate of intermittent hypoxemia episodes progressively declined with increasing postnatal age and there was no difference in the mean rate between the two groups at 37 weeks, 38 weeks, and 39 weeks PMA. In addition, the caffeine-treated group had a lower mean time of SaO<sub>2</sub> below 90 percent at 35 and 36 weeks PMA. However, these episodes were not clinically apparent and their long-term effect remains uncertain. As a result, the authors caution that these preliminary results should not change current clinical practice.</p><p>Whenever <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> is discontinued, cardiorespiratory monitoring is continued and performed until the infant is discharged home, because the mean half-life of caffeine is approximately 87 hours in patients who are 35 weeks PMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Caffeine rarely needs to be reinstituted, but if there are frequent episodes of apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation, or if the infant requires intervention with a bag and mask, caffeine therapy may be restarted.

It appears that transfusion reduces the frequency of apnea. This was best illustrated in a study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) that demonstrated a decreased apnea rate after transfusion based on data from continuous computer monitoring of chest impedance and electrocardiographic and oximetry signals, and bedside nursing records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a study of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g), red blood cell (RBC) transfusions reduced the frequency and severity of episodes of intermittent hypoxemia (defined as oxygen saturation &le;80 percent for &ge;4 seconds and &le;3 minutes) up to 48 hours after transfusion in infants who were one week of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, there was no effect on the frequency or severity of hypoxemic events in patients less than seven days of age.</p><p>We consider packed RBC transfusion in infants with hematocrits less than 25 to 30 percent who have frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe apnea despite administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> therapy. The indications for transfusion in the preterm infants are discussed separately.

Control of breathing matures in almost all infants by 44 weeks PMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although pneumogram (two-channel impedance pneumography that measures chest wall movement and heart rate) is often used to evaluate apnea that persists beyond term PMA or when apnea is unusually severe, it is not useful in predicting which infants are at risk for severe cardiopulmonary events or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Multichannel comprehensive physiologic recording measures respiratory airflow, inspiratory effort, gastroesophageal reflux (via esophageal pH or multiple intraluminal impedance), and sleep state, and is used less commonly. It may be helpful when there is a clinical suspicion that the apnea may be due to other causes such as airway obstruction or seizure. These studies may be useful in demonstrating severity of episodes, and in the case of the multichannel recording, the occasional temporal relationship to reflux; however, they should not be performed routinely in preterm infants prior to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However if a preterm infant is ready for discharge, but mild apnea continues to be a concern, it remains uncertain what is the optimal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many of these infants have persistent mild bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> desaturation events that are detected by cardiorespiratory monitoring, which are associated with short undetected respiratory pauses as they remain below the apnea alarm threshold. These events are probably of no prognostic significance. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> has only recently been discontinued, we generally advise that the infant not be discharged home unless there is an event-free period of seven (as opposed to five) days to allow caffeine to be either eliminated or reach low subtherapeutic levels. (See <a href=\"#H778059835\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>Discharge criteria vary. Most centers wait until infants are free of apnea and off <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> therapy before discharge, while some may discharge infants home with cardiorespiratory monitoring, and on or off caffeine therapy. If the infant is to be monitored at home, prior to discharge the parents or primary home care provider must demonstrate proficiency in managing the monitor, providing stimulation, and performing cardiorespiratory resuscitation. Such home monitoring can almost always be discontinued at around 43 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Implementation of home cardiorespiratory monitoring in infants, including discontinuation, is discussed separately.
