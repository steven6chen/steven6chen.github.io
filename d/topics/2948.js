Today, most women with diabetes can have a safe pregnancy and delivery, similar to that of women without diabetes. This improvement is largely due to good blood glucose (sugar) control, which requires adherence to diet, frequent daily blood glucose monitoring, and frequent insulin adjustment.</p><p>This topic review discusses care of women with type 1 or 2 diabetes during pregnancy, as well as fetal and newborn issues. It does not address gestational diabetes, which is diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gestational diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD GLUCOSE CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose in the mother's blood crosses the placenta to provide energy for the baby; thus, high blood glucose levels in the mother lead to high blood glucose levels in the developing baby as well.</p><p>High blood glucose levels can cause several problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early in pregnancy, high glucose levels increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. These risks are highest when glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C or A1C) is &gt;8 percent or the average blood glucose is &gt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the last half of pregnancy and near delivery, high blood glucose levels can cause the baby's size and weight to be larger than average and increase the risk of complications during and after delivery (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Newborn issues'</a> below). In particular, women with large babies are more likely to have difficulty with a vaginal birth and have a higher chance of needing a cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the last half of pregnancy, women with diabetes are more prone to developing pregnancy-induced hypertension (preeclampsia) and an excessive amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios).</p><p/><p>These complications occur less frequently when blood glucose levels are well controlled, so it is important to have blood glucose as well controlled as possible before conception and throughout pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7453702\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures to control blood glucose</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with type 2 diabetes who have been treated with diet or oral medications generally require insulin for blood glucose control during pregnancy. Oral diabetes medications (eg, glyburide, metformin) can be used to manage type 2 diabetes during pregnancy in some cases. Women who are taking these medications when they become pregnant should speak with their health care provider about whether to continue oral medication or switch to insulin therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most women with type 1 diabetes will require two to four insulin injections per day. Women who use an insulin pump may continue to do so during pregnancy. Most women with diabetes need more insulin during pregnancy, especially during the last one-third of pregnancy (approximately 26 to 40 weeks of pregnancy) because the body becomes resistant to insulin as the pregnancy progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You can inject insulin any place in the abdomen where you can pinch an inch of belly fat, even in late pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent contact with health care providers is important for managing blood glucose levels and monitoring your health and your baby's health. The health care provider may want to review blood glucose levels and insulin doses one or more times per week; this can usually be done via telephone, email, or fax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nutritionist can help to plan a diet that provides the optimal number of calories; proportion of calories from carbohydrates, protein, and fat; and distribution of calories across <span class=\"nowrap\">snacks/meals</span> throughout the day. The optimal number of calories depends upon the woman's prepregnancy weight and activity level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise is an excellent way to control weight and blood glucose levels. Most women who exercised before pregnancy can continue to do so during pregnancy at the same or a slightly reduced pace. Moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, is recommended. Women who did not exercise previously may begin to exercise during pregnancy after consulting with their health care provider. Exercise intensity, type, and duration may need to be modified as the pregnancy progresses or if complications develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7453710\"><span class=\"h2\">Target blood glucose levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequent blood glucose monitoring is recommended during pregnancy, including testing before and after each meal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend the following goals when self-monitoring blood glucose levels during pregnancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting glucose concentrations &le;95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprandial glucose concentrations &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-hour postprandial glucose concentrations &le;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-hour postprandial glucose concentrations &le;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean capillary glucose 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the night, glucose levels &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p/><p>Hemoglobin A1C is a blood test that represents the average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. This test may be done once per month or once per trimester during pregnancy. Ideally, the goal is for the A1C to be at or near normal (6 percent or an average blood glucose of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76310 \">table 1</a>). However, attempting to be at or below 6 percent can cause frequent episodes of low blood glucose, which should be avoided. The target may be relaxed to &lt;7 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(53&nbsp;mmol/mol)</span> if necessary to avoid low blood glucose (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-low-blood-sugar-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Elevated levels of A1C at the time of conception and in the first trimester have been linked to an increased rate of birth defects, highlighting the need for preconception glucose control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, a woman with diabetes who is planning pregnancy should consult her health care provider well before she becomes pregnant. This provides an opportunity to make sure blood glucose levels are in optimal control, adjust medications if needed, evaluate and treat any medical complications related to diabetes (such as diabetes-related eye disease, thyroid disease, hypertension), and start folic acid supplementation (at least 400 mcg per day is recommended, starting at least one month before conception). Nearly all multiple vitamins contain this amount of folic acid or more. It is also an opportunity to discuss how pregnancy may affect diabetes and vice versa.</p><p>Care during pregnancy is a team effort involving an obstetrician and an endocrinologist or primary care provider who oversees insulin management and medical care. Some family practitioners perform all of these functions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinopathy refers to abnormal, leaky blood vessels in the light sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye (the retina). Retinopathy can lead to vision problems and even blindness in severe cases. Pregnancy can worsen diabetic retinopathy. The risk of worsening retinopathy during pregnancy is increased in those with the highest initial glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values and in women whose A1C falls rapidly during pregnancy.</p><p>The impact of pregnancy on diabetic retinopathy is mild and temporary for most women; the retina usually returns to its prepregnancy condition within several months after delivery. Nevertheless, all women with type 1 or 2 diabetes should have a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist before pregnancy and during the first trimester (first three months of pregnancy). In most cases, a follow-up examination is recommended every three months until delivery, depending upon the results of the initial examination.</p><p>Women with severe retinopathy are more likely to experience progression and complications. Eye examinations before and during pregnancy, along with close monitoring and treatment (as needed) of retinopathy can minimize the risk of vision loss. Some experts have recommended cesarean delivery for women with retinopathy, but this is controversial; most women can attempt a vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure may become elevated during pregnancy and should be measured at every appointment. High blood pressure often improves during the first half of pregnancy but returns to baseline or worsens in the second half.</p><p>Medications to treat high blood pressure during pregnancy may include methyldopa, calcium channel blocking agents, hydralazine, or beta blockers. Beta blockers can mask some symptoms of low blood glucose and should be used with caution.</p><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril, enalapril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (losartan, valsartan) are not safe for the fetus and should be discontinued in any woman planning pregnancy. If not discontinued before pregnancy, these drugs should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. An alternative, safer medication often needs to be substituted for the ACE or ARB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">High blood pressure complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy-related hypertension (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia) is more common in women with diabetes. Fortunately, most cases are mild. In severe cases, seizure, stroke, heart failure, kidney damage, and rarely, maternal death can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney function monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy does not cause diabetes-related kidney disease (called diabetic nephropathy), but it can worsen existing disease. Kidney function is monitored during pregnancy by urine and blood tests.</p><p>Diabetic nephropathy may increase the risk of developing other pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and babies who are small for their age (intrauterine growth restriction). Women with these complications have a higher frequency of hospitalization during pregnancy and cesarean delivery. Women with retinopathy and kidney disease are at increased risk of having a small baby because blood flow to the placenta may be reduced.</p><p>If a woman develops worsening nephropathy during pregnancy, it is usually temporary and reverts to the prepregnancy condition within several months of delivery. Nephropathy probably worsens because blood flow through the kidney increases by 50 percent during pregnancy, which increases the kidneys' workload. In addition, some women develop new pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, which further stresses the kidney.</p><p>Permanent kidney damage, including kidney failure, can occur in women who already have significant nephropathy before becoming pregnant. These women may require dialysis or kidney transplant sooner than a woman with severe chronic kidney disease who never becomes pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?

It is important that the due date is accurate because decisions about when to begin fetal testing and when to deliver the baby are based upon this date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">To screen for birth defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination is recommended at 18 to 20 weeks of gestation to screen for birth defects. The examination should pay particular attention to the spine and heart because these are the most common birth defects in infants of diabetic mothers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">To monitor amniotic fluid levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is also used to monitor the amount of amniotic fluid around the fetus; polyhydramnios is an abnormal increase in the amount of amniotic fluid. Polyhydramnios is more common in women with diabetes than in women without diabetes. Polyhydramnios related to diabetes is usually mild and does not cause problems. If the fluid levels become severely elevated, maternal discomfort, uterine contractions, premature rupture of the membranes (&quot;breaking the water&quot;), and preterm delivery can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">To monitor the baby's growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is also used to monitor the baby's growth and development throughout the pregnancy, although ultrasound estimates of the baby's weight can be off by 15 percent or more.</p><p>Macrosomia is a condition in which a baby weighs much more than average. It is more common in women with diabetes and occurs in 15 to 45 percent of these pregnancies. High fetal insulin levels, which can develop in response to elevated maternal blood glucose levels, are one potential cause of macrosomia since insulin stimulates fetal growth.</p><p>Cesarean delivery may be needed if labor does not progress normally because of the large size of the baby. In addition, macrosomic babies are at higher risk of being injured during delivery and may be delivered by cesarean delivery before labor if there is a concern that the baby's shoulders may be difficult to deliver through the mother's pelvis (called shoulder dystocia) (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Planning for delivery'</a> below). Shoulder dystocia occurs in one out of four macrosomic births in women with diabetes.</p><p>Intrauterine growth restriction refers to a baby that is not as large as expected for its age. It may be defined as birth weight &lt;10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile weight for gestational age and is less common than macrosomia in pregnancies with diabetes. Women with type 1 diabetes with preexisting microvascular complications or hypertension have a higher risk of growth restriction, compared with women without preexisting vascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for birth defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birth defects are more common in infants of women with high blood glucose levels before and during the early weeks of pregnancy; most birth defects develop by the 10<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. There is no particular birth defect caused by maternal diabetes; neural tube defects and heart defects are the most common birth defects. However, studies have shown that very good blood glucose control before becoming pregnant reduces the risk of birth defects to a level that is similar to that of women who do not have diabetes (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Importance of blood glucose control'</a> above). In addition, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, women planning pregnancy should begin taking folic acid supplements in a multivitamin or prenatal vitamin one to two months prior to attempting to conceive and continue supplementation at least through the first trimester.</p><p>Women with diabetes do not have a higher risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome, than women without diabetes. The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome primarily depends on the mother's age and whether there is a family history of Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=should-i-have-a-screening-test-for-down-syndrome-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close monitoring of the fetus is recommended during the third trimester, usually starting at 32 to 34 weeks of pregnancy. This usually includes weekly to twice-weekly nonstress testing. This is done by monitoring the baby's heart rate with a small device that is placed on the mother's abdomen. The device uses sound waves (ultrasound) to measure the baby's heart rate over time, usually for 20 to 30 minutes.</p><p>Normally, the baby's baseline heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute and should increase above its baseline by at least 15 beats per minute for 15 seconds when the baby moves.</p><p>The test is considered reassuring (called &quot;reactive&quot;) if two or more fetal heart rate increases are seen within a 20-minute period. Further testing may be needed if these increases are not seen after monitoring for 40 minutes.</p><p>Sometimes ultrasound is used to monitor fetal well-being. This test is called a biophysical profile and uses ultrasound to check the baby's amniotic fluid volume, number of body movements, tone, and duration of breathing-type movements. Some practitioners use a so-called &quot;modified biophysical profile,&quot; consisting of a non-stress test and amniotic fluid assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PLANNING FOR DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman and her obstetrician may decide to schedule the date of her delivery (either an induction of labor or cesarean delivery), especially if there are risk factors for an adverse maternal or fetal outcome, such as increased blood glucose levels, nephropathy, worsening retinopathy, high blood pressure, or preeclampsia, or if the baby is smaller or larger than normal.</p><p>If the fetus appears to be very large (based upon ultrasound measurements), a woman and her obstetrician may consider cesarean delivery to avoid possible trauma from shoulder dystocia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests that a woman and her physician consider a planned cesarean delivery if the baby's estimated weight (by ultrasound measurement) is greater than 4500 grams (9 lbs, 14 oz). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Waiting for labor to start on its own is reasonable if blood glucose levels are well controlled and the mother and baby are doing well. However, extending pregnancy beyond 40 to 41 weeks of gestation is generally not recommended; some practitioners routinely induce labor between 39 and 40 weeks in all women with type 1 or 2 diabetes.</p><p>The risk of stillbirth for pregnant women with well-controlled diabetes is very low and is about the same as in women without diabetes (less than 1 percent). The mortality (death) rate in infants of diabetic women is slightly higher than in women without diabetes (2 versus 1 percent). This is mostly due to a higher rate of serious birth defects in infants of diabetic mothers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">INFANT CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infant of the diabetic mother is at risk for several problems in the newborn period, such as low blood glucose levels, jaundice, breathing problems, excessive red blood cells (polycythemia), low calcium level, and heart problems. These problems are more common when the mother's blood glucose levels have been high throughout the pregnancy. Most of these problems resolve within a few hours or days after delivery. Infants of diabetic mothers are often evaluated in a special care nursery to monitor for these potential problems.</p><p>Infants of mothers with diabetes are at higher risk of having difficulties with breathing, especially if the baby is born earlier than 39 weeks. This is because the lungs appear to develop more slowly in infants of women with diabetes. The risk of breathing problems is highest when maternal blood glucose levels have been high near the time of delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Will my child develop diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The children of parents with diabetes are at increased risk of developing the same type of diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children of a father with type 1 diabetes have a 1 in 17 risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Children of a mother with type 1 diabetes have a 1 in 25 risk if, at the time of pregnancy, the mother is less than 25 years of age. The risk is 1 in 100 risk if the mother is 25 years of age or older. These risks are doubled if the affected parent developed diabetes before age 11. If both parents have type 1 diabetes, the child's risk is 1 in 4 to 10 (10 to 25 percent risk).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of type 2 diabetes is increased in children of a parent with type 2 diabetes, especially if both parents are affected. The risk depends upon environmental and behavioral factors, such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle, as well as the genetic susceptibility.

However, it is important to pay close attention to blood glucose levels because insulin requirements can fall rapidly in the first few days after delivery; some women require little or no insulin. Insulin requirements usually return to near-prepregnancy levels within 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all women (with and without diabetes), breastfeeding is strongly encouraged because it benefits both the infant and the mother. Insulin requirements may be lower while breastfeeding, and frequent blood glucose monitoring is important to prevent severe hypoglycemia.
