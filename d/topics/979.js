However, there are a few important differences. As an example, most starving patients describe lethargy and inability to exercise, whereas patients with anorexia nervosa may exercise excessively in an attempt to lose weight. Patients with anorexia nervosa are often not concerned about their marked weight loss, whereas patients who lose weight from other causes usually express concern. In addition, weight loss due to malabsorption usually presents with diarrhea or symptoms of adrenergic excess, such as diaphoresis and rapid pulse, which are typically absent in anorexia nervosa (purging may lead to dehydration and tachycardia, and laxative abuse to diarrhea). Further, the diet of patients with anorexia nervosa usually contains protein and vitamins even though their total caloric intake is very low. Thus, patients are often spared the starvation-related complications of malnutrition observed in developing countries (eg, kwashiorkor and marasmus).</p><p>Illnesses other than anorexia nervosa can be diagnosed or excluded through the history, physical examination, and laboratory screening tests. The guiding principle is that a complex and expensive workup to rule out numerous medical disorders is rarely, if ever, indicated. The etiology and evaluation of weight loss; clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption; and etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of secondary amenorrhea are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with unintentional weight loss&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)

Clinical judgment and some degree of individualization is required.</p><p>Based upon our clinical experience, most medical complications of anorexia nervosa are managed as inpatients or in residential care facilities. Other treatment settings that may be available include intensive outpatient (eg, two to three hours per weekday) and partial hospital (day program that provides six to eight hours of outpatient care per weekday) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73092 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-evaluation-for-medical-complications-and-criteria-for-hospitalization-to-manage-these-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In addition, some medical complications of anorexia nervosa require inpatient treatment on an internal medicine, psychiatric, or combined unit. The choice depends upon the patient&rsquo;s weight, medical and psychiatric status, and available resources. </p><p>Anorexia nervosa is associated with numerous general medical complications that are directly attributable to weight loss and malnutrition. The complications affect most major organ systems and often include physiologic disturbances such as hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, and amenorrhea.

The clinician treating these complications should have expertise in managing them and is often part of a team that includes specialists in psychiatry and nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-evaluation-for-medical-complications-and-criteria-for-hospitalization-to-manage-these-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
