The discovery that sickle hemoglobin has an abnormal electrophoretic mobility began the era of molecular medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, research on hemoglobin provided early and important information about the organization and regulation of genes as well as insights as to how ontogeny affects gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Proteins with hemoglobin-like function (ie, hemoglobin motifs) can be found in the most ancient unicellular plants and animals and have evolved over hundreds of millions of years into gas transport proteins through the processes of gene duplication, conversion, divergence, and inactivating mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In man, these processes have culminated in hemoglobin gene clusters on separate chromosomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>), whose expression is developmentally regulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure'</a> below.)</p><p>All human hemoglobin genes contain three exons separated by two introns; the exons may encode distinct functional domains of the molecule. The tetrameric globular structure of hemoglobin is adapted to the physiology of complex organisms and their needs for regulation of oxygen delivery far better than the primitive globins hemocyanin or erythrocruorin, and single chain globins such as muscle myoglobin, cytoglobin, and neuroglobin.</p><p>The primary amino acid structure of the constituent globin chains dictates the quaternary structure, which, in turn, is the basis of the ability of hemoglobin to rapidly bind oxygen in the lungs and unload it in the tissues. Such function may be altered by the presence of additional mutations, alterations in pH, and levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG, previously called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or 2,3-DPG). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen affinity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult hemoglobin (HbA) is a 64.4 kd heterotetramer consisting of two pairs of globin polypeptide chains: one pair of alpha chains, and one pair of non-alpha chains. The hemoglobin tetramer is a globular molecule (5.0 x 5.4 x 6.4 nm) with a single axis of symmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The polypeptide chains are folded such that the four heme groups lie in clefts on the surface of the molecule equidistant from one another. Alpha-globin chains contain 141 amino acids (residues) while the beta-like chains contain 146 amino acids. Approximately 75 percent of hemoglobin is in the form of an alpha helix. The nonhelical stretches permit folding of the polypeptide upon itself. Individual residues can be assigned to one of eight helices (A to H) or to adjacent nonhelical stretches. The various globin chains are designated by Greek letters, which are used to describe the particular hemoglobin (eg, HbA <span class=\"nowrap\">[alpha2/beta2]</span> is composed of two alpha-globin chains and two beta-globin chains).</p><p>A homotetramer of only alpha-globin chains is thought to be too unstable to occur. However, when alpha chains are either absent or present in reduced amounts, beta and gamma homotetramers (HbH [beta4] and Bart's hemoglobin [gamma4], respectively) can be found, although they lack cooperativity and function poorly in oxygen transport. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two copies of the alpha-globin gene (HBA2, HBA1) are located on chromosome 16 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>) along with the embryonic zeta gene (HBZ). There is no substitute for alpha-globin in the formation of any of the normal hemoglobins (Hb) present following birth (eg, HbA, HbA2, and HbF). Thus, absence of alpha-globin, as seen when all four alpha-globin genes are inactive or deleted, is incompatible with extrauterine life, except when extraordinary measures such as stem cell transplantation are taken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin Bart's'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The single beta-globin gene (HBB) resides on chromosome 11 within a gene cluster that also contains an embryonic beta-like gene, the epsilon gene (HBE1), the duplicated and nearly identical fetal, or gamma-globin genes (HBG2, HBG1), and the poorly expressed delta-globin gene (HBD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heme group, consisting of a single molecule of protoporphyrin IX coordinately bound to a single ferrous (Fe<sup>++</sup>) ion, is linked covalently at a specific site to each globin chain. If the iron is oxidized to the ferric state (Fe<sup>+++</sup>), the protein is called methemoglobin. Heme iron is linked covalently to a histidine at the eighth residue of the F helix (His F8), at residue 87 of the alpha chain and residue 92 of the beta chain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58767 \">figure 2</a>). Mutations resulting in changes in some of the amino acids surrounding heme result in unstable hemoglobins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;, section on 'Altered heme-globin interactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residues that have charged side groups, such as lysine, arginine, and glutamic acid, lie on the surface of the molecule in contact with the surrounding water solvent. Exposure of the hydrophilic (charged) amino acids to the aqueous milieu is an important determinant of the solubility of hemoglobin within the red blood cell and of the prevention of precipitation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygenation and deoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygenation and deoxygenation of hemoglobin occur at the heme iron. Upon deoxygenation, the hemoglobin molecule undergoes a marked change in conformation, as the beta chains rotate apart by approximately 0.7 nm. Deoxyhemoglobin is stabilized in a constrained or tense (T) configuration by inter- and intra-subunit salt bonds. These salt bonds are responsible for the Bohr effect and for the binding of 2,3-BPG, both of which modify oxygen affinity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen affinity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>Upon the addition of oxygen, these salt bonds are sequentially broken and the fully oxygenated hemoglobin is in the relaxed (R) configuration. In this state, there is less bonding energy between the subunits, and the oxygenated molecule is able to dissociate reversibly, forming two alpha-beta dimers. It is these dimers that are bound to haptoglobin and can be filtered at the glomerulus when cell-free hemoglobin is present in the circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTION OF HEMOGLOBIN A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal physiologic function of hemoglobin is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues from the lungs, although another function, namely delivery of nitric oxide and regulation of vasomotor tone, has been postulated (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nitric oxide transport'</a> below). </p><p>Oxygenation of hemoglobin as a function of the oxygen concentration is expressed by a sigmoid hemoglobin-oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">association/dissociation</span> curve, which has two characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The shape of this curve is due to a phenomenon known as cooperativity, whereby partial saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen increases the affinity of the remaining hemes for oxygen. Heme proteins such as the homotetrameric hemoglobins H (beta4) and Bart's (gamma4) lack the cooperativity of normal tetrameric hemoglobins and have a hyperbolic curve. Myoglobin exists in muscle as a monomer and exhibits no cooperativity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen can be modified (ie, shifted to the right or left) by various exogenous factors such as pH, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and temperature, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen affinity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cooperativity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenomenon of cooperativity is due to the fact that the T (tense) form of hemoglobin has a lower affinity for ligands such as oxygen and carbon monoxide (CO) than the R (relaxed) form. The heme-heme interaction, a function of the tetrameric nature of hemoglobin, implies that the four heme groups do not undergo simultaneous oxygenation or deoxygenation; instead, the state of each individual heme with regard to associated oxygen influences the binding of oxygen to the other heme groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;, section on 'Cooperativity'</a>.)</p><p>The totally deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer is slow to bind the first oxygen molecule, but the reaction with oxygen accelerates as oxygenation proceeds. At some point during the sequential addition of oxygen to the four hemes of the molecule, a transition from the T to the R conformation occurs. At this point, the oxygen affinity of the partially liganded molecule increases markedly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When two or three molecules of oxygen are bound, the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha1/beta2</span> interface is sufficiently destabilized to flip the quaternary structure from T to R, thereby increasing the affinity of the remaining hemes for oxygen. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Oxygenation and deoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen affinity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen affinity is usually designated by the P<sub>50</sub>, which is the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50 percent saturated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 3</a>). The P<sub>50</sub> is normally 27 mmHg at 37&deg;C and pH 7.4. Oxygen affinity is modulated by pH, CO<sub>2</sub>, 2,3-BPG and temperature, as discussed below. These changes are important in the body's ability to adapt to hypoxia and anemia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'2,3-bisphosphoglycerate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Temperature'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shift to the right in the hemoglobin-oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">association/dissociation</span> curve, with a higher P<sub>50</sub>, indicates that a larger partial pressure of oxygen is required to saturate hemoglobin at the level of the lungs (ie, reduced oxygen affinity). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, a shift to the left, with a lower P<sub>50</sub>, indicates that a lower partial pressure of oxygen is required to saturate hemoglobin (ie, increased oxygen affinity).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">pH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin increases as a function of pH over a range of 6.0 to 8.5, a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A corollary of this relationship is that deoxyhemoglobin binds protons more strongly than does oxyhemoglobin. Under physiologic conditions, a molecule of hemoglobin releases approximately 2.8 protons upon oxygenation.</p><p>A substantial portion of the Bohr effect is due to an intrasubunit salt bond between the positively charged imidazole of beta146 histidine and the negatively charged carboxyl of beta94 aspartate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This salt bridge helps to stabilize the deoxy conformation. When hemoglobin is oxygenated, these bonds are broken and protons are released.</p><p>There are two major physiologic consequences of the Bohr effect. First, oxygen is more easily released at the tissue level due to a higher carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) tension and a lower pH. Second, oxygen is more easily taken up in the pulmonary circulation where the pH is higher due to the efflux of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbamino adducts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CO<sub>2</sub> can react with free amino groups at the N termini of the alpha and beta chains to form carbamino complexes. Deoxyhemoglobin forms these complexes more readily than oxyhemoglobin; thus, at any given pH, CO<sub>2</sub> lowers oxygen affinity. Normally, approximately 10 percent of CO<sub>2</sub> is transported to the lungs in the form of carbamino hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG, previously called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or 2,3-DPG) is a potent modulator of the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. It is normally present in red cells at a concentration of approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> and is synthesized from 1,3-BPG in the glycolytic pathway under the influence of the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83968 \">figure 4</a>). 2,3-BPG is a polyanion that binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin in a 1:1 molar ratio but weakly to oxyhemoglobin, as described by the following reaction:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hb.BPG &#160;+ &#160;4O2 &#160;&lt;&mdash;&mdash;&gt; &#160; Hb(O2)4 &#160;+ &#160;BPG</p></div></div><p/><p>Binding takes place in the central cavity between the two beta chains where the negative charges of 2,3-BPG are neutralized by the beta NH2 terminus histidine, beta82 lysine, and beta143 histidine. Binding to deoxyhemoglobin helps to stabilize the tense (T) structure of hemoglobin and decrease oxygen affinity. In oxyhemoglobin, the H helices of the beta chains are insufficiently spread apart to permit firm binding of 2,3-BPG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing levels of 2,3-BPG decrease oxygen affinity, shift the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve to the right, and increase the delivery of oxygen to tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased levels of 2,3-BPG due to a BPGM mutation lead to a leftward shift in the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, decreasing the delivery of oxygen to tissues. This results in a compensatory increased production of erythropoietin, stimulating erythropoiesis and the ultimate development of autosomal dominant erythrocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

The decrease in oxygen affinity at elevated body temperature helps to unload oxygen at the tissue at a time when oxygen requirement is likely to be increased.</p><p>The position and shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve define the amount of oxygen that is unloaded at the tissue at any given blood flow and hemoglobin concentration. When the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is right-shifted, red cells have enhanced O<sub>2</sub> release when going from a normal arterial pO<sub>2</sub> (95 mmHg) to a normal mixed venous pO<sub>2</sub> (40 mmHg). This is due to the fact that with this decrease in pO<sub>2</sub>, a steeper portion of the curve is encompassed. This issue relates to several clinical situations. Certain hemoglobin mutants have a left-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and the decreased oxygen release stimulates erythropoietin production and causes erythrocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-hemoglobin-oxygen-affinity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of hemoglobin oxygen affinity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator. The oxidized nitrosyl derivative of NO can form adducts with proteins, including sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues. Hemoglobin contains a highly conserved cysteine on the beta subunit, close to the heme pocket: beta93cys. The -SH group of this conserved cysteine has free access to modification when hemoglobin is oxygenated but is sterically blocked when the molecule is deoxygenated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that NO produced in the pulmonary circulation binds to the Cys -SH group forming the S-nitrosothiol (SNO) derivative. As blood traverses tissues and unloads oxygen, NO is ejected from hemoglobin and diffuses out of the red blood cell into the lumen of arterioles and capillaries where it serves as a local vasodilating agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>] and may also serve to control the respiratory drive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70886 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;, section on 'Peripheral chemoreceptors'</a>.)</p><p>Although there is some evidence in support of this hypothesis, many more rigorous biochemical and physiologic measurements are required to prove an important role in vivo. It will be difficult to critically assess whether there is oxygen-linked net release of NO from red cells during the rapid transit time from arteries through the precapillary circulation (less than one-half of a second).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1062835623\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOGLOBIN A2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2 to 3 percent of the hemoglobin in normal adult red blood cells is HbA2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/delta2)</span>.

The half-life of delta-globin mRNA is less than one-third that of beta-globin mRNA, probably due to changes in the delta mRNA sequence in the 3' untranslated region. However, this mechanism alone does not account for the vastly reduced concentration of HbA2 compared with HbA. HbA and HbA2 have almost identical molecular stability, making it unlikely that differential post-translational survival of the two molecules accounts for this difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a mutation in the Kruppel-like factor 1 (Klf1) binding site (CACCC box) within the delta-globin proximal promoter region that may account for the reduced synthesis of HbA2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Two implicated loci were the HBS1L-MYB locus on chromosome 6q, which has been shown to have pleiotropic effects on other hematologic traits and to be associated with HbF levels, and a second locus on chromosome 11p surrounding HBB, the gene encoding beta-globin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similar studies in sickle cell anemia confirmed the association with the HBS1L-MYB locus and also found an association with BCL11A on chromosome 2p. The effects of these loci on HbA2 levels were mediated by their effects on HbF levels. An additional association was found between polymorphisms downstream of the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11; this effect was independent of HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The relative rate of synthesis of this minor hemoglobin component is markedly curtailed in the final stages of erythroid development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

They have evolved to permit oxygen transport from amniotic fluid, prior to establishment of a placental circulation to which HbF is adapted. They are characterized by increased oxygen binding (P<sub>50</sub> 4 to 12 mmHg) and slightly reduced cooperativity (h = 1.9 to 2.3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 3</a>). This serves to provide needed oxygen during embryogenesis in a low-oxygen environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These features of embryonic hemoglobins might be a consequence of the weak subunit assembly into tetrameric hemoglobin when these hemoglobins are compared with adult hemoglobin or HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In the presence of organic phosphates, the oxygen affinities of <span class=\"nowrap\">zeta2/epsilon2</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha2/epsilon2</span> are lowered; in the case of Gower II this occurs to a lesser extent than HbA. This demonstrates that the zeta and epsilon chains do not completely interfere with the binding of 2,3 BPG, but differences with HbA do exist. Hb Portland does not bind phosphates effectively (see below), since its central cavity is formed by gamma chains.</p><p>Gower II hemoglobin has reduced sensitivity to chloride iron (Cl-). It is indispensable to reduce the destabilizing effect of an excess of positive charges in the central cavity by Cl- binding in order to preserve the physiological oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Thus, alterations in Cl- binding are bound to lead to functional alterations. According to crystallographic studies, the tertiary structure of the alpha chain in Hb Gower II is unchanged compared with HbA and HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The epsilon chain has a structure very similar to the beta chain with small differences in the N terminus and the A helix. The Cl- binding sites involve the polar residues within the central cavities.</p><p>The epsilon-globin chain has a substitution of lysine at the epsilon87 position, compared with the beta chain, which has a threonine. This is reminiscent of the gamma and delta chains, which also have substitutions at this site and which are both anti-sickling hemoglobins. Although crystallography does not support a micro-conformational change at this site, such a change might occur in solution and would predict that embryonic hemoglobins containing epsilon chains are anti-sickling, as this residue is critical for HbS polymerization and its mutation to glutamine has been incorporated into the lentiviral vectors used in gene therapy of beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

These hemoglobins are formed slowly and continuously throughout the 120-day life span of the red cell. Consequently, individuals who have increased red cell turnover (hemolysis) have decreased levels of these minor hemoglobin components.

Examples include cyanate adducts in uremic patients, acetaldehyde adducts in individuals with excess alcohol intake, and porphyrin-substituted hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-normal-hemoglobins/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18236830\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF GLOBIN GENE MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major globin genes are differentially expressed during embryonic and fetal development and change further following birth. For this reason, defects of a particular globin gene have different effects at different developmental stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations of the alpha-globin genes (<em>HBA2</em>, <em>HBA1</em>) are phenotypically apparent early in development (ie, after approximately the 14<sup>th</sup> week of gestation). Any associated phenotype is likely to persist throughout fetal, neonatal, and adult life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H2697253778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Alpha thalassemias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gamma-globin gene (<em>HBG2</em>, <em>HBG1</em>) defects appear in the fetus, can linger into the neonatal period, and, if severe, can cause fetal loss. If mild, gamma-globin gene defects may cause no problems in later life as HbF (alpha2gamma2) is a minor hemoglobin in normal children and adults. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delta-globin gene (<em>HBD</em>) mutations become detectable late in the first year of life as this gene is poorly expressed during intrauterine development. Nevertheless, such mutations have no ill effects as the enfeebled delta gene is expressed at very low levels (approximately 3 percent) compared with the beta-globin gene (96 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the beta-globin gene (<em>HBB</em>), such as those encoding sickle hemoglobin (HbS) or beta thalassemia, become apparent only after the switch from HbF <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/gamma2)</span> to HbA <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/beta2)</span>. They are compatible with normal fetal survival and may not become apparent until the middle to late months of the first year of life.

There is no substitute for alpha-globin in the formation of any of the normal hemoglobins following birth. Thus, absence of any alpha-globin is generally incompatible with extrauterine life. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Structure'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adult hemoglobin</strong> &ndash; In red cells of normal adults and in children more than six months of age, adult hemoglobin (HbA, <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha2/beta2)</span> accounts for approximately 96 percent of total hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Function of hemoglobin A'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal hemoglobin</strong> &ndash; Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">2/gamma2)</span> is the main hemoglobin during late fetal life. The concentration of HbF in a full-term infant is approximately 60 to 80 percent, decreasing to less than 1 percent in the adult. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fetal hemoglobin'</a> above.) Disorders associated with increased levels of HbF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in health and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin A2</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2, <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha2/delta2)</span> is a minor hemoglobin throughout fetal and adult life. Its concentration in the normal adult is approximately 2 to 3 percent. Disorders associated with increased or decreased HbA2 levels are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H1062835623\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin A2'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin A1c</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin A1c differs from HbA only in the addition of glucose molecules. It accounts for approximately 3 percent of total hemoglobin in normal adult red cells and is increased in individuals with diabetes mellitus, especially those whose diabetes is poorly controlled.
