Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. Effective palliative care of patients with advanced dementia can improve patients' symptoms, lessen caregiver burden, and help ensure that treatment decisions are well informed and weighed in the context of patient and family goals and needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will review aspects of palliative care that are specific to patients with advanced dementia. Other management issues in patients with dementia, such as behavioral symptoms and safety and societal concerns, are discussed elsewhere.

In the United States in 2012, an estimated 5.2 million individuals over 65 years of age had Alzheimer disease (AD), a number that is expected to reach 6.7 million by 2025 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Mortality due to AD in the US increased by 39 percent between 2000 and 2010, and AD was the fifth leading cause of death among decedents &gt;65 years in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) is a validated and reliable instrument describing the clinical progression of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Scores range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater dementia severity. Stage 7 of the GDS provides a useful description of advanced dementia: profound memory deficits (inability to recognize family members), speech limited to fewer than five words, total functional dependence, incontinence, and inability to ambulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The last years of life in advanced dementia are characterized by a prolonged trajectory of severe disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a prospective validation study of 606 nursing home residents with advanced dementia, ADEPT had a specificity of 89 percent and a sensitivity of 27 percent for predicting death within six months, which was only slightly better than current US Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines, which had the same specificity but a lower sensitivity (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Given its benefits, hospice referral should be included in the treatment options for patients with advanced dementia and their families.

It is emotional, value-laden, frequently reliant on substitute decision-making if clear plans had not been made by the patient prior to cognitive decline, based on limited outcome data, and influenced by many external factors. Faced with these challenges, practitioners should be prepared to provide informative and compassionate decision support. </p><p>Decision-making should follow an ethical framework reflecting a balance of benefits and burdens, and respect for autonomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients with advanced dementia have profound cognitive impairment, and decision-making therefore becomes the responsibility of their designated health care proxies. Proxies need to be advised that their decisions should reflect their perceptions of the patients' wishes as guided by the steps for substitute-decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H616076112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of advance directives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making a substituted judgment </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weighing what is in patients' best interests</p><p/><p>Treatments received by patients with advanced dementia should align with their desired primary goals of care. Some patients may wish to receive all available medical treatments with the goal of living as long as possible; others may wish to receive only treatments that relieve distressing symptoms with the goal of maximizing comfort. Somewhere in between, patients may opt to receive potentially curative but conservative treatments (ie, oral antibiotics), with the goal of returning to their baseline status prior to the acute illness. In a prospective study of 323 nursing home patients with advanced dementia, over 90 percent of proxies stated that comfort was the main goal of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>These approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Palliative care services, including aggressive symptom management, are routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses. Thus, patients who wish to pursue potentially life-prolonging care can still receive treatments to reduce discomfort, and those opting for comfort-focused care for a particular problem may still receive potentially curative treatment for another. Within the context of these broad goals, treatment decisions must be tailored to each individual and clinical situation.

Depression, while difficult to diagnose in advanced dementia, may also manifest as disinterest in food or refusal to eat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-etiology-and-pathogenesis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of late-life unipolar depression&quot;, section on 'Alzheimer disease and other dementias'</a>.) </p><p>At the onset of eating problems in a patient with advanced dementia, acute medical problems (eg, infection, stroke, medication side effects) need to be considered and excluded. Patients with dysphagia caused by a stroke typically have acute neurologic signs and symptoms that extend beyond the dysphagia, such as dysarthria, asymmetrical facial or limb weakness, or new aphasia.

For reasons that will be discussed below, we suggest ongoing hand feeding rather than tube feeding as the preferred approach to nutritional support in patients with advanced dementia. This is the recommended approach of the American Geriatrics Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], the Canadian Geriatrics Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and the American Board of Internal Medicine&rsquo;s Choosing Wisely Campaign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>The main goal of continued oral feeding is to provide food and drink to the extent that it is enjoyable for the patient. This option focuses on comfort. The objective of providing a prescribed daily caloric intake is abandoned in favor of palliation. Benefits of hand feeding include the continued pleasure of tasting food, insofar as it remains comfortable for the patient, and interaction with family members and caregivers during feeding times. Conscientious hand-feeding is labor intensive, requiring approximately 45 to 90 minutes per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Strategies that can improve the success of hand feeding include minimizing distractions, emphasizing sensory clues, providing assistive feeding utensils, optimizing patient positioning, and scheduling meals at times of greatest alertness and function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The option of continued hand feeding does not mean medical care is stopped. Patients can continue to receive a host of palliative treatments and potentially curative treatments for other problems (ie, antibiotics for infections, surgical repair of a hip fracture to reduce pain).</p><p>Long-term tube feeding is most often achieved by the placement of a PEG tube. Purported benefits for tube feeding in advanced dementia include prolonging life, preventing aspiration, improving malnutrition and its sequelae (ie, pressure sores), and alleviating symptoms of hunger or thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>However, a systematic review in 2009 that included seven observational studies found that the available evidence failed to demonstrate that enteral tube feeding achieved any of these outcomes in patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. It is important to note, however, that there have been no randomized trials of tube feeding versus continued oral feeding in advanced dementia. The highest quality data are derived from observational studies that may be limited by selection bias. Acknowledging this limitation, multiple large cohort studies have found that tube feeding in advanced dementia does not prolong survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/28,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,52,53</a>]. As an example, in a nationwide study of 36,492 nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment, 5.4 percent of patients underwent insertion of a feeding tube within a year following the onset of feeding problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In a multivariate analysis, there was no difference in survival between those who did and did not undergo feeding tube insertion (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.94-1.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The same study found that early versus late feeding tube insertion relative to the onset of eating problems also was not associated with improved survival. </p><p>Tube feeding has also not been shown to improve nutritional status or pressure ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Feeding tubes will not prevent aspiration among severely demented patients who aspirate, in part because they aspirate oral secretions and regurgitated gastric contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. While it is impossible to know whether advanced dementia patients experience hunger or thirst, an observational study found no measurable increase in discomfort following a decision to withhold artificial nutrition or hydration among patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>In additional to the general risks associated with PEG-tube placement, proxies should be apprised of specific risks in advanced dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrostomy-tubes-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrostomy tubes: Complications and their management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tube dislodgement, blockage, or leakage was the most common reason for burdensome emergency department transfers in a large prospective study of nursing home patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitated demented patients may require physical or chemical restraints to prevent tube dislodgment, and tube feeding has been shown to be associated with greater use of restraints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a propensity-matched cohort study of 1124 hospitalized nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment and feeding problems, those who received a PEG tube during the hospitalization were 2.3 times <strong>more</strong> likely than those who did not receive a PEG tube to develop a new pressure ulcer over the next year, and were less likely to have an existing ulcer heal (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p>In order to facilitate decision-making, proxies should be counseled that eating problems are expected in the final stage of dementia. With that understanding, providers should ascertain from the proxy the main goal of care and present the treatment option that best aligns with that goal. It is the responsibility of all members of the care team to understand any previously expressed wishes of an individual regarding tube feeding through review of advance directives and discussion with surrogate caregivers, and incorporate these wishes into the care plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Decision aids may assist in this process. As an example, in a cluster randomized trial in which 24 North Carolina nursing homes were randomly assigned to use of a decision aid for feeding options or standard care, proxies in the intervention facilities had reduced decisional conflict, increased knowledge, and were more likely to discuss eating problems with providers (46 versus 33 percent, p = 0.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the proportion of nursing home residents with advanced dementia who received a feeding tube within one year of the onset of feeding problems decreased by approximately 50 percent between 2000 (11.7 percent) and 2014 (5.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. While insertion rates fell by a similar proportion in black and white residents, they remained relatively higher among black residents compared with white residents (17.5 versus 3.1 percent in 2014).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423254582\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIONS AND FEVER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections and fever are very common in advanced dementia. They account for approximately one quarter of all treatment decisions and are often terminal events. The respiratory and urinary tracts account for approximately one half and one third of all suspected infections, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The approach to treatment requires judicious consideration of the balance between the palliative care needs of the patient and standard infectious disease practice. </p><p>Antimicrobial use is extensive in advanced dementia, with up to 40 percent of patients receiving antimicrobials in the last few weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Much of this use may be inappropriate, however, as antimicrobials are often started without adequate clinical evidence of an infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>].</p><p>Antimicrobial misuse is a major concern not only from the perspective of individual patient burden, but also from a public health standpoint, due to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Antimicrobial exposure is the greatest risk factor for acquisition of resistance, and colonization rates with multi-drug resistant organisms are three times higher among nursing home residents with advanced dementia compared with other residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In a prospective cohort study, 67 percent of nursing home residents with advanced dementia were colonized with at least one multi-drug resistant organism during a 12-month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Residents had higher acquisition rates if they had received at least one day of exposure to quinolones (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.89, 95% CI 1.28-2.81) or third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins (AHR 1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.40). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-infection-control-in-long-term-care-facilities#H7475987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of infection control in long-term care facilities&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial stewardship'</a>.)</p><p>Other risks of antimicrobial administration of particular concern in frail older adults include drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], Clostridium difficile infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], and the potential discomfort associated with parenteral administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2552473\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and treatment of suspected infections in advanced dementia should be guided by the goals of care. The main treatment choice is whether to administer potentially curative antimicrobials or to institute solely palliative measures (eg, oxygen, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>). </p><p>When antimicrobial use is consistent with the goals of care of a patient and his or her family, the provider should conduct a clinical assessment to be certain there is adequate evidence of an infection to justify such treatment. The minimal clinical criteria to initiate antimicrobials in the nursing home population endorsed by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provide a useful guide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] that has been adapted for use in advanced dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89843 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,74</a>]. In one study, only 44 percent of suspected infectious episodes treated with antimicrobials in nursing home residents with advanced dementia met these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Once the decision to initiate antimicrobials is made, the need for confirmatory tests (eg, chest x-rays, white cell counts, urine specimen by catheterization) should be balanced by the potential burden of obtaining the investigations in these terminally ill patients.</p><p>In the absence of any randomized trials, it remains unclear as to whether antimicrobial therapy for infections in advanced dementia improves survival or symptomatic relief beyond that which can be achieved by high-quality palliative care. Observational data suggest that antimicrobial treatment for pneumonia is associated with better survival but worse comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], whereas antimicrobial treatment for suspected UTI may not impact overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>As an example, in the CASCADE study of over 300 nursing home residents with advanced dementia, there were 225 pneumonia episodes treated with oral antimicrobials (55 percent), intramuscular (IM) antimicrobials (16 percent), intravenous (IV) antimicrobials or hospitalization (20 percent), or no antimicrobials (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The following results were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who received antimicrobials lived an average of 273 days longer than those who did not receive antimicrobials, but survival did not differ among the three antimicrobial routes (adjusted hazard ratios for oral, IM, or IV versus no antimicrobials: 0.2, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residents receiving any form of antimicrobial treatment for pneumonia had worse comfort (lower scores on the Symptom Management at End-of-Life in Dementia scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]) compared with untreated residents. </p><p/><p>These data suggest that even when prolongation of life remains a goal, it may be possible to give antimicrobials orally, if appropriate, and avoid more aggressive parenteral treatment or hospitalization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2552467\"><span class=\"h2\">Suspected urinary tract infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of advanced dementia patients for urinary tract infections (UTIs) warrants specific consideration, as they are particularly challenging to diagnose and the most common reason for antimicrobial misuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In a prospective study of nursing home residents with advanced dementia, 80 percent of suspected UTIs treated with antimicrobials lacked minimal criteria to justify such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis of a UTI requires symptoms, together with positive findings on urinalysis and urine culture. In advanced dementia patients, however, urine specimens are commonly positive in the absence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], and antimicrobial therapy is not warranted for asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/65,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,77</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients without indwelling urinary catheters, who are at a much lower risk of having a UTI than catheterized patients, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) criteria require fever plus another symptom or sign as minimal clinical criteria to start antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In patients with advanced dementia, signs and symptoms of a UTI can be difficult to discern. Since patients are effectively mute, classic symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, costovertebral tenderness, and suprapubic pain are unreliable and rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], and mental status change may be the only observable symptom. It is important to recognize, however, that mental status change alone is not a sensitive or specific symptom of UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In most instances, therefore, both fever and mental status change should be present in order to justify antimicrobial initiation for a suspected UTI in a non-catheterized patient with advanced dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89843 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In patients with an indwelling urinary catheter, fever alone may be adequate evidence for initiation when there are no additional symptoms (eg, new cough) to suggest an alternative source of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89843 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Antimicrobials should be discontinued as soon as the urinalysis and urine culture results are confirmed negative. If the tests results are positive, the provider must still apply clinical judgment to assess whether the combination of signs or symptoms and positive urine tests reflect a true UTI rather than another etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423254589\"><span class=\"h1\">HOSPITALIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalization is common in advanced dementia patients at the end of life and in many cases avoidable. Approximately 16 percent of US decedents dying from dementia die in hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and nursing home residents with advanced dementia experience an average of 1.6 hospital transfers in the last 90 days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. It is estimated that 75 percent of hospitalizations among patients with advanced dementia are avoidable, either because hospital-level care is unnecessary or inconsistent with preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Data suggest that pneumonia, the most common reason precipitating hospitalization in these patients, can be treated with equal efficacy in the nursing home or community, with fewer burdens to the patient and less cost to the health care system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/36,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,79,80</a>].</p><p>Hospitalizations are traumatic and associated with worse end of life outcomes among patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/27,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,73</a>]. Hospitals are also a key site of treatment decisions, although decision-making is often suboptimal due to the discontinuity of care, unfamiliar providers, and pressures for timely discharge. For example, 68 percent of feeding tubes are placed in patients with advanced dementia during a hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p>For the majority of advanced dementia patients for whom comfort is the priority, hospitalization is seldom consistent with this goal, with rare exceptions (eg, hip fracture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/10,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,81</a>]. In most instances, the burdens of hospitalization outweigh the benefits and should be avoided. Providers should routinely counsel proxies and ascertain their preferences for hospitalizing their loved one with advanced dementia prior to the onset of an acute illness. The desire to avoid hospitalization should be formalized as a written advance directive or do-not-hospitalize order.

Clinicians should be prepared to promote compassionate, evidence-based counseling and shared decision-making in order to avoid burdensome care that is of limited clinical benefit and not aligned with preferences. (See <a href=\"#H423254519\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course and prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance care planning is the cornerstone of high-quality palliative care in advance dementia. Patients with dementia and their families should be informed about what to expect at the end stage of the disease. Formal advance directives and an appointment of a health care proxy should be ascertained prior to the end-stage of dementia. (See <a href=\"#H423254540\" class=\"local\">'Decision-making support'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of palliative care in advanced dementia should be guided by a preference for comfort-focused care, not estimated prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H423254526\" class=\"local\">'Prognostication and hospice eligibility'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When available, referral to hospice or specialized palliative care services should be considered in the care plan of patients with advanced dementia. (See <a href=\"#H423254533\" class=\"local\">'US Medicare guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding problems are the most common clinical complication and source of treatment decisions in advanced dementia. Conservative measures that may improve oral intake include altering the texture of food and offering finger foods, smaller portions, favorite foods, and nutritional supplements. When feeding problems persist despite conservative measures, we suggest continued oral feeding by hand rather than tube feeding for nutritional support (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H423254575\" class=\"local\">'Eating problems'</a> above and <a href=\"#H180660962\" class=\"local\">'Oral versus tube feeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent infections are the second most common clinical complication. There is excessive misuse of antimicrobials in advanced dementia. Clinicians should ensure that minimal criteria to suspect an infection are present before initiating testing and treatment, and antimicrobial use should be aligned with patient and family goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H423254582\" class=\"local\">'Infections and fever'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalizations are traumatic for patients with advanced dementia and often unnecessary. Hospital transfers should be avoided unless clearly needed to achieve the desired goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H423254589\" class=\"local\">'Hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic daily medications can be discontinued when they no longer have clear benefits for patients with advanced dementia. (See <a href=\"#H423254619\" class=\"local\">'Continuation of anti-dementia and other chronic medications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hebert LE, Scherr PA, Bienias JL, et al.
