A broad range of manifestations can be seen in <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, including allergic disease, semi-invasive, and invasive disease. Although <em>Aspergillus</em> species are ubiquitous in nature, infection is uncommon, except in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed hosts. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are susceptible to <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, which can lead to disseminated disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of invasive aspergillosis in patients with AIDS.

However, with the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy, aspergillosis can be seen in those with higher CD4 counts as well. As an example, in an analysis of patients enrolled in the French Hospital Database on HIV from 1992 to 2011, 242 HIV-infected patients with invasive aspergillosis were identified; although 174 (72 percent) patients had a CD4 cell count less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> among patients in the cohort diagnosed between 2002 to 2011, almost 50 percent had CD4 cell counts greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Other risk factors for aspergillosis include a prior history of one or more opportunistic infections (eg, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia or cytomegalovirus infection), receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics, alcohol or marijuana use, and underlying lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,9,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,11,13</a>]. The risk of aspergillosis following <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia may be related to two main factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids are routinely used as an adjunctive therapy in moderate to severe infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia can lead to abnormal architecture of the lung, creating an environment for <em>Aspergillus</em> colonization and subsequent invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p>It is important to note that not all AIDS patients have a &quot;classic&quot; risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other immunologic defects associated with HIV infection, such as complement consumption due to high levels of circulating immune complexes, defective macrophage function, and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis, may account for these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

There are over 200 <em>Aspergillus</em> species described, of which at least 50 cause disease in humans. Of these, <em>A. fumigatus</em> is most common and is responsible for the vast majority of infections; in one large case series, <em>A. fumigatus</em> was identified in 95 percent of cases; <em>A. flavus</em>, <em>A. niger</em>, and <em>A. terreus</em> made up the remaining cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].<strong> </strong></p><p>Microscopically, <em>Aspergillus</em> species have septate hyphae, with spherical, thick-walled conidia and smaller microconidia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70889\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70889 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827336\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled conidia reach small airways or alveolar spaces where hyphae may germinate and invade locally into lung tissue and vascular structures. Local invasion into blood vessels results in characteristic findings of aspergillosis, such as thrombosis leading to infarction and necrosis of surrounding tissue. Invasion of this pathogen into vascular structures can also lead to disseminated disease. Central nervous system disease may also occur secondary to local invasion from the sinuses or orbital spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although neutropenia is an important risk factor for invasive aspergillosis, animal and in vitro studies support a key role for alveolar macrophages in the early stages of host defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It has been demonstrated that corticosteroids impair macrophage killing of conidia and enable hyphal escape. However, in a mouse model, alveolar macrophage depletion did not lead to increased susceptibility to an intratracheal challenge with <em>Aspergillus</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-aspergillosis-and-invasive-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, neutrophil depletion prior to infection was associated with severe disease, while induction of neutropenia six hours after infection did not affect outcomes. </p><p>These data suggest that neutrophils are essential in preventing conidial germination early in the disease process. AIDS patients also have well-described defects in neutrophil chemotaxis and binding, and impaired phagocytosis of macrophages, which may account for the association of neutropenia and the risk of aspergillosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20321627\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) accounts for more than 80 percent of cases of <em>Aspergillus</em> infection in HIV-infected patients.
