Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the woman's last period. Going into labor before 37 weeks of pregnancy can be dangerous, because babies who are born preterm can have serious health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918603\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes preterm labor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is often hard to know why a woman has preterm labor. Some things that might cause preterm labor are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding or other problems in the uterus (womb)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being pregnant with twins, triplets, or more babies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection in the uterus or other part of the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918610\"><span class=\"h1\">Who is at risk for preterm labor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is usually not possible to tell who will go into labor early. Black women are more likely to give birth early than white, Latina, or Asian women.</p><p>Women at highest risk of preterm labor (having a baby 3 or more weeks before the due date) are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who had preterm labor and birth in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are pregnant with more than 1 baby (twins, triplets, etc)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women whose &quot;water breaks&quot; before 37 weeks of pregnancy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a short cervical length on ultrasound (the cervix is the bottom part of the uterus that leads to the vagina)</p><p/><p>Other things that might increase the risk of preterm labor are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain infections (including bladder and kidney infections)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being underweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal bleeding during the pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waiting only a short time between pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous surgery on the cervix</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormally shaped uterus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918617\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of preterm labor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of preterm labor are the same as with normal labor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tightening of the uterus, also called &quot;contractions.&quot; These can make the belly feel hard while they are happening. They eventually become painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change in the fluid that comes out of the vagina (it might be watery, thick, or bloody)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the amount of fluid that comes out of the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or pressure low in the belly or in thighs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the low back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps, sometimes with diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Broken water,&quot; which feels like a trickle or gush of fluid from the vagina</p><p/><p>Some women have &quot;Braxton Hicks contractions.&quot; These are contractions that happen several minutes apart. They are usually not too painful and don't get stronger or more frequent over time. They often go away when you lie down or rest. Braxton Hicks contractions are sometimes called &quot;false labor contractions.&quot; That's because they don't really mean that you are going into labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918624\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think you might be in labor, call your doctor, nurse, or midwife. You should also call if you have blood or fluid leaking from your vagina, or if you have more than 6 contractions in 1 hour. (That means that contractions are 10 minutes apart.) It is hard to know if you are actually in labor without being seen by a doctor or nurse.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will be able to tell if you are in labor by examining your cervix and checking to see how often your contractions are happening. There are also tests your doctor or nurse can do to find out what is going on. It might take an hour or 2 to figure out whether you are in preterm labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918631\"><span class=\"h1\">Does preterm labor mean that my baby will be born early?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not always. Some women who have preterm labor end up having their baby at the normal time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918638\"><span class=\"h1\">How is preterm labor treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different treatments for preterm labor. The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is causing your labor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far along you are in your pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How healthy you and your baby are</p><p/><p>Your doctor might give you medicine to try to stop or slow down your labor. These medicines are called &quot;tocolytic drugs.&quot; Your doctor might also give you medicines called steroids, especially if you are less than 34 weeks pregnant. These medicines will speed up the growth of your baby's lungs. This will help the baby to breathe if he or she is born early. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.) If you are less than 32 weeks pregnant, the doctor might give you a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">magnesium sulfate</a> to help prevent a brain disorder that could affect the baby called cerebral palsy.</p><p>Medicines used to stop preterm labor do not always work. If you do end up giving birth early, your health care team can take steps to protect the health of the baby.</p><p>Sometimes, the doctor or nurse will decide that it is better for the baby to be born early than to try to stop the labor. What is right for you will depend on your individual situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918645\"><span class=\"h1\">Can preterm labor be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no way to prevent preterm labor most of the time. If you had a preterm birth before, your doctor might give you a hormone (called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">progesterone</a>&quot;) to decrease the chance of it happening again. It is important to pay attention to how you are feeling during pregnancy. Call your doctor or nurse right away if you think you might be in labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196918652\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-premature-rupture-of-membranes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Miscarriage (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=having-twins-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Having twins (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
