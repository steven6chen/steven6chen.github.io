Most febrile illnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite thorough evaluation.</p><p>An approach to the evaluation of FUO in children will be reviewed here. Causes of FUO in children, fever without a source, and fever in specific pediatric populations are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Febrile infant (younger than 90 days of age): Outpatient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Febrile infant (younger than 90 days of age): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of fever in children with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-hiv-infected-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in HIV-infected children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consensus definition for FUO in children is lacking. For clinical purposes, we define FUO in children as fever &gt;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F) at least once per day for &ge;8 days with no apparent diagnosis after initial outpatient or hospital evaluation that includes a detailed history, thorough physical examination, and initial laboratory assessment.</p><p>Various definitions for FUO have been used in published studies of FUO in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]. The required duration of fever for inclusion in case series has ranged from five days to three weeks. Some series used different durations depending upon the setting (inpatient versus outpatient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/2,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11</a>].

Our definition is notably different from the standard definition of FUO for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with fever of unknown origin&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p>FUO must be differentiated from fever without a source (FWS), which we define as fever for &le;1 week without adequate explanation after a thorough history and physical examination; FWS can progress to FUO if it lasts &gt;1 week. The differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management of FUO and FWS differ. FWS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-outpatient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Febrile infant (younger than 90 days of age): Outpatient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a>.)</p><p>FUO also must be differentiated from &quot;pseudoFUO&quot; or sequential febrile illnesses (usually viral), the first of which may be associated with a higher than normal fever and vague persistent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498159097\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the lack of a consensus definition, the incidence of FUO in children is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many infectious and noninfectious diseases can cause FUO in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69379 \">table 1</a>).

Neoplastic disorders are less common and usually have manifestations other than fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/2-9,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9,14-16</a>].

With advances in diagnostic testing (eg, molecular assays) and increased awareness of certain conditions, children with diseases previously common in FUO case series are now diagnosed earlier in their course of illness (eg, infectious diseases, neoplastic disorders, rheumatologic diseases, periodic fever syndromes, etc), leaving increasing numbers of children with difficult-to-diagnose conditions in FUO series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/15,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78876239\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of FUO usually begins in the outpatient setting.

Patients with chronic medical conditions generally have been excluded from case series of FUO.</p><p>The pace can be more deliberate if the child appears well.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fever history'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial evaluation includes a detailed history, physical examination, basic diagnostic tests for all patients, and additional testing targeted to clinical findings in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/11,13,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,19-21</a>].</p><p>A detailed and thorough history and physical examination are the most important components of the diagnostic evaluation. In case series of FUO, incomplete histories, overlooked physical findings, and failure to correctly interpret existing laboratory data delayed determination of the underlying cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The clinician must be prepared to repeat the clinical assessment on multiple occasions to reassess historical features or clinical findings that may have been missed previously. It may help to rephrase important questions. A patient or parent eventually may recall information that was omitted, forgotten, or thought to be unimportant when the initial history was obtained. New physical findings can appear, and subtle abnormalities not appreciated on the initial evaluation can become more apparent. In a retrospective series of 54 children with FUO, more than 25 percent developed clinically relevant physical findings after admission to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1252008701\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history in a child with FUO should include questions related to common disorders (often with an unusual presentation) as well as uncommon diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111286\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111286 \">table 3</a>). Virtually any historical finding may be relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential to obtain as much detail about the fever as possible.
