The most commonly affected adults are poorly controlled diabetics with peripheral neuropathy and vascular insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

If the areas of necrotic bone separate from the remaining viable bone, sequestra are formed. Surviving bone and periosteum ultimately produce a sheath of bone surrounding the area of necrosis, which is referred to as an involucrum. Both the sequestra and involucrum may be apparent radiographically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107686\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107686 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107687\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107687 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Acute osteomyelitis refers to infection in the bone prior to development of sequestra, usually measured in days or weeks. In some forms of osteomyelitis, development of sequestra is relatively slow (such as vertebral osteomyelitis), while in others the development of sequestra occurs relatively rapidly (such as osteomyelitis in the setting of prosthetic devices or compound fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Following formation of sequestra, the infection is considered to be chronic osteomyelitis. Other hallmarks of chronic osteomyelitis include involucrum, local bone loss, and sinus tracts (extension of infection through cortical bone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107686\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107686 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107687\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107687 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855831289\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTING AN IMAGING MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of suspected osteomyelitis includes radiographic imaging interpreted together with the clinical history, culture data, and laboratory results. The optimal imaging modality depends upon the specific clinical circumstances and should be tailored accordingly. An integrated diagnostic approach for osteomyelitis is outlined in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults#H9469335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.)</p><p>In general, if osteomyelitis is suspected based on clinical history and physical findings, imaging should begin with conventional radiographs (plain radiographs) of the involved area for patients with at least two weeks of clinical symptoms. A more sophisticated imaging modality should be pursued for patients with less than two weeks of symptoms, normal radiographs, or radiographs suggestive of osteomyelitis without definitive characteristic features. In general, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality with greatest sensitivity for diagnosis of osteomyelitis; if MRI is not available, computed tomography (CT) is an appropriate alternative test. If metal hardware precludes MRI or CT, a nuclear study is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4193089710\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity of conventional radiographs for detection of acute osteomyelitis is limited, and the specificity of some imaging modalities may be limited by confounding bony pathology.

Conventional radiographs are useful for identification of noninfectious pathology and for identifying air within soft tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82657\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82657 \">image 3</a>). The sensitivity of conventional radiographs range from 22 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One meta-analysis including diabetic foot ulcers reported a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.54 and 0.68, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Radiographic findings of osteomyelitis include osteopenia, cortical loss, bony destruction, and periosteal reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Following trauma, radiographic findings of architectural distortion, osteopenia due to disuse, and normal fracture healing may be difficult to distinguish from osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, conventional radiography may be insufficient to distinguish osteomyelitis from other processes such as Charcot arthropathy and fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the presence of orthopedic hardware, findings of osteomyelitis may include fracture nonunion or periprosthetic lucency. In the setting of chronic osteomyelitis, reactive sclerosis, sequestra, and involucrum may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546496153\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is the imaging modality with greatest sensitivity for diagnosis of osteomyelitis. It is useful for obtaining images delineating the extent of cortical destruction characteristic of osteomyelitis, as well as to evaluate for presence of bone marrow and soft tissue inflammation (such as in the setting of cellulitis, myositis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulceration) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80488\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80488 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. MRI may demonstrate abnormal marrow edema as early as three to five days following onset of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. Intravenous contrast does not improve the detection of osteomyelitis on MRI but does improve the distinction between phlegmons, necrotic tissue, and abscesses.</p><p>MRI has high sensitivity and negative predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1,5,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,15-18</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the sensitivity of MRI was superior to conventional radiography and nuclear modalities (including bone scans and white blood cell studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another meta-analysis including patients with diabetic foot ulceration who underwent MRI reported a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.79, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57504\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57504 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Given the high negative predictive value of MRI, a study with no evidence of osteomyelitis is sufficient for exclusion of osteomyelitis if clinical signs or symptoms have been present for at least one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Both T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted (or STIR) images should be obtained; these are usually performed in the same imaging plane. Abnormal osseous signal on all sequences in the region of concern in the correct clinical setting confirms the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Soft tissue abnormalities adjacent to the bone and bony destruction increase diagnostic confidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>MRI may overestimate the extent and duration of infection, given its high sensitivity. Reactive marrow edema may coexist with true marrow infection, leading to an imaging abnormality that is larger than the area of actual infection. In addition, bone marrow changes may persist for weeks to months after osteomyelitis begins to respond to therapy.</p><p>Bone marrow signal abnormality on MRI is a nonspecific finding that can be seen with a variety of other pathologies including contusion, fracture, postsurgical change, arthritis, neoplasm, and Charcot arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Establishing the correct diagnosis depends on the clinical setting and on additional imaging findings. Moreover, if infection coexists with additional pathology that can cause bone marrow edema, MRI cannot reliably distinguish between marrow changes attributable to infection and those attributable to other pathology.</p><p>It may be diagnostically challenging to distinguish diabetic foot with Charcot arthropathy from concomitant infection on MRI. The presence of sinus tracts, fluid collections with thick rim or diffuse enhancement and extensive adjacent marrow abnormality are concerning for Charcot with superimposed osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In cases of severe Charcot arthropathy, definitive radiographic exclusion of osteomyelitis may not be possible.</p><p>MRI is the imaging modality of choice for delineating the anatomy of the spinal cord and adjacent osseous and soft tissues. In vertebral osteomyelitis, findings on T1-weighted images include decreased signal intensity in the disk and adjacent vertebral bodies and loss of endplate definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Findings on T2-weighted images include increased signal intensity in the disk and adjacent vertebral bodies. Following intravenous administration of gadolinium, there is enhancement of the disk, adjacent vertebral bodies, and involved paraspinal and epidural soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Very early vertebral osteomyelitis can mimic degenerative changes. If the initial MRI is negative for infection but clinical suspicion for infection remains high, repeat MRI after one to two weeks is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gadolinium contrast-enhanced images are not required to diagnose acute osteomyelitis. However, administration of contrast is useful to enhance visualization of sinus tracts, fistulas, and necrotic tissue and to distinguish between abscess and phlegmon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80488\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80488 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Metallic hardware can give rise to artifact that may degrade MRI image quality and limit diagnostic capability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H610397737\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than conventional radiography for assessing cortical and trabecular integrity, periosteal reaction, intraosseous gas, soft tissue gas, and the extent of sinus tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78389\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78389 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/8,10,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,24-27</a>]. It is the most useful modality to evaluate for the presence of osseous sequestra and involucrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Intravenous contrast is required for detection of soft tissue abnormalities such as sinus tracts.

Nuclear imaging has high sensitivity for detecting evidence of inflammation and therefore tends to be more reliable for evaluation of acute infection than chronic infection. There are a number of different nuclear study modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, three-phase bone scans, and tagged white blood cell (WBC) scans; gallium scans are used less often.</p><p>A major limitation of nuclear studies is that radiographic evidence of bone turnover or inflammation due to noninfectious bone pathology may be confused with osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Such conditions include recent trauma or surgery, recently healed osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, bone tumors, and Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. False-negative results are possible in areas of relative ischemia (a common comorbidity in osteomyelitis) since radiotracer may not be adequately delivered to the target site.</p><p>Flourine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) imaging using PET is a relatively new modality that has shown promising results for imaging of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/18,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,34-37</a>] and may overcome some of the limitations with other nuclear imaging studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography <strong>&ndash;</strong> Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) uses 18F-FDG, a glucose analog that accumulates in leukocytes, which in turn accumulate at the site of infection. The 18F-FDG molecule accumulates rapidly even in poorly perfused areas due to its small size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The tracer provides high-resolution tomographic images and, when combined with CT (18F-FDG PET CT), provides the anatomic detail of conventional CT scans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preliminary data suggest that 18F-FDG PET is useful for assessing both acute and chronic osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/17,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,38</a>]. A meta-analysis including 299 patients from nine studies reported a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 74 and 91 percent, respectively. Preliminary data also suggest 18F-FDG PET may be useful in distinguishing Charcot arthropathy from normal joints and patients with osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Small studies have also suggested that 18F-FDG PET is useful in diagnosing spondylitis, with 18F-FDG PET performing as well as or better than MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">18F-FDG PET has several disadvantages; these include the inability to discriminate tumor from infection, high cost, and limited availability. Tissue inflammation associated with spinal hardware and spinal degenerative changes may be confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. 18F-FDG PET may be useful as an alternative to MRI for circumstances in which MRI is contraindicated or as a supplement when MRI is equivocal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three-phase bone scan &ndash; Three-phase bone scans use a radionuclide tracer that accumulates in areas of bone turnover and increased osteoblast activity (such as technetium-99m bound to a phosphorus-containing compound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The scans are performed using a gamma camera at three points following tracer injection: immediately after injection (blood flow phase), 15 minutes after injection (blood pool phase), and four hours after injection (osseous phase). In the setting of osteomyelitis, there is intense uptake in all three phases; in the setting of cellulitis, there is increased activity only in the first two phases and normal or mild diffuse increased activity in the third phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sensitivity and specificity of three-phase bone scan for detection of osteomyelitis varies depending on the appearance of correlative radiographs. If conventional radiographs are normal, three-phase bone scan has a sensitivity and specificity of about 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1,32,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32,41</a>]. If radiographs demonstrate noninfectious disorders such as fracture or Charcot arthropathy, (entities associated with bone formation and radionuclide tracer uptake), false-positive results are more likely. False-negative results are possible in early osteomyelitis or in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis with impaired blood flow or infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for three-phase bone scans were 0.81 and 0.28, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tagged white blood cell scan &ndash; A tagged WBC scan uses autologous WBCs labeled with indium 111 oxyquinoline, gallium-67, or technetium-99m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. To perform the study, blood is drawn from the patient, and the white blood cells are separated for labeling with tracer; after a few hours, the tagged white cells are returned to the patient's circulation via intravenous injection. Images are taken up to 24 hours later. The tagged white cells accumulate in the bone marrow and at sites of inflammation or infection; they are not specific for bone. The different tagging agents result in different advantages and disadvantages for the agent used. For example, indium 111-labeled WBCs are more stable than those tagged with technetium 99m, but the scans are of much lower resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tagged WBC scans have similar sensitivity to bone scans for evaluation of osteomyelitis, but the specificity can be poor if corresponding radiographs are not normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Reported sensitivities and specificities range from 72 to 100 percent and 67 to 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, regions with substantial quantities of red marrow (such as the vertebral bodies) are not visualized reliably with this modality; WBC scans may best be used in the distal extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Tagged WBC scans can be falsely positive in the setting of other causes of inflammation including fracture and Charcot arthropathy. False-negative results are possible in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis when white cell migration to sites of infection is decreased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallium and dual tracer scans &ndash; Gallium scans utilize the affinity of gallium-67 to acute phase reactants (lactoferrin, transferrin, and others) to demonstrate areas of inflammation that may be related to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This older modality is used less commonly than the other nuclear modalities described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This method is quite sensitive and more specific than three-phase bone scan (sensitivity and specificity 25 to 80 and 67 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

False-positive results can occur in the setting of uptake related to fracture and neoplasm; correlative radiographs may help to evaluate for these entities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Scanning is typically performed 24 hours following gallium injection and therefore should be reserved for patients who are clinically stable and do not require prompt imaging results for urgent management decisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A gallium scan can be performed concurrently with a technetium-labeled three-phase bone scan, and the information gathered may be more useful than that obtained from either examination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In this instance, both radionuclide species are injected at the same time.

This tool allows improved distinction between soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis as well as improved localization of osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7258185\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound may be a useful diagnostic tool for circumstances in which other modalities are not readily available. Typically, bone is not well depicted by ultrasound, because the cortical surface of the bone reflects the acoustic energy that is used to generate ultrasound images. However, changes superficial to cortical bone can be visualized by ultrasound.</p><p>In osteomyelitis, ultrasound can demonstrate elevation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thickening of the periosteum due to pus emanating from the bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Ultrasound may be more useful for detection of these findings in pediatric patients, since the periosteum in the pediatric skeleton is more loosely adherent to the cortex than in the adult skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ultrasonography is excellent for aspirating suspected infected fluid collections or abscesses, and is useful in providing guidance for needle biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

A more sophisticated imaging modality should be pursued for patients with less than two weeks of symptoms, normal radiographs, or radiographs suggestive of osteomyelitis without definitive characteristic features. In general, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality with greatest sensitivity for diagnosis of osteomyelitis; if MRI is not available, computed tomography (CT) is an appropriate alternative test. If metal hardware precludes MRI or CT, a nuclear study is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2855831289\" class=\"local\">'Selecting an imaging modality'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults#H9469335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of osteomyelitis, inflammatory exudate in the marrow causes elevated medullary pressure, which compresses vascular channels, leading to ischemia and bone necrosis. If the areas of necrotic bone separate from the remaining viable bone, sequestra are formed. Surviving bone and periosteum ultimately produce a sheath of bone surrounding the area of necrosis, which is referred to as an involucrum. Both the sequestra and involucrum may be apparent radiographically. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings of osteomyelitis on conventional radiography include osteopenia, cortical loss, bony destruction, and periosteal reaction. Other chronic findings include reactive sclerosis, sequestra, and involucrum. Conventional radiographs are useful for identification of noninfectious pathology and for identifying air within soft tissues. However, conventional radiography may be insufficient to distinguish osteomyelitis from other processes such as Charcot arthropathy and fracture. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Conventional radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for diagnosis of osteomyelitis. MRI may demonstrate abnormal marrow edema as early as three to five days following onset of infection, and an MRI with no evidence of osteomyelitis is sufficient for exclusion of osteomyelitis in patients with symptoms for at least one week. MRI is useful for delineating the extent of cortical destruction characteristic of osteomyelitis, as well as for detecting presence of bone marrow and soft tissue inflammation (such as in the setting of cellulitis, myositis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulceration). However, MRI may overestimate the extent and duration of infection and cannot reliably distinguish between marrow changes attributable to infection and those attributable to other pathology. (See <a href=\"#H546496153\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography is more sensitive than conventional radiography for assessing cortical and trabecular integrity, periosteal reaction, intraosseous gas, soft tissue gas, and the extent of sinus tracts. It is the most useful modality to evaluate for the presence of osseous sequestra and involucrum. (See <a href=\"#H610397737\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nuclear study may be useful if metal hardware precludes MRI or CT. Nuclear imaging has high sensitivity for detecting evidence of inflammation and therefore tends to be more reliable for evaluation of acute infection than chronic infection. However, a major limitation of nuclear studies is that radiographic evidence of bone turnover or inflammation due to noninfectious bone pathology may be confused with osteomyelitis. Positron emission tomography has shown promising results for imaging of infection and may overcome some of the limitations with other nuclear imaging studies. Single photon emission computed tomography improves the accuracy of tracer imaging alone. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nuclear modalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound may be a useful diagnostic tool in circumstances where the more preferred modalities are not readily available. In addition, ultrasound is excellent for aspirating suspected infected fluid collections or abscesses.
