Patients progress to symptomatic myeloma or AL amyloidosis at an approximate rate of 10 percent per year for the first five years, 3 percent per year for the next five years, and 1 to 2 percent per year for the following 10 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F98065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98065 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As such, the majority of patients with SMM will progress with a median time to progression of 4.8 years. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85866073\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical and genetic risk factors for progression have been identified and can be used to identify high risk disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109720 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Factors associated with an increased risk of progression include an abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio (&lt;0.125 or &gt;8.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], bone marrow plasma cells &ge;10 percent, and a serum M protein &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. These three risk factors were found to have significant prognostic value in a large retrospective study of patients with SMM from the Mayo Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The probability of progression at five years was 25, 51, and 76 percent for patients who had one, two, or three of these risk factors, respectively.</p><p>Additional risk factors for progression include IgA isotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], immunoparesis with reduction of two uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>], abnormal plasma cell immunophenotype in the setting of immunoparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], increased circulating plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the detection of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In addition, genetic features may impact prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109721 \">table 4</a>). In one study, time to progression and overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with t(4;14) when compared with those with t(11;14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A trend towards shorter time to progression has also been seen in patients with deletion 17p, gain 1q21, and hyperdiploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>The impact of genetic changes on prognosis appears to be strongest in patients with a low tumor burden. In a prospective study of 179 patients with SMM, those with a high risk gene expression profile signature had a higher rate of progression to symptomatic myeloma at two years (51 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The impact of these and other genetic findings on clinical outcomes must be validated and compared with clinical features before they can be routinely applied to clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55635621\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike patients with multiple myeloma (MM), patients with SMM do not have any evidence of end-organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell disorder. SMM needs to be differentiated from MM because patients with SMM do not require immediate treatment. As with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), patients with SMM can be misdiagnosed as having MM, and there is absence of clear benefit with currently available therapies, and some patients with SMM can remain stable without treatment over extended periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>].</p><p>If there are doubts about the differentiation of <span class=\"nowrap\">MGUS/SMM</span> from myeloma, and whether to begin chemotherapy immediately, one should withhold treatment and reevaluate in two or three months.</p><p>The general approach to management needs to consider whether patients with SMM have one or more high risk factors (high risk SMM) or not (low risk SMM). Observation alone is appropriate for low risk SMM, while in high risk SMM, clinical trials investigating strategies to prevent progression should be considered. In addition, selected high risk patients with multiple risk factors and evidence of rising M protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free light chain (FLC) level may be considered for therapy as discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109720 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55635627\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with SMM, we recommend close follow-up with deferral of chemotherapy until progression to symptomatic disease. A clearly increasing level of the M-protein in the serum or urine suggests that therapy will be needed in the near future. Patients with SMM can be misdiagnosed as having MM, and there is absence of clear benefit with currently available therapies, and some patients with SMM can remain stable without treatment over extended periods of time. Details on the prognostic value of end-organ damage are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Smoldering multiple myeloma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognostic studies in multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This decision to delay therapy in patients with SMM is supported by a 2003 Cochrane meta-analysis that compared chemotherapy at diagnosis versus deferral of chemotherapy until progression in 262 SMM patients enrolled in three randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While early treatment delayed progression of the disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.29), there were no significant effects on mortality or response rate, and early treatment may increase the risk of acute leukemia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 0.55-18.73).</p><p>Our approach to follow-up is similar to that suggested by the International Myeloma Working Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,26</a>]. At the time of diagnosis, we perform the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies should include a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), complete blood count (CBC), serum creatinine, serum calcium, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) with immunofixation, FLC ratio, and bone marrow biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging should include a skeletal survey plus one of the following imaging modalities: low-dose whole-body computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT,</span> and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole body or spine and pelvis. CT and MRI are equally sensitive and the choice of test depends upon availability. </p><p/><p>Two to three months after this testing, we again measure the SPEP, CBC, creatinine, calcium, FLC ratio, UPEP, and urine immunofixation. If the results of these tests are stable, the span of time between testing can be lengthened to every four to six months for one year, then to every 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Smoldering multiple myeloma'</a>.)</p><p>Follow-up imaging studies must balance the potential cost and toxicity with the risk of progression. For most patients with SMM, we perform annual metastatic bone survey to monitor for the development of asymptomatic bone lesions. A repeat MRI should be performed three to six months after diagnosis in patients with a higher risk of bone progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. This includes patients with diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow on initial MRI, those with a solitary focal lesion, those with equivocal findings on initial imaging, and those with one or more other high risk factors. In patients with otherwise asymptomatic myeloma, the identification of more than one focal bone lesion on MRI is diagnostic of MM and an indication for therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55638741\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SMM are at increased risk of fracture and thromboembolic disease. Patients with SMM should be evaluated for osteoporosis with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and have their vitamin D and calcium intake optimized. If osteoporosis is present, treatment with bisphosphonates may be considered at the same dosing and schedule used for osteoporosis in patients without SMM. Persons with MGUS or MM also have a higher incidence of developing second cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/smoldering-multiple-myeloma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. We recommend that patients with SMM be encouraged to participate in age-appropriate cancer screening programs. No additional cancer screening has been recommended for this population.

Patients with high risk SMM need close observation with evaluation for progression every three to four months. If these patients had baseline abnormalities on MRI (diffuse infiltration, solitary focal lesion, or equivocal lesions), follow-up MRI examinations in three to six months are recommended. Patients with high risk SMM are candidates for clinical trials testing preventive strategies. In addition, patients with high risk SMM with multiple risk factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of biologic progression (rising M protein or FLC level) can be considered for therapy. There are no specific factors to make this determination, and clinical judgment is needed. </p><p>Treatment options for patients with symptomatic MM are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A subgroup of patients with SMM has a high rate of progression to symptomatic myeloma and may benefit from therapy prior to the development of symptoms.

The following findings, if attributable to the underlying plasma cell disorder, are diagnostic of MM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57627 \">table 1</a>): anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, lytic bone lesions or severe osteopenia, and extramedullary plasmacytoma. In addition, the following are diagnostic biomarkers of MM in the absence of symptoms: &ge;60 percent clonal plasma cells in the marrow; <span class=\"nowrap\">involved/uninvolved</span> FLC ratio of 100 or more; or more than one focal bone lesion on MRI.
