Now tuberculosis accounts for only 7 to 20 percent of cases; autoimmune disease is responsible for 70 to 90 percent, with the remainder being caused by other infectious diseases, replacement by metastatic cancer or lymphoma, adrenal hemorrhage or infarction, or drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52048 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Disseminated tuberculous or fungal infections are still a major cause of adrenal insufficiency in populations with a high prevalence of these diseases, but as tuberculosis has been better controlled, the overall incidence of Addison's disease has decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence of Addison's disease in Western countries has been estimated at 35 to 60 per million, but three studies indicate it may be as high as 144 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the major causes of primary adrenal insufficiency. Rarer causes are discussed separately. The rarer diseases, such as adrenal <span class=\"nowrap\">leukodystrophy/adrenal</span> myeloneuropathy, are mostly inherited disorders that present in infancy or childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOIMMUNE ADRENALITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1925578\"><span class=\"h2\">Destruction of adrenal cortex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>What long was termed &quot;idiopathic&quot; primary adrenal insufficiency is the result of an autoimmune process that destroys the adrenal cortex. There is evidence of both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms directed at the adrenal cortex, often associated with autoimmune destruction of other endocrine glands (referred to as polyglandular autoimmune syndromes). Antibodies that react with several steroidogenic enzymes (most often 21-hydroxylase) and all three zones of the adrenal cortex are present in the serum of up to 86 percent of patients with autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency (anti-21-hydroxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]), but only rarely in patients with other causes of adrenal insufficiency, or in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, up to 10 percent of first-degree relatives of patients with autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency express these antibodies and have an increased risk of developing adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1925571\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency as part of one of the polyglandular autoimmune syndromes are predominately female (70 percent). In contrast, patients with isolated autoimmune adrenal insufficiency are predominately male (71 percent) during the first two decades of life, are equally male and female in the third decade, and are predominately female (81 percent) thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The explanation for these sex differences is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1925564\"><span class=\"h2\">Early findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first evidence of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency is usually an increase in plasma renin activity in association with a normal or low serum aldosterone concentration, suggesting that the zona glomerulosa is involved initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Several months to years later, zona fasciculata dysfunction becomes evident, first by a decreasing serum cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, later by increased basal serum ACTH concentrations, and finally by decreasing basal serum cortisol concentrations and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].</p><p>One study suggests that a rise in serum ACTH is the best predictor of the subsequent development of adrenal insufficiency in patients with 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies. This was illustrated in a report of 87 such individuals (excluding polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1 patients), who were followed during the two years preceding the onset of adrenal insufficiency. Seven developed adrenal insufficiency while 80 did not. When compared to nonprogressors, those who progressed to adrenal insufficiency were more likely to have an elevated serum ACTH, but there were no differences in plasma renin activity, or peak cortisol response to exogenous ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1925585\"><span class=\"h2\">Other endocrine disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 to 65 percent of patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency have one or more other autoimmune endocrine disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69574 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/2,3,9,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9,16-19</a>]. On the other hand, patients with the more common autoimmune endocrine disorders, such as type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, or Graves' disease, rarely develop adrenal insufficiency. In one report, as an example, 11 of 629 patients (1.7 percent) with type 1 diabetes but none of 239 normal subjects had antibodies directed against 21-hydroxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Three of the eight patients with anti-21-hydroxylaseantibodies had adrenal insufficiency. In another study, only 1 of 114 children with type 1 diabetes and none of 35 children with autoimmune thyroiditis tested positive for anti-adrenal antibodies measured by immunofluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In contrast, about 80 percent of patients with diabetes mellitus associated with the DQ8 HLA allele who also have the DRB*0404 HLA allele and autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase develop adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In another report of 38 patients with type 1 diabetes who also had antibodies directed against 21-hydroxylase, those who were homozygous for MICA5.1 (an MHC class I-related molecule located between tumor necrosis factor-alpha and HLA-B) were at higher risk for developing adrenal insufficiency than those without homozygosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Adrenal insufficiency is easily diagnosed and treated and is potentially lethal if unrecognized; this has led some investigators to recommend screening for this disorder in all patients with type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, we do not believe that testing this large patient population is warranted, given the approximately 1 percent prevalence of subnormal responses to ACTH in these patients.</p><p>Patients with celiac disease had an 11-fold increased risk for adrenal insufficiency in a Swedish study, and 6 of 76 patients with adrenal insufficiency had celiac disease in a Norwegian study, suggesting that patients with either disorder should be evaluated for the other as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The combination of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency with other autoimmune endocrine disorders is referred to as the polyglandular autoimmune syndromes types 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].
