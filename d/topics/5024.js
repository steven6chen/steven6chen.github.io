The behavior and development of children with an incarcerated parent may be influenced by stressors that occur before, during, and after sentencing of the parent. Pediatric providers have a unique opportunity to identify and support children and families affected by a parent's incarceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a Department of Justice report from the year 2007, 2.3 percent of children in the United States (nearly 1.7 million children) had a parent incarcerated in state or federal prison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, at least 1 in 50 children had a parent incarcerated in local or county facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Between 1995 and 2004, the inmate population grew by an average of 3.5 percent annually to approximately 2.1 million prisoners, corresponding to an incarceration rate of 726 per 100,000 residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Because a majority of prisoners (52 percent of state and 63 percent of federal prisoners) are parents, growth in the incarcerated population has been reflected in increasing numbers of affected children, an increase of 80 percent between 1991 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children&rsquo;s Health, 6.9 percent of children had experienced the incarceration of a custodial parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal data regarding the numbers of children affected by parental incarceration are limited. Despite the magnitude of this issue, there is no centralized system for tracking children whose parents become involved with the criminal justice system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. National estimates are gathered through periodic Department of Justice surveys. These interview-based surveys use discrete jail or <span class=\"nowrap\">federal/state</span> inmate samples and do not generate total population estimates for all levels of system involvement. Survey statistics rely solely on inmate report and may underestimate the number of affected children for several reasons, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inmate misinterpretation of questions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonreport of biologically unrelated dependents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concern about disclosure-related child support requirements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE INCARCERATION PROCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand the potential effects of a parent's incarceration, the pediatric provider first must have some understanding of what it means to be incarcerated. The cycle of arrest, incarceration, and re-entry has been conceptualized as a &quot;series of crises&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], each uniquely stressing affected children and families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrest and sentencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents are arrested and taken into custody by officers. For young children living with the offender, this may mean witnessing the parent being arrested and taken away. One study found that one in five children, most younger than seven years old, witnessed the arrest of their mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After arrest, the parent is detained awaiting trial or released on bail. This is followed by a plea or trial and sentencing. Throughout these events, families often face a great deal of uncertainty and financial stress, both from court-related costs and loss of income contribution by the affected parent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Confinement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After sentencing, the parent serves his or her term. Sentences are served in two main types of institutions, depending on the crime and jurisdiction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Jail&quot; is used to refer to a local or county facility, where inmates typically serve shorter sentences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Jails also may be holding facilities for inmates awaiting transfer to state or federal institutions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Prison&quot; typically refers to a state or federal facility, where many inmates serve longer sentences. Prisons are additionally classified as minimum, medium, and maximum security. Prisons often are located at a significant distance from the communities where offenders and their families live [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Most institutions allow some form of visitation, though programs vary widely, from brief no-contact visits to rarer child-friendly programs that aim to support the parent-child relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Release and parole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not always recognized as such, release and re-entry can be a stressful transition for children and families. Pre-existing mental health and substance abuse problems, ineffective parenting styles, and maladaptive family dynamics are infrequently addressed during incarceration and resurface when the released parent attempts to resume family life. Parents incarcerated for a significant time may not recognize their child has grown or changed, or that relationships may have reconstituted in ways that do not actively involve the inmate. Finally, because a majority of inmates are repeat offenders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], there is the ever-present specter of subsequent incarceration, which may further disrupt <span class=\"nowrap\">parent-child/family</span> relationships.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROFILE OF INCARCERATED PARENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the incarcerated parents in the United States have been charged with nonviolent offenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. Several populations are disproportionately affected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority (92 percent) of incarcerated parents are fathers. However, maternal incarceration is growing more rapidly than paternal incarceration (122 percent versus 76 percent increase in maternal and paternal incarceration, respectively, between 1991 and 2007).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most prisoners are younger than 44 years and of child-rearing age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost 60 percent of incarcerated parents are racial and ethnic minorities, with African-American fathers accounting for the largest percentage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Incarceration is frequently a marker of social vulnerability. This is reflected in the personal histories of incarcerated parents, many of whom experienced well-recognized childhood risk factors for adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Approximately one-half of inmate parents did not complete high school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. In addition, in a national survey of inmates from 2002, the following findings were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one-half grew up in single-parent or kinship households</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twelve percent had childhood involvement with the foster care system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-third had a parent or guardian who abused alcohol or drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-half had an immediate family member, parent, or sibling, who had been incarcerated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost one-third of female and more than 10 percent of male inmates reported having been physically or sexually abused before age 18</p><p/><p>This childhood risk profile carries over into adulthood. Inmates have high rates of substance <span class=\"nowrap\">use/abuse</span> (70 to 90 percent in most samples), mental health issues, and domestic and community violence exposure. Nationally, one-quarter of inmates are incarcerated on drug-related charges, and approximately one-third reported being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, respectively, at the time of their offense. Many do not receive substance abuse or mental health treatment while incarcerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF AFFECTED CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like their incarcerated parents, affected children are a vulnerable population. These children often have multiple risks for poor developmental outcome, which are related to their parent and household profiles.</p><p>Data from the United States Department of Justice provide the following characteristics of children of incarcerated parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-half of affected children are younger than nine years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> backgrounds parallel those of the inmate population, with African-American children 7.5 times more likely and Hispanic children 2.5 times more likely to have an incarcerated parent than white children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-half of parents in state or federal prison lived with their children before incarceration. This proportion is significantly higher for parents in local or county jails or when the mother is incarcerated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF PARENTAL INCARCERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research on the effects of parental incarceration has been hampered by several constraints. In addition to difficulties with sample ascertainment and follow-up, most studies do not differentiate between problems existing before the parent's incarceration and those developing as a result of incarceration. Children with incarcerated parents often have multiple risk factors for behavior and developmental problems, including poverty, parental substance use and mental illness, domestic violence, and inconsistent or unavailable caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Sorting out the relative effect of each risk factor is a challenge that is only beginning to be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beyond co-occurring risks, there are several ways in which parental incarceration can uniquely affect developmental outcome. These mechanisms include <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/trauma,</span> attachment disruption, stigma, and modeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Children affected by parental incarceration experience loss on multiple levels. The most obvious is the trauma of the arrest and immediate separation. Witnessing their parent's arrest may be particularly traumatic for toddlers and preschoolers who have age-related attachment needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Older children may come home to find their parent, sometimes their sole or primary caregiver, is gone.</p><p>When a parent is incarcerated, it is left to the remaining caregiver or relative to decide what to tell the child to explain the parent's absence. This may result in what has been called a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] surrounding the parent's circumstance and reasons for absence. Because of worry about stigma and the idea that children should be protected from knowing their parent is incarcerated, children often are not told about the incarceration or are given other reasons for the parent's absence.</p><p>Inaccurate explanations for an incarcerated parent's absence include being told that the parent is at school, work, or traveling. Such explanations may make children feel that the parent has chosen to be away. These explanations also may be confusing if the child has deduced or overheard the truth, in which case the child may lose trust in his or her remaining caregivers.</p><p>Having a parent missing from a child's life is a profound loss. This is particularly important for young children with incarcerated mothers, as they are at increased risk for developing a pattern of insecure caregiver attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term consequences</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Socioeconomic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most obvious impact of parental incarceration on a child and family is socioeconomic. Children of inmates often live and likely will grow up in impoverished households. Over one-half of inmates report having provided primary financial support for their children before incarceration. When the parent is incarcerated, the household loses this income, and relatives caring for the children may incur additional expense in trying to maintain the parent-child relationship through visitation or phone contact. While incarcerated, the parent may have limited access to interventions leading to employment and income generation after release. In addition, a history of incarceration can be stigmatizing, making post-incarceration employment more difficult to obtain. Not surprisingly, one 2005 study reported that the mean postrelease annual income for women in the United States was $6827 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Custodial status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child's custodial status during the parent's incarceration varies depending upon whether it is the father or the mother who is incarcerated. Most children with an incarcerated father are cared for by their biologic mother, whereas children whose mother is incarcerated often are cared for by a grandparent or other relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. When a child's mother is incarcerated, the child is more likely to be involved with the child welfare system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-foster-care-placement-and-overview-of-the-foster-care-system-in-the-united-states#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of foster care placement and overview of the foster care system in the United States&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies relying on parent or caregiver report have identified multiple behavioral reactions to parental incarceration, including sadness, social withdrawal, acting out, and aggression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. These depend, in part, on the timing and duration of the parent's absence. Boys are more likely to display externalizing behaviors (eg, acting out and aggression), whereas girls are more likely to exhibit internalizing behaviors (eg, sadness, social withdrawal). Children with lower levels of social support have higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Children who are less hopeful, after accounting for stress and social support, also have more behavior problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available on the cognitive development of children of incarcerated parents. One 2005 study of 59 children aged 2.5 to 7.5 years with an incarcerated mother reported that 42 percent scored at or below 84 on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This is consistent with results from studies of young children at risk for cognitive problems because of foster care involvement for any reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the former study, poorer cognitive outcome was associated with higher caregiver risk status and mediated by the quality of the family environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Longitudinal effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon retrospective reports from incarcerated individuals regarding incarceration of other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], it is often suggested that children of offenders are significantly more likely to become offenders themselves. However, there have been few studies to evaluate the long-term effects of parental incarceration. A literature review identified several studies of inmates' children with a longitudinal design, and few studies followed children for more than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Delinquency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In retrospective reports, compared with juvenile offenders without a history of parental incarceration, juvenile offenders with a history of parental incarceration were more frequently involved with the juvenile justice system by age 12 years and were more likely to have committed previous serious offenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In several longitudinal studies, parental incarceration was strongly predictive of later delinquency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>] and criminality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, this was attenuated by family factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a study of adolescents, recent or past parental incarceration did not independently predict child delinquency after family <span class=\"nowrap\">victimization/conflict,</span> which was associated with incarceration, and sibling delinquency were added to the prediction equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In addition, after controlling for criminality and independently predictive risks (such as poverty), parent-child separation related to incarceration in one study resulted in poorer adult outcomes than separation resulting from other causes. Specifically, children experiencing parental incarceration were significantly more likely to exhibit antisocial behavior into early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, in a study from Sweden, parental incarceration was not associated with offspring offending independent of parental criminality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include shorter sentences, more family-friendly prison programs, and different social policies in Sweden than in some other countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Mental and physical health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies that incorporate parental incarceration or separation into measures of cumulative risk have shown an association between an increased number of adverse childhood experiences and later affective disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/27,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,37</a>], as well as lifetime risk of attempted suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-children-of-incarcerated-parents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The incarceration process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with incarcerated parents often have multiple risk factors for behavior and developmental problems, including poverty, parental substance use and mental illness, domestic violence, and inconsistent or unavailable caregivers. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Effects of parental incarceration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral reactions to parental incarceration may include sadness, social withdrawal, acting out, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aggression. These reactions can be mediated by high levels of social support. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parental incarceration is associated with juvenile delinquency, antisocial behavior, and health problems in adolescence, and may be associated with affective disorders and lifetime risk of attempted suicide. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Longitudinal effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric health care providers should screen for parental incarceration as a risk for developmental, behavior, and health problems, and provide age-appropriate counseling and information or referral for the child and family as indicated. <span class=\"nowrap\">Family/caregiver</span> stress may be decreased by referring eligible families for financial support, housing and childcare assistance, and legal advocacy.
