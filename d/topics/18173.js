Prenatal care presents a unique opportunity for evaluation and management of latent and active tuberculosis among individuals with risk of tuberculosis who may not otherwise present for medical care. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TB infection is caused by inhalation of viable bacilli, which may persist in an inactive state (known as latent TB infection [LTBI]) or progress to active TB disease. Individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) are asymptomatic and not contagious. Latent TB bacilli remain viable and may reactivate, causing active symptomatic TB disease, which can be transmitted via airborne spread. (See <a href=\"#H4159545334\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of TB in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H648172105\"><span class=\"h2\">Latent tuberculosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for latent tuberculosis infection during pregnancy should be pursued only in the setting of significant risk factors for progression to active disease during pregnancy (which warrant prompt treatment for LTBI); these are recent infection or significant immunocompromise. A decision to test presupposes a decision to treat promptly (even during the first trimester) if the test is positive; there is no role for routine LTBI testing in pregnant women with no risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H2337420649\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1857772024\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic tools for latent tuberculosis include tuberculin skin testing (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Definitions of positive TST are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67357 \">table 1</a>). Patients with a positive TST or IGRA must undergo clinical evaluation to rule out active tuberculosis; this includes evaluation for symptoms (eg, fever, cough, weight loss) and radiographic examination of the chest (with appropriate shielding), regardless of gestational age. (See <a href=\"#H3629654729\" class=\"local\">'How to test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3239420538\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation after positive test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> for treatment of LTBI in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73637 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We use daily therapy or directly observed twice-weekly therapy for nine months. For patients with difficulties related to adherence, shorter regimens are alternatives.

In addition, it can be difficult to recognize weight loss during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to diagnosis of active tuberculosis in pregnant women is the same as in nonpregnant individuals; it consists of clinical history (with epidemiologic assessment) and physical examination, followed by chest radiography (with appropriate shielding to protect the fetus). Chest imaging suggestive of pulmonary TB should prompt submission of three sputum specimens (coughed or induced) for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture as well as at least one sputum specimen for <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> nucleic acid amplification testing. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the initial treatment regimen for active TB in pregnancy (for presumed drug-susceptible disease) consist of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> administered for two months followed by isoniazid and rifampin for seven months, for a total of nine months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyrazinamide</a> is not absolutely necessary as part of a first-line regimen and is not used routinely for treatment of pregnant women in the United States because of limited safety data; however, its use is gaining acceptance and it is beneficial in the setting of HIV coinfection, extrapulmonary TB, or severe TB.
