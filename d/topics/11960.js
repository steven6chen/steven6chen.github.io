In fact, you will probably need to change the way you eat <strong>before</strong> you get pregnant. You will also need to start taking a multivitamin that has <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a> in it.</p><p>If you want to get pregnant, see your doctor or nurse before you start trying. He or she will explain how your diet needs to change and outline the steps you can take to have the healthiest pregnancy possible.</p><p>Eating the right foods will help your baby's development. Your baby will need nutrients from these foods to form normally and grow.</p><p>Eating the wrong foods could harm your baby. For example, if you eat cheese made from unpasteurized milk or raw or undercooked meat, you could get an infection that could lead to a miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb. Likewise, if you take too much <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin A</a> (more than 10,000 international units a day) in a vitamin supplement, your baby could be born with birth defects.</p><p>Making healthy food choices is also important for your health as a mother. As your baby grows and changes inside you, it will take nutrients from your body. You will have to replace these nutrients to stay healthy and have all the energy you need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356297\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods should I eat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best diet for you and your baby will include lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, some low-fat dairy products, and a few sources of protein, such as meat, fish, eggs, or dried peas or beans. If you do not eat dairy foods, you will need to get calcium from other sources.</p><p>If you are a vegetarian, speak to a nutritionist (food expert) about your food choices. Vegetarian diets can sometimes be missing nutrients that are important for a growing baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356312\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I prepare food differently?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. You need to be extra careful about avoiding germs in your food. Getting an infection while you are pregnant can cause serious problems.</p><p>Here's what you should do to avoid germs in your food:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands well with soap and water before you handle food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure to fully cook fish, chicken, beef, eggs, and other meats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under lots of running water before you eat them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When you are done preparing food, wash your hands and anything that touched raw meat or fish with hot soapy water. This includes countertops, cutting boards, and knives and spoons.</p><p/><p>To reduce the risk of germs in food, you should also avoid foods that can easily carry germs, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raw sprouts (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk, cheese, or juice that has not been pasteurized (also called unpasteurized)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356327\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods should I avoid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should avoid certain types of fish and all forms of alcohol. You should also limit the amount of caffeine in your diet, and check with your doctor before taking herbal products.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fish</strong> &ndash; You should not eat types of fish that could have a lot of mercury in them. These include shark, swordfish, king mackerel, marlin, and tilefish (from the Gulf of Mexico). Mercury is a metal that can keep the baby's brain from developing normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You can eat types of fish and seafood that are very low in mercury. In fact, eating these kinds of fish is good for your baby's development, as long as you don't eat them too often. Each week, experts suggest eating:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>2 to 3</strong> servings of fish <strong>very low</strong> in mercury &ndash; These include shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><strong>or</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>1</strong> serving of fish <strong>low</strong> in mercury &ndash; These include bluefish, grouper, halibut, mahi mahi, and yellowfin tuna. Tuna steaks are also OK to eat, but only 1 time a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Check with your doctor or nurse about the safety of other types of seafood, including fish caught in local rivers and lakes. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has more information about specific types of fish on their website (<a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/fishadvice&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IKduxkxYWKJhc5r3sgdDrbJtsNpWUUoyR3KeATuS4xDR&amp;TOPIC_ID=16631\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/fishadvice</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alcohol</strong> &ndash; You should avoid alcohol completely. Even small amounts of alcohol could harm a baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Caffeine</strong> &ndash; Limit the amount of caffeine in your diet by not drinking more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee each day. Tea and cola also have caffeine, but not as much as coffee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sugary drinks</strong> &ndash; Avoid or limit drinks with lots of sugar, such as soda and sports drinks. These are not good for your health at any time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Herbal products</strong> &ndash; Check with your doctor or nurse before using herbal products. Some herbal teas might not be safe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356342\"><span class=\"h1\">What are prenatal vitamins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal vitamins are vitamin supplements that you take the month before and all through your pregnancy. These vitamins, which also contain minerals (iron, calcium), help make sure that your baby has all the building blocks he or she needs to form healthy organs. Prenatal vitamins help lower the risk of birth defects and other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356357\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I look for in prenatal vitamins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can buy prenatal vitamins from a store or pharmacy. Choose a multivitamin that's labeled &quot;prenatal&quot; and that has at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. Folic acid is especially important in preventing certain birth defects. Show your doctor or nurse the vitamins you plan to take to make sure the doses are right for you and your baby. Too much of some vitamins can be harmful.</p><p>Your doctor can also prescribe a prenatal vitamin for you. Prescription vitamins often have more of some vitamins and minerals than the ones found in stores. For example, your doctor might give you a prescription if he or she thinks you need extra iron. It's important to get enough iron while you're pregnant. This can help prevent a condition called &quot;iron deficiency anemia.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356372\"><span class=\"h1\">How much weight should I gain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That will depend on how much you weigh to begin with. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how much weight gain is right for you. In general, a woman who is a healthy weight should gain 25 to 35 pounds during her pregnancy. A woman who is overweight or obese should gain less weight.</p><p>If you start to lose weight, for example, because you have severe morning sickness, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356387\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I can't afford to eat well?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you can't afford healthy food, ask your doctor or nurse for information about programs that can help you. In the US, there is a government program called &quot;WIC&quot; that helps women and their families get the nutrition they need. Many states and towns also have local programs to help women who are pregnant or nursing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356402\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b12-deficiency-and-folate-folic-acid-deficiency-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin B12 deficiency and folate (folic acid) deficiency (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-health-and-nutrition-during-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Maternal health and nutrition during breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
