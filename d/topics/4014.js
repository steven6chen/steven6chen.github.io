Once considered relatively avirulent and a likely contaminant when isolated from a clinical specimen, these organisms have increasingly been recognized as a cause of clinically significant nosocomial bloodstream infections. Patients at particular risk include those with prosthetic valves, pacemakers, defibrillators, ventricular assist devices, intravascular catheters, or other foreign bodies as well as neonates and immunocompromised hosts. These infections are inherently difficult to treat given the propensity of these organisms to colonize foreign material to form a biofilm and to display resistance to multiple antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The following discussion will emphasize the issues specific to both native valve endocarditis (NVE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) caused by CoNS. Discussion of CoNS infections at other sites is also included.

Patients with NVE due to CoNS had a longer duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis as compared with patients with NVE due to <em>S. aureus</em>; despite this apparent delay in diagnosis, embolic events were less frequent among patients with NVE caused by CoNS.

In a series of 69 cases of PVE due to CoNS, 33 occurred between 60 and 365 days, and 82 percent of strains were <em>S. epidermidis</em>; 57 percent underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-clinical-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Early cases occurring within the first year are thought to result from introduction of bacteria at the time of surgery. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were also the most frequent isolates in cases of transcatheter implanted aortic valve endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-clinical-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The infecting isolates in early PVE usually have a phenotype characteristic of nosocomial acquisition; they tend to form biofilm and to be resistant to multiple antibiotic families. CoNS have been isolated from numerous sources in the operating room, including bypass equipment, bone saws, and the prosthesis itself, and surgeons have been implicated as the source of contamination in point-source outbreaks for both wound infections and PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-clinical-manifestations/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Early PVE due to CoNS is often locally destructive. In one series of 55 patients, prosthetic valve dysfunction due to annular infection was found in 38 patients and perivalvular extension resulting in abscess formation in 17 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-clinical-manifestations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The main challenge in interpreting blood cultures positive for CoNS in patients with PVE is distinguishing infection from contamination. Obtaining multiple blood cultures, separated over time, with assiduous attention to sterile technique to minimize culture contamination, is crucial in making this distinction. If a patient with a prosthetic valve has sporadically positive cultures, evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility and techniques for determining the clonal origin of CoNS isolates should be applied.
