Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely. Epilepsy can start at any age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966091\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a seizure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different kinds of seizures. Each causes a different set of symptoms. Most seizures last only a few seconds or minutes.</p><p>People who have &quot;tonic clonic&quot; or &quot;grand mal&quot; seizures often pass out, get stiff, and then have jerking movements. Other types of seizures cause less dramatic symptoms. For instance, some people have shaking movements in just 1 arm or in a part of their face. Other people suddenly stop responding and stare for a few seconds.</p><p>Sometimes, people can tell that they are about to have a seizure. They have a certain feeling or smell a certain smell. This feeling or smell is called an &quot;aura.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966106\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will probably have 1 or both of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EEG &ndash; An EEG measures electrical activity in the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55691 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT or MRI scan &ndash; These tests create pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966121\"><span class=\"h1\">How is epilepsy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epilepsy is treated with anti-seizure medicines. These medicines can't cure epilepsy, but they can help prevent seizures. There are different anti-seizure medicines. The right one for you depends on your seizures and other factors.</p><p>Anti-seizure medicines usually work well to control seizures. But if they don't control your seizures, your doctor might talk with you about other possible treatments. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a &quot;vagus nerve stimulator&quot; that goes in your chest to help control seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966136\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about anti-seizure medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These medicines can cause side effects. They can make you feel tired or dizzy, or cause other problems. Let your doctor know about any side effects you have. That way, together you can find the best medicine and dose for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are 2 rare side effects that can be very serious. Let your doctor know right away if you get a new rash or feel like hurting yourself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-seizure medicines can affect other medicines you take. Plus, other medicines can keep your anti-seizure medicine from working well. Let your doctor know if you start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines, including birth control pills. Anti-seizure medicines can keep birth control pills from working well. This can lead to an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You might need regular blood tests to check the amount of anti-seizure medicine in your body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966159\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need anti-seizure medicine for the rest of my life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your seizures. If you don't have any seizures for 2 years, your doctor might talk with you about stopping your medicine. But don't ever stop your medicine on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966174\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I lower my chances of having more seizures?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To lower your chances of having more seizures, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your medicine exactly as directed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get enough sleep &ndash; Not getting enough sleep raises your chances of having a seizure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking alcohol or using drugs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966189\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I drive if I have epilepsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each state and country has its own rules. Before you can drive again, you will probably need to be seizure-free for a certain amount of time. You might also need to get your doctor's permission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966204\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk with your doctor before you get pregnant. He or she might change your medicine or prescribe a vitamin called folate. But don't ever stop your medicine on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966219\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will make a plan with you that tells you when to call him or her. In general, call your doctor or nurse if you have more seizures than usual or your seizures last longer than usual.</p><p>Some seizures are a medical emergency. <strong>If your seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if you have repeated seizures over a few minutes, the person with you should call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966234\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do if I have epilepsy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a medical bracelet to let others know about your epilepsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let family members and friends know how to help you if you have a seizure. They can position you so that you will not hurt yourself, but they should <strong>not</strong> put anything in your mouth. They should time your seizure and <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if it lasts longer than 5 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24966249\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eeg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: EEG (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-to-stop-driving-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Time to stop driving?
