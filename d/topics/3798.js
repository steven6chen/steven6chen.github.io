These fibrils adopt a beta-pleated sheet configuration that leads to characteristic histologic changes. Amyloid deposits can occur in a variety of organs, with involvement of the heart, kidney, liver, and autonomic nervous system most often being responsible for morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of cardiac involvement varies among types of amyloidosis. The prognosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy also varies among types of amyloidosis, with high mortality rates, particularly in light-chain amyloidosis.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy. The prognosis and treatment of amyloid cardiomyopathy is discussed separately.

The three most common types of amyloidosis, defined by their precursor proteins, are light-chain (AL), familial or senile (ATTR), and secondary (AA) amyloidosis. The frequency and severity of cardiac involvement varies among various types of amyloidosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In AL (primary) amyloidosis, a plasma cell dyscrasia, the amyloid protein consists of a monoclonal light chain. Clinical evidence of cardiac involvement occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] compared with less than 5 percent with AA amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

By comparison, there was no change in diastolic function with infusion of light chains from patients with no or mild cardiac involvement or from patients with multiple myeloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a study in isolated cardiac myocytes, light chains from patients with cardiac amyloidosis caused an increase in oxidant stress with alteration of the cellular redox state; these biochemical changes were associated with impairment in myocyte contractility and relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Subsequent data suggest that light-chain toxicity is mediated by lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In ATTR amyloidosis, the amyloid protein consists of wild-type (non-mutant) or mutated transthyretin (TTR, previously called prealbumin). Transthyretin (TTR) is a small protein tetramer that is almost exclusively produced in the liver. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wild-type (non-mutated) transthyretin is responsible for senile systemic amyloidosis, the predominant feature of which is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mutations in the gene for TTR are often associated with amyloid cardiomyopathy. In transthyretin-associated amyloidosis due to a mutation in the transthyretin molecule (ATTR), the presence of cardiac involvement varies with the specific mutation (of which over 100 have been described) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some mutations are invariably associated with cardiac disease, others usually only with neurologic disease, and many have a combination of both. Mutant TTR is the main cause of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy.

Angina, presyncope, and syncope may occasionally be the presenting features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Non-specific symptoms, often due to involvement of other organs (most commonly occurring in light-chain [AL] amyloidosis) include poor appetite, early satiety, and weight loss. Low cardiac output may also contribute to renal dysfunction, which in light-chain (AL) amyloidosis may already have been compromised by amyloid deposition in the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2728666\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs of heart failure include dyspnea and signs of right-sided heart failure including peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>). Although left heart pressures are elevated, pulmonary edema is rare. As demonstrated by necropsy studies as well as clinical imaging studies, the ventricular walls are typically thickened with normal left ventricular cavity size, normal-sized or mildly dilated right ventricular cavity, and biatrial enlargement.</p><p>An uncommon presentation is disproportionate amyloid accumulation in the ventricular septum, mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]. Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can occur but is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726667\"><span class=\"h3\">Small vessel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small vessel disease may manifest as purpura, claudication, or angina. The presence of periorbital purpura, often occurring with coughing, sneezing, or very minor trauma, suggests capillary involvement and its presence in a patient with unexplained heart failure strongly suggests amyloidosis, almost always of the AL type. Leg or jaw claudication are suggestive of vascular amyloidosis and may occur in conjunction with angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The involved cardiac vessels are typically small and intramyocardial; as a result, coronary angiography is usually normal or shows only minor abnormalities as discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726688\"><span class=\"h3\">Syncope and sudden death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syncope or presyncope is common in patients with cardiac amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The presence of exertional syncope is particularly ominous, as it may represent an inability to augment cardiac output. It is associated with a high mortality in the three months after the initial event, often due to sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Multiple additional factors may contribute to syncope. These include postural or exertional hypotension due to excessive diuresis or autonomic neuropathy. </p><p>Interestingly, ventricular arrhythmias appear to be an infrequent cause of syncope, possibly because the amyloid heart reacts poorly to hypoperfusion and any tachyarrhythmia severe enough to cause loss of consciousness is usually fatal. Observational data suggest that implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy may not prolong survival in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, probably because the majority of sudden cardiac deaths are due to electromechanical dissociation rather than a potentially reversible ventricular arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This was demonstrated in a small study using implantable loop recorders in patients with severe cardiac amyloidosis, in which bradycardia was the cause of all eight evaluable deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy#H16788171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of amyloid cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2731037\"><span class=\"h3\">Conduction system disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite widespread involvement of the conduction system, high-degree atrioventricular block is an unusual feature in AL amyloidosis, and symptomatic sinus node dysfunction appears uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In contrast, progressive conduction system disease often occurs in the ATTR amyloidoses (both senile and familial) and pacemaker implantation is often required. </p><p>The conduction system is often affected in all forms of amyloid heart disease. Although the sinus node may be most often involved pathologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], abnormal electrophysiologic function appears to be most common in the His-Purkinje system. Patients with AL amyloidosis may have progressive conduction disease, the severity of which may not be apparent from the surface electrocardiogram. This was illustrated in a study of 25 patients with AL amyloidosis involving the heart undergoing electrophysiologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Sinus and atrioventricular nodal function were preserved in most patients, but infra-His conduction times were usually prolonged, as 23 and 12 patients had His-ventricular (HV) intervals greater than 55 and 80 msec, respectively. Prolongation of the HV interval may not be suspected clinically if the QRS is narrow on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Prolongation of the HV interval was the sole independent predictor of subsequent sudden death but prolongation of the HV interval may not be suspected since the QRS is often narrow on the ECG. </p><p>However, the role of screening for these abnormalities is uncertain since limited clinical experience suggests that pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation often fails to prevent sudden cardiac death, which in many cases is probably due to electromechanical dissociation related to the severe myocardial dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726702\"><span class=\"h3\">Pericardial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloid deposits in the pericardium may occasionally result in a pericardial effusion, which may rarely produce cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Because of the increased stiffness of the atrial and ventricular walls and the high filling pressures in both ventricles, the classical echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, such as right atrial and right ventricular compression, may be absent so that a high degree of suspicion of cardiac tamponade should be entertained in a patient with a moderate or large pericardial effusion associated with amyloid heart disease and heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726709\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboembolism and stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, particularly those with AL amyloidosis or atrial fibrillation, are at risk for cardiac thromboembolism. Amyloid infiltrates the atria as well as the ventricles and may cause atrial dysfunction, resulting in electromechanical dysfunction of the atrium during sinus rhythm which can predispose to atrial thrombi. </p><p>A report of 116 autopsy or explanted cardiac amyloidosis cases identified intracardiac thrombus, predominantly in the atrium, in 33 percent of amyloid hearts (and none in 46 control hearts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although AL subjects were younger and had less atrial fibrillation than those with other types of amyloidosis, the AL group had a significantly higher rate of intracardiac thrombus (51 versus 16 percent) and fatal embolic events (26 versus 8 percent). The presence of both atrial fibrillation and AL amyloidosis was associated with an extremely high risk for thromboembolism (odds ratio 55, 95% CI 8.1-1131). Other risk factors for thromboembolism included left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, increased right ventricular wall thickness, and faster heart rates, the latter presumably representing a compensatory response to a low stroke volume.</p><p>The risk of ischemic stroke in patients with amyloidosis is not well defined. In a series of 40 patients with primary amyloidosis and ischemic stroke evaluated at the Mayo Clinic, ischemic stroke was the initial presentation of amyloidosis in 13 (33 percent), preceding a pathologic diagnosis of amyloidosis by a mean of 9.6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The majority of patients (70 percent) had cardioembolic strokes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010208\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropathic signs such as numbness, paresthesia, pain, orthostatic hypotension, and bowel or bladder dysfunction are frequently prominent in patients with AL or mutant TTR amyloidosis. Carpal tunnel syndrome is seen in some patients with AL, senile systemic amyloidosis, or TTR mutations.

Patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis typically present at age &ge;40 years. Patients with senile cardiac amyloidosis typically present at age &ge;60 years, and most commonly &gt;70 years. Various transthyretin mutations are associated with various ages of onset (ranging from 30 to 70 years) and differing risks of cardiomyopathy as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2731422\" class=\"local\">'TTR mutation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010302\"><span class=\"h3\">Type-specific course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated AL amyloidosis carries a poor prognosis, which varies depending on the predominant organ involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When the heart is involved, the prognosis of an untreated patient is particularly poor. In contrast to AL amyloidosis, familial and senile amyloidoses are typically associated with milder clinical manifestations, slower progression, and better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26-28</a>]. This distinction was illustrated in a comparison of 36 patients with amyloid heart disease: 24 with AL amyloidosis and 12 with familial (mostly ATTR) amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although the two groups had similar echocardiographic findings, the one-year survival rates free of cardiac transplantation were 38 and 92 percent, respectively, and all deaths were cardiac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68010 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a study of 18 randomly selected patients with AL amyloidosis that involved the heart and 18 with senile systemic TTR amyloidosis and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although the patients with AL amyloidosis were younger and had a lesser degree of thickening of the left ventricle, median survival was much shorter (11 versus 75 months). The difference in outcome in these studies could not be explained by the degree of amyloid infiltration of the myocardium as assessed by echocardiography and led to speculation that the rapid progression of heart failure in AL amyloidosis is due to a toxic effect of circulating light chains on a myocardium already damaged by amyloid deposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27259717\"><span class=\"h3\">AL cardiac amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AL amyloidosis is a plasma cell dyscrasia usually involving one or more organ systems. Common presentations of AL amyloidosis include nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, peripheral neuropathy, macroglossia, purpura (including periorbital purpura, known as raccoon eyes), and bleeding diathesis. While none of these features is pathognomonic for AL amyloidosis, periorbital purpura and macroglossia in a patient with amyloidosis strongly suggest AL amyloidosis rather than another type. Cardiac involvement is present in at least 50 percent of patients and is the predominant manifestation of the disease in approximately 20 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29</a>]. In a series of patients with AL amyloidosis, isolated cardiac involvement was rare, occurring in isolation in only 4 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this is probably an underestimation of the true prevalence, as patients with isolated cardiac disease do not manifest the diagnostic clues seen in multisystem disease, and may progress and die without a diagnosis.

This mutation, which is present in 3 to 4 percent of the African-American and Afro-Caribbean populations, is associated with a late-onset amyloid cardiomyopathy characterized by progressive severe heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,37</a>]. It should be suspected in any patient of African descent over the age of 50 who has unexplained left wall thickening on the echocardiogram and heart failure or echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A common mistake is to attribute ventricular wall thickening in these patients to hypertensive heart disease, but the degree of LV thickening (commonly &gt;15 mm) is usually disproportionate to the degree of hypertension and right-sided signs of heart failure (uncommon in hypertensive heart disease) are frequently present due to concomitant right ventricular infiltration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A prospective community-based observational study of 124 carriers and 3732 noncarriers suggested that the penetrance of disease caused by the Val122Ile mutation is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. After 21.5 years of follow-up (starting at a median age of 53 years), there was no significant difference in mortality between carriers and noncarriers (33 versus 37 percent), though carriers had an increased risk of incident heart failure (age- and sex-stratified hazard ratio 1.47; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.10). Carriers had higher plasma levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and worse systolic and diastolic function. However, a phenotype suggestive of amyloid cardiomyopathy was present in only three (7 percent) carriers and 11 (1 percent) non-carriers. It is unknown whether longer follow-up would lead to greater detection of disease, but the median age of the subjects at the time of the final echocardiographic examination was well within the range at which most patients with this mutation generally present. These results suggest that &ldquo;classical&rdquo; TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy is much less common in carriers of the Val122Ile gene than previously thought. They also imply that a relatively small amount of amyloid, insufficient to cause LV wall thickening on echocardiography, may contribute to heart failure, possibly aggravated by the presence of a coexistent cardiovascular disease such as hypertension. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the most common mutations is a substitution of methionine for valine at codon 30 (Val30Met). This mutation is common in endemic areas such as Portugal, northern Sweden, and Japan, and most often presents with a lower extremity sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (known as familial amyloid polyneuropathy). Although cardiac involvement occurs and echocardiographic manifestations may not be distinguishable from AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26,27,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,40</a>], these patients generally have much less severe myocardial disease and better survival than those with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There appears to be a bimodal age of onset in this mutation, with early onset (third and fourth decade) presenting with peripheral neuropathy and minimal cardiac infiltration except for conduction system disease and late onset disease (sixth decade) presenting predominantly as an infiltrative amyloid cardiomyopathy.

Amyloid deposits are frequently found in the hearts of elderly patients at autopsy, both in the atrium (where they are usually derived from atrial natriuretic peptide) and the ventricle (where they are most commonly derived from wild-type TTR). In the overwhelming majority of cases, these deposits are of no clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, there is an association between atrial amyloidosis and atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 136 cases of cardiac amyloidosis in individuals over 60 years old from a series of 52,370 autopsies, the prevalence of ventricular amyloid deposition increased with age and was higher among blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The prevalence in the 70- to 79-year age group was 1.6 percent among blacks and 0.1 percent among whites, and in those 90 years of age and older, the rates were 8.2 percent of blacks and 2.7 percent of whites. Among all autopsied individuals over 60 years old, the incidence of cardiac amyloidosis was 1.6 percent among blacks, 0.42 percent in non-Hispanic whites, and 0.13 percent in Mexican Hispanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A genetic cause for the higher prevalence of cardiac amyloid in blacks is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H2731422\" class=\"local\">'TTR mutation'</a> above.)</p><p>However, in a small proportion of patients, the ventricular deposition is massive, resulting in cardiomegaly and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The term senile cardiac amyloidosis is best reserved for these cases, since it is associated with a typical echocardiographic appearance and clinical course. Senile cardiac amyloidosis may be the most common form of amyloidosis in the United States. It almost exclusively affects elderly men (35 of 36, with a mean age of 73 in two reports from the United States, and 88 of 102 in a later report from the United Kingdom.) It is characterized by an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,50,51</a>]. Wild-type TTR may also be deposited in the lungs, hence the term &quot;senile systemic amyloidosis&quot; rather than senile cardiac amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, the lung deposition is clinically insignificant and the clinical picture is heart failure. Although patients with senile cardiac amyloidosis are older and have a greater degree of left ventricular thickening than those with cardiac AL amyloidosis, heart failure is much easier to control and there is a much slower rate of disease progression than in AL amyloidosis (median survival 75 versus 11 months in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs in a substantial minority of patients and TTR deposition may contribute to lumbar spinal stenosis but, unlike other forms of amyloidosis, clinically significant disease in other major organs is generally absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Of note, 24 percent of patients with biopsy-proven wild-type ATTR had evidence of an unrelated plasma cell dyscrasia when evaluated by sensitive techniques, underscoring the point that the combination of amyloid and a plasma cell dyscrasia does not necessarily indicate AL type amyloidosis.

Most of the 58 thrombi were in the left (n = 32) or right (n = 10) atrial appendage and only three thrombi were detected by transthoracic echocardiography. Light-chain (AL) amyloid patients had intracardiac thrombus more frequently than patients with other types (predominantly transthyretin [TTR]) (35 versus 18 percent). This was despite AL patients being younger and having less atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation, poor left ventricular diastolic function, and lower left atrial appendage emptying velocity were independently associated with increased risk for intracardiac thrombosis, whereas anticoagulation at the time of the echocardiogram was associated with a significantly decreased risk. </p><p>Based on these data and the autopsy data described above showing a very high prevalence of intracardiac thrombi, it is reasonable to assume that a patient with cardiac amyloidosis and an embolic event has a cardiac source. In such a case, transesophageal echocardiography may not be necessary to aid in the decision to initiate anticoagulation. As a corollary, the finding of a diminutive transmitral A wave on transthoracic echocardiography in a patient with cardiac amyloidosis may be an adequate reason to initiate anticoagulation even in the absence of a prior embolus. Selective use of transesophageal echocardiography is suggested in such patients to guide the need for prophylactic anticoagulation, looking not only for the presence of intracardiac thrombi, but also for high risk features such as very low left atrial appendage Doppler velocities even in the absence of a thrombus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1397433\"><span class=\"h2\">Voltage-to-mass ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular thickening due to amyloid infiltration may be misdiagnosed on echocardiography as left ventricular hypertrophy.

Twelve patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis, 16 with wild-type TTR, and 17 with mutant TTR cardiomyopathy underwent 99mTc-pyrophosphate planar and SPECT cardiac imaging, with assessment by both a semiquantitative visual score (range, 0; no uptake to 3, diffuse uptake) and by quantitative analysis.
