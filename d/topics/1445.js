Therefore, survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and includes the periods of initial treatment with intent to cure, cancer-free survival, chronic or intermittent disease, and palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For the purposes of this topic, we will focus on the post-treatment period of survivorship.</p><p>There are now over 14 million cancer survivors in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and close to 30 million survivors worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Following cancer treatment, the roles and responsibilities for survivorship care should be well delineated for both patients and their providers, particularly during transitions. The follow-up of cancer survivors can be shared among the primary care provider (PCP), medical oncologist, and other cancer specialists, and is often transitioned to the PCP after the period of highest risk for disease recurrence (often five years, but sometimes longer). For survivors, the transition from oncology to primary care settings should be guided by the survivorship care plan (SCP), which is developed by the oncology team at the completion of treatment and is meant to be shared with the patient and his or her providers, including the PCP.</p><p>This topic will address the evidence supporting SCPs in cancer survivors, implementation, and barriers to implementation. An overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers is provided separately.

These include recurrent and new malignancies; increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular, skeletal, and other diseases; myriad physical effects such as peripheral neuropathy and lymphedema; and psychosocial distress that may impact work and social relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Expecting life to be better after cancer treatment may not be a correct assumption for all cancer survivors. One-third of cancer survivors have persisting symptoms that are similar to those they suffered during active treatment; fatigue, pain, depression, and sleep disruption are the most common across different malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Thus, the issues, risks, and corresponding care needs of cancer survivors are both complex and widely variable, contributing to myriad challenges to quality care for this burgeoning population.

As a result, cancer survivors are being referred back to their communities, especially if they have remained free of disease after three to five years. Unfortunately, primary care providers (PCPs) are already overburdened by an aging and increasingly complex client base. As a result, PCPs may not be adequately prepared to care for these survivors due to perceived knowledge gaps about the individualized needs, risks, and surveillance plans for cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. In addition, for most PCPs and oncology professionals, there is a lack of clarity about who is responsible for survivorship care delivery and less-than-optimal interprofessional communication between various providers. Coupled with other system-based issues, coordination of care for cancer survivors is often impaired, and most patients do not benefit from a carefully coordinated transition from active cancer treatment to cancer survivorship care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>].

Chief among their recommendations was that each patient should receive a cancer treatment summary and follow-up care plan, collectively called the survivorship care plan (SCP), to facilitate care transitions and guide the content and coordination of care following acute treatment, and foster greater self-management of health by cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Despite these efforts, the majority of cancer survivors in practice have yet to receive a formal SCP, in part due to myriad barriers to their development and delivery.

This situation is at least in part related to reduced frequency of contact with the primary oncologist when the patient's care is transferred back to the primary care provider (PCP), the lack of relevant care guidelines, and a continued lack of communication among providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/17,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28,29</a>].

Thus, in 2013 and 2014, both the ACS CoC and ASCO revisited their standards for SCP content and delivery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In September 2014, the ACS CoC published clarifications for their <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/research/oncology-roundtable/oncology-rounds/2014/09/the-coc-clarifies-the-survivorship-care-plan-standard-what-you-need-to-know&amp;token=uqmr/lfCIhap/40pE5Eoq4Q20Q7fZ/7DKX5IssFddEhPp+ea/vB83h75TVWsSKBtY5VA4RZIQBOhuiyXTCgZREYgLyhHpFlWKSKQIz7/ZlEjCzGOHt93FUVea9i3C9Y8fpplevw/kkOOtGUcR/dIhibAtXhqX+dOZ2TY/gn7iC0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17020\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Survivorship Care Plan standard 3.3</a>. The clarification describes the extent of information required to be included in a treatment summary and SCP and specifies which health care provider(s) should be responsible for gathering and delivering care plans. The clarification outlined a five-year phase-in plan to help ease the burden on cancer centers trying to deliver care plans to cancer survivors. Starting January 1, 2015, centers were required to deliver care plans to 10 percent of patients who were treated with curative intent upon the completion of active treatment. The percent increases annually such that by January 2017, at least half of all survivors must receive SCPs, and all survivors by January 2019.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In September 2013, ASCO convened a multi-stakeholder consensus conference on SCPs. The resulting ASCO Clinical Expert Statement on Cancer Survivorship Care Planning outlined the minimum essential elements of SCPs and assumptions around their delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Given the limited evidence to support efficacy of SCPs and the concerns of survivors that SCPs are &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot; to meet their needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], ASCO (and others) emphasizes that SCPs are intended to be an <strong>adjunct to</strong>, not a replacement for, quality survivorship care processes such as discussions between oncology teams and survivors about a follow-up plan of care. The minimal essential elements of an SCP as suggested by ASCO are further discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1072537738\" class=\"local\">'Content'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The ACS CoC standard has the greatest potential impact, given that 70 percent of all cancer patients in the United States are cared for in an ACS CoC-accredited institution. The ACS CoC specifically mandates that both a treatment summary and follow-up care plan be prepared by the principal oncology provider and delivered to patients upon completion of treatment. Although content should comply with the minimum standards as defined by the IOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], the most recent ACS CoC standard clarifications were helpful in specifying which patients should receive care plans, and when (five-year phase-in plan), as well as the required content for care plans. In September 2014, the CoC specifically endorsed the core set of data elements recommended by ASCO. ASCO's 2014 revised survivorship templates and care plans are more streamlined, with fewer diagnosis and treatment details and with a more personalized plan. Still, the ASCO templates are only currently customized for five specific cancers and require manual population of disease and treatment data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Data were required if they would influence follow-up care, and care team information was included to enable contact with treating oncology providers as required for ongoing or future care. Details such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy dose were not required, as it was recognized that if this level of detail were required in the future to guide a new treatment plan, then medical records could be obtained by the original treating providers. As a result, many previously required details outlined in the IOM standard, such as dose, were removed. It was also recognized that the amount and kind of data necessary to guide follow-up care vary between cancer types, and thus judgment would be needed within clinical practice.</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that SCP content should be tailored to reflect the needs and concerns of the individual survivor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], and the ASCO Clinical Expert Statement emphasized the need to tailor the posttreatment surveillance plan and the discussion of late effects to the individual survivor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Grant and philanthropic funding has been instrumental to the development and implementation of survivorship clinics at some centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/73,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,83</a>], but this strategy is unlikely to be sustainable.</p><p>Failure of current EMR systems to provide efficient solutions is a substantial barrier, although this is being actively addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], both within individual institutions as well as via the efforts of third-party vendors and solutions that are integrated with EMRs. Indeed, harnessing the ability of EMR systems is one strategy for improving the efficiency of preparing cancer SCPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/38,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,85</a>]; however, obstacles to this approach include an inability of many EMRs to easily translate cancer diagnostic and treatment data into an SCP template. However, case examples of successful EMR applications are growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].</p><p>Another approach, which has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, is the preparation of the TS by registered health information technicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Novel strategies such as group-based survivorship care planning visits and mailed SCPs are being explored as approaches to improve efficiency and decrease resource intensity of survivorship care planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/48,49,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49,86</a>], as is the longitudinal development and delivery of SCPs over a series of clinical visits rather than at a single clinical encounter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A number of issues must be considered when planning for the implementation of SCPs, including structure, process, and timing of delivery. To date, limited evidence is available to guide decision-making, since research determining best approaches is in its infancy. (See <a href=\"#H109078881\" class=\"local\">'Standards for implementation'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, clinical factors primarily influence the selected approach. Factors influencing decision-making include characteristics of both the patient population and the setting for care plan delivery (eg, are institutional resources available or not), as well as determination of the intended audience for the SCP. Grant and colleagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] propose a number of reflective questions that should be considered when implementing survivorship programs, including the delivery of SCPs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301134325\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following completion of initial treatment, more than 60 percent of individuals diagnosed with cancer will become long-term cancer survivors, living five years or more following their cancer diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H301133989\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Year 2006 recommendations to improve the quality of survivorship care from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) stated that each patient should receive a cancer treatment summary and follow-up care plan, collectively called the survivorship care plan (SCP), to facilitate care transitions and guide the content and coordination of care following acute treatment, and foster greater self-management of health by cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. SCPs are intended to provide critical information regarding diagnoses, treatments, and potential late effects, as well as recommended surveillance, preventive strategies, and education and referrals for management of other medical and psychosocial needs. The SCP should assist with coordination of care by outlining which providers are responsible for particular aspects of care and by recommending resources and individual referrals for ongoing issues related to cancer and its treatment. (See <a href=\"#H769479718\" class=\"local\">'Meeting the challenge'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the delivery of SCPs has been endorsed or required by a growing number of accrediting and organizing bodies. Although the data supporting benefit are limited, quality mandates for the delivery of SCPs have been put into place by the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer (ACS CoC), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC). (See <a href=\"#H1072537551\" class=\"local\">'Defining and measuring quality survivorship care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key components of the treatment summary and follow-up care plan as defined by a multi-stakeholder consensus conference held by ASCO (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101921 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101919 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assuring-quality-of-care-for-cancer-survivors-the-survivorship-care-plan/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] have been endorsed by the ACS CoC's accreditation committee. (See <a href=\"#H1072537738\" class=\"local\">'Content'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients living after cancer, a number of SCP templates have been created and are available for application to practice. An ideal SCP should be easy to read with understandable language, include contact information for all providers, and provide clear direction on who to contact, for what concerns, and when. However, the actual content of SCPs varies widely in practice, and there is no single gold standard or &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. (See <a href=\"#H109079012\" class=\"local\">'Templates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary care providers (PCPs) and survivors alike believe that SCPs would help improve the quality and coordination of survivorship care, provided that they are tailored to individual needs, concerns, and risks, and clearly articulate what is expected of the survivor as well as those providers involved in the survivor's care. To address barriers to delivery, novel information technology efforts may ease the resource burden of preparing and delivering SCPs. (See <a href=\"#H1072539142\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to implementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Research on outcomes of SCPs is growing, with single-arm studies showing improvement in a variety of patient outcomes, including knowledge and perceived quality and coordination of care, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yet to demonstrate benefit, which may be in part due to design issues. More research is needed. (See <a href=\"#H94373386\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for benefit'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Hewitt, M, Greenfield, S, Stovall, E, et al.
