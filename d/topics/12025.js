A common assumption has been that a medical intervention that improves pain and function will facilitate return to work and prevent disability. However, considerable evidence demonstrates that effective treatments for pain and function are not necessarily associated with favorable work and disability outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, multiple treatments have been developed with the specific intent to improve work return, productivity, and satisfaction, and minimize disability.</p><p>This discussion focuses on treatment aspects unique to patients with occupational low back pain. The evaluation of patients for occupational low back pain is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational low back pain: Evaluation&quot;</a>). Treatment for acute, subacute, and chronic nonspecific low back pain is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments that focus on work-related low back pain often are designed for implementation by clinicians who specialize in back conditions or occupational health. This does not imply that the primary care physician's only responsibility is to refer a patient for appropriate evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Frequently, the primary care physician does not have resource information about specific occupational programs. Inquiring about workplace interventions and programs through the patient's disability insurer may be helpful.</p><p>Progress toward return to work and resolution of a disability claim usually reflect contributions from many sources comprising a treatment team or system. This team often includes multiple &quot;stakeholders&quot; representing medical, legal, and occupational facets of the patient's disability: an <span class=\"nowrap\">adjudicator/case</span> manager from the insurer, the employer, a clinician, and the patient. Others may include a labor union representative, the employer's occupational health and safety department, and other health care and legal practitioners.</p><p>The role of the primary care clinician in the care of patients with persistent pain associated with work loss and disability is particularly important. The primary care physician has at least three responsibilities for such patients: to coordinate care and communication; to assure consistency in approach; and to advocate for the best medical interests of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>It should be acknowledged that multiple factors may contribute to discomfort experienced by the primary care clinician when addressing a person seeking consultation for work-related disability. Such factors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling ill-prepared due to lack of training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of futility in achieving successful outcome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about confidentiality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential for compromising the doctor-patient relationship</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time constraints in a busy schedule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate financial compensation for time spent completing forms and coordinating care</p><p/><p>This topic will outline an approach to treatment, in an attempt to alleviate at least some of these concerns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of medication is to control pain, usually in its acute, intense period. Pharmacologic management for patients with nonspecific acute, subacute and chronic low back pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the occupational setting, medications that alter alertness and coordination may be problematic when used as part of a return to work strategy. Certain industries, such as transportation, have specific regulations regarding the use of certain medication classes. Narcotic medications are also contraindicated for workers who use heavy machinery. Many employers have drug screening requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>One study reported a negative association between early receipt of opioids for acute low back pain and disability duration in the workers compensation setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Analysis of an insurance database of 8443 workers compensation claims found that patients with occupational low back pain who received the equivalent of over 450 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> within the first 15 days had 69 more days of disability than those who received no early opioids, after adjusting for injury severity and other covariates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of interventions have been designed to support the medical management of work-related low back pain, with the intent to prevent further injury and facilitate early return to the workplace.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to work advice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers should inquire early on about a patient's goals for return to work and support efforts for early work return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The recommendation to return to work by the patient's health care provider is quick, inexpensive and often effective as an intervention to promote functional restoration in occupational low back pain patients. In one randomized trial of 506 Belgium workers claiming disability related to low back pain, for example, workers were randomly assigned to disability evaluation only (control group) or counseling plus evaluation (intervention group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The group that received counseling, which included advice for return to work, had a higher rate of return to work at one year (96 percent, compared to 92 percent for the control group, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.07-5.29). Rates of recurrent sick leave were also lower in the counseling group, but duration of sick leave and subsequent surgery rates were similar to controls. The standard counseling included the following seven points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no sign of a serious disease other than a low back condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inflamed or cracked disc can cause reflex muscle activation, leading to stiffness and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being too careful with activity and rest could worsen the stiffness and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear and pain anticipation could increase the muscle activation and pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light activity could enhance the repair process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>50 percent of patients resume work safely in six weeks and the majority within three months of sick leave.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not let the low back pain be your guide.</p><p/><p>Although intuitively simple, return to work advice can be difficult to practically implement. The patient should be reassured that it is safe and beneficial to perform usual activities, even if some degree of pain persists. Early return to work can be seen as analogous to the recommendation that all patients with non-specific low back pain should remain as active as possible, despite their symptoms. Recommending return to work seeks to avoid the medicalization of nonmedical disability issues, and to avoid unnecessary tests and diagnoses that often accompany this process.</p><p>A number of different models of care incorporate the principle of early return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. One example is the SPICE model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simplicity &ndash; Avoid unnecessary diagnoses and medicalization of benign conditions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximity &ndash; Keep the worker in close contact with the workplace</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediacy &ndash; Deal with work-related symptoms in a timely manner</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centrality &ndash; All treating providers share a common goal and work together in close communication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectancy &ndash; Setting expectations for recovery and return to work often leads to fulfillment of those expectations</p><p/><p>Recommendations for usual activity are associated with earlier return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, one prospective study of 1438 rehabilitation patients with occupational low back pain evaluated the effect of work restrictions based on pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The study group was not advised restriction from work activities, whereas the control group was restricted from full activities when pain was reported. Twice as many patients returned to unrestricted work in the study group than in the control group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise therapy for occupational low back pain follows the treatment principles of low back pain in general. There is evidence that exercise therapy on the job site, or more closely aligned to a graded job activity program, is more successful at reducing work absence than usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Consensus is lacking on the optimum time to refer a worker to exercise therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-based therapy for low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Work restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a handful of studies have evaluated whether or not work restrictions are necessary or advisable in low back pain, and findings are contradictory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-20</a>]. Literature on the reproducibility and validity of functional testing to determine work limitations is cautionary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>There are two opposing perspectives regarding the impact of work restriction for occupational low back pain: that heavy lifting or repetitive loading can cause structural damage to the spine and further exacerbate underlying processes and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]; or that restrictions on lifting might reinforce workers' expectations of injury and have unintended adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The decision whether or not to advise work restrictions is determined ultimately by weighing relative risks and benefits. The assessment of risk by the worker and physician is based on both &quot;scientific&quot; (data-driven) and &quot;intuitive&quot; (qualitative) factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The adverse psychological and physical health consequences of disablement should be weighed against the potential for further injury with unrestricted work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It should be recognized, however, that an individual's function may be realistically limited by his or her tolerance of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Cooperation with the treating therapist to reassess and advance activities both in the rehabilitation facility and the workplace is essential to a satisfactory outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/7,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26,28</a>]. The primary care physician has the benefit of a long term relationship with the patient. Restrictions can be reassessed, modified or lifted as warranted by the clinical picture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ergonomic intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ergonomics is a discipline that involves arranging the environment to fit the person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Ergonomic assessments are typically done by an occupational health provider, often arranged through the patient's employer. Usual practice is that an occupational therapist attends the job site; assesses conditions, positions and forces involved in the worker's tasks; and makes recommendations to optimize the interaction between worker and work environment. Such recommendations may involve keyboard, desk or chair modifications, as well as lighting, ventilation, shift schedule, or other issues.</p><p>The target for ergonomic interventions, such as lifting and vibration, are well documented risk factors for back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Ergonomics are a common workplace intervention. However, evidence on the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions in preventing or treating low back pain is conflicting. Representative findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review from 2001 found that there were no properly randomized controlled trials evaluating ergonomic interventions, and could not determine the effectiveness of such interventions for prevention of back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another systematic review, from 2003, identified 10 studies of varying designs demonstrating a positive outcome from multifactorial musculoskeletal ergonomic interventions, and strong evidence that training healthcare workers in patient handling techniques was not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent randomized trial of low back pain prevention for 489 workers with physically demanding job tasks at nine worksites demonstrated no benefit from advice on ergonomic adjustments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 1600 workers in six countries who had been sick-listed with low back pain for three to four months found that ergonomic interventions (adaptation of workplace, job tasks, or working hours) improved the return-to-work rate of these workers, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 for rate of return-to-work for different interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>There is some support for the concept of &quot;participatory ergonomics&quot; as a treatment for occupational back pain. This intervention involves a group, led by an ergonomist, that includes the worker, the worker's supervisor, and possible other stakeholders. After observation by the ergonomist, group members independently rank obstacles for return to work and attempt to achieve consensus regarding feasible solutions. In a randomized controlled trial of 198 workers with occupational back pain leading to work disability for two to six weeks, participatory ergonomics was associated with decreased time to return to work (77 versus 104 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This approach may provide psychological as well as physical benefit to the worker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar supports</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of back braces or orthotic devices have been developed to provide passive support for the back. They have been used both for prevention and treatment of low back pain. Most studies have investigated their use in workplace settings.</p><p>A systematic review evaluated seven studies of the effectiveness of lumbar supports for prevention, and eight studies of effectiveness for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Overall study quality was considered to be low. The review concluded that lumbar supports alone were not effective for prevention of low back pain. The review was inconclusive whether lumbar supports were effective as supplements to other interventions for prevention or whether they were beneficial for treatment.</p><p>This corroborates findings of the NIOSH Back Belt Working Group which did not recommend the use of back belts to prevent injuries among uninjured workers, and did not consider back belts to be personal protective equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>In summary, lumbar supports are not recommended for primary prevention of low back pain. Whether or not they should be used in the treatment of back pain remains unclear, but the lack of evidence for prevention weakens its plausibility as a treatment for occupational low back pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Back schools and other educational interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Back schools typically exist outside of the traditional health care system and are managed by large companies or occupational health centers. Generally, lessons are provided to groups of patients and supervised by a physical therapist or other therapist trained in back rehabilitation. Outcomes from these programs typically focus on decreasing work loss and preventing long-term disability.</p><p>Back schools, originally developed in Sweden in the late 1960s, include education and skills-based training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The educational component aims to develop coping techniques through better understanding of the self-limiting nature of back pain. The skills component may be provided as part of a physical therapy program. The original Swedish back school program consisted of four group sessions over a two week period, and provided information on the anatomy of the back, biomechanics, optimal posture, ergonomics, and back exercises.</p><p>A systematic review of 19 trials found moderate evidence that back schools improve short-term recovery and return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, the review found that back schools did not result in decreased pain or long-term recurrence. Results were generally better in trials of back schools conducted in an occupational setting and for more intensive programs based on the original Swedish back school, though benefits were small. Other systematic reviews have reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. A subsequent study, however, found that a low-intensity back school, compared to a high intensity back school or no back school, was most effective in reducing work absence in the subacute group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of six randomized trials and five observational studies evaluated whether advice and training on techniques for lifting, as well as use of lifting equipment, could prevent back pain in workers involved with heavy lifting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Neither advice nor training, with or without lifting equipment, prevented back pain or disability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional restoration or work hardening programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional restoration, also known as work hardening, work conditioning, or physical conditioning, involves simulated or actual work tests in a supervised environment to improve strength, endurance, flexibility and fitness for injured workers. This often involves a multidisciplinary component, including physical and occupational therapy.</p><p>The goal is to directly support job performance and reassure the patient of his or her ability to return to work successfully. Functional restoration differs from back school in the emphasis on individualized physical therapy and exercise compared to group educational training for back school programs.</p><p>Functional restoration programs are diverse in terms of the intervention and the setting for the intervention, making outcomes difficult to compare between studies. A systematic review found functional restoration with a cognitive-behavioral component more effective than usual care, or standard exercise therapy, for reducing time lost from work, but little evidence of effectiveness without a cognitive-behavioral component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a subsequent randomized trial comparing functional restoration with active physiotherapy for patients with chronic low back pain, both groups improved at one year in terms of pain scores, endurance, and sick-leave days from baseline, but functional restoration was more effective in reducing sick-leave days than active physiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation therapy combines physical, vocational, and behavioral components provided by multiple health care professionals. Intensity and content of interdisciplinary therapy vary widely. These costly programs combine graded exercise therapy with a psychosocial approach, generally involving a psychologist. Interdisciplinary therapy can be similar to functional restoration programs but emphasize multiple different providers and behavioral interventions.</p><p>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is more effective than non-multidisciplinary rehabilitation or usual care in improving functional status and quicker return to work. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-based therapy for low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for surgical treatment for patients with low back pain should depend on the etiology, duration and response to conservative treatments, rather than occupational issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, work and disability factors are frequently considered when surgery is contemplated for occupational low back pain. A review of 129 studies demonstrated that surgical outcomes were worse when disability factors, usually workers' compensation, are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Few studies, however, have controlled for differences among patients with and without disability and there are no randomized trials that compare differences in surgical outcomes for patients with and without work-related conditions.</p><p>Surgery is most commonly considered for those with a disk herniation or chronic non-specific low back pain that is not improving with time and non-operative care. Few studies have compared surgical and non-operative outcomes for patients with occupational low back pain. The Maine Lumbar Spine Study, a prospective observational study of patients with a lumbar disk herniation and including individuals with workers' compensation claims, found no difference in work or disability outcomes over 10 year follow-up among patients initially treated with discectomy or non-operative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>For individuals with pain thought due to degenerative disc disease, including those with occupational low back pain, surgical fusion procedures with or without instrumentation may be considered. Randomized trials have not specifically addressed surgery for patients with work-related back pain, although eligibility criteria for most surgical trials include individuals of working age, and many trial participants were not working due to their back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Fusion surgery was superior to non-surgical therapy that did not include interdisciplinary rehabilitation in one trial of 294 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The rate of back to work was 36 percent for those treated surgically, compared to 13 percent for nonsurgical treatment. However, outcomes of fusion surgery were no more effective than interdisciplinary rehabilitation in three other trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a trial of 64 Norwegian patients, 22 percent of patients in the fusion group returned to work by one year, compared to 33 percent of those in the rehabilitation group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, few surgical patients had optimal outcomes (minimal pain, rare medication needs, and return to high level of function).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with occupational low back pain will improve. In a review of 15 studies of patients with low back pain, 82 percent of patients initially off work returned to work in one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Further improvement in pain response and ability to return to work leveled off after three months. Three quarters of patients in the studies had at least one recurrence within 12 months of their initial symptoms.</p><p>For patients who have been off work with low back pain for six months, the chance of ever returning to work has been estimated at 50 percent, and for those out of work for at least two years, the probability of return to work is near zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A study from Norway, based on a review of 89,000 insurance records, found that approximately 42 percent of those off work with back pain after six months had not returned to work after 12 months, and were switched to permanent disability pension or other compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for disability are similar to those for chronicity of low back pain, and include patient factors (depression, somatization), employment factors (job dissatisfaction), and legal factors (compensation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of medications to manage low back pain should take into account that opioid use is often not compatible with workplace responsibilities, especially where heavy equipment or transportation is involved. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacological treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treating low back pain to relieve discomfort and improve function does not inevitably lead to faster return to work or less work disability. A number of specific interventions have been designed to prevent further injury and facilitate early return to the workplace. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific occupational interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with work-related back pain be given specific advice that the pain does not need to be totally alleviated before returning to work (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is analogous to encouraging activity, rather than bedrest, for patients with low back pain. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Return to work advice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision whether to advise work modification should take into account whether accommodations are feasible, as well as the potential that work modification may reinforce fears about further harming oneself. Medical restrictions are not necessary for most cases of nonspecific low back pain. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Work restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using lumbar supports in the treatment of work-related low back pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest not using lumbar supports for primary prevention of low back pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar supports'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For workers with persistent symptoms, we suggest a trial of back school or functional restoration with a behavioral component to promote early return to work (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). More intensive, individualized interdisciplinary therapy programs should be considered, when available, for patients who have failed most other nonsurgical management strategies and who may be considering surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific occupational interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for surgery in patients with work-related low back pain should be no different than for patients with non-work-related low back pain although surgical outcomes may be worse for patients with disability compensation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals with occupational low back pain will improve, although back pain recurrence is common. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62074609\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Donald Krawciw, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hart LG, Deyo RA, Cherkin DC.
