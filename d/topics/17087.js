(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of AF is often based on a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) characterized by absence of discrete P waves and an irregularly irregular ventricular rate. In most patients, a single ECG is sufficient to secure the diagnosis, assuming the patient is in AF at the time of the ECG. In some patients it is also diagnosed using a heart rhythm recording such as a telemetry strip, Holter monitor, or an event monitor.</p><p>Occasionally, the electrocardiographic diagnosis of AF may be difficult.

Numerous micro-reentrant circuits within the atria generate multiple waves of impulses which often compete with or even extinguish each other. As a result, no uniform activation of the atrial tissue and no distinctive P waves are generated or recognized on the surface ECG. Since these multiple wavelets generate rapid and localized impulses, the sinus node is suppressed or not able to be expressed as it cannot activate the atrium. The mechanisms causing this pattern of electrical activity in the atria are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atrial electrical activation is rapid (generally greater than 350 to 360 beats per minute) and of various amplitudes, and occurs with irregularly irregular intervals. No discrete P waves are seen on the electrocardiogram. Instead, rapid, irregular, variable, and low amplitude oscillating fibrillatory (f) waves are observed between the QRS complexes. When the AF is of recent onset, the f waves are often coarse (&gt;2 mm); by comparison, the f waves are usually fine (&lt;1 mm) with AF of greater duration.</p><p>The f waves are of greater amplitude when there is hypertrophy of left atrial myocardium and become smaller with increasing atrial scarring and fibrosis. The amplitude of the fibrillatory waves does not correlate with the actual atrial size. &ldquo;Coarse&rdquo; AF in which the amplitude of the f waves is large (especially in lead V1) is more common in recent onset AF and can be confused with atrial flutter or multifocal atrial tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;, section on 'Definition, pathogenesis, and prevalence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter#H3238574069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiographic features'</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, there are no recognizable deflections of the baseline in any ECG lead (more common in longstanding AF) and AF is inferred because of the absence of P waves and the irregularly irregular ventricular rate. If present, f waves are best seen in the inferior leads and in V1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660456\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ventricular rate (especially in the absence of nodal blockade) usually ranges from 90 to 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. However, many factors determine the rate at any moment in any individual.</p><p>While the atrial rate is very rapid and depends upon the electrophysiologic characteristics of the atrial myocardium, the ventricular response rate is dependent upon the properties of the atrioventricular node (AV) and His Purkinje system. The irregularity of the ventricular response is the result of the irregular and rapid atrial rate and the degree of bombardment of the AV node with impulses, some of which occur in such rapid succession that they cannot conduct through the AV node due to refractoriness. The frequency of bombardment of the AV node can lengthen conduction time, and these impulses that reach the AV node but do not conduct are said to lead to concealed conduction within the AV node. The large number of atrial impulses arriving at the node compete with each other, interfering with their penetration into and through the node, leaving this tissue variably refractory. Irregular impulse conduction through the AV node to the ventricular myocardium via the His Purkinje system therefore results.</p><p>The ventricular rate in young individuals with untreated AF is generally 160 to 200 beats per minute, reflecting the maximal rate at which the AV node can conduct (as determined by its refractory period in lieu of concealed conduction). Increases in the ventricular response rate to over 200 beats per minute may occur if the refractory period of the AV node is shortened, as with sympathetic stimulation or an increase in circulating catecholamines or conduction down an accessory pathway if present. A decrease in the ventricular response rate occurs when the refractory period of the node is increased, as happens with aging. Other causes of a slower ventricular rate include intrinsic AV nodal disease in combination with sympathetic blockade, direct depression of the AV node with some drugs, or enhanced vagal tone.<br/></p><p>A regular ventricular rate, often referred to as &ldquo;regularization of atrial fibrillation,&rdquo; may infrequently occur despite a fibrillating atrium due to the complete blockade of AV nodal conduction and the subsequent development of a junctional (narrow QRS) or ventricular (wide QRS) escape rhythm. </p><p>Also, at very fast rates of conduction, the ventricular response rate can appear to be regular. In some cases, regularization in rate is due to conversion of AF into atrial flutter with a fixed ratio of conduction. Drugs that impair nodal conduction (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, beta or calcium channel blockers) or AV nodal disease may result in the development of slowing and regularization of the ventricular response. Digoxin is the most likely to do so. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;</a>.) Atrial flutter and fibrillation can coexist. </p><p>When AF is associated with a preexcitation syndrome (ie, the presence of an antegrade conduction accessory pathway), the ventricular response rate may be very rapid, often in excess of 280 to 300 beats per minute. This is because impulse conduction bypasses the atrioventricular node, as conduction from the atria to the ventricles occurs by an accessory or intranodal pathway. If the refractory period of this pathway is very short, impulse conduction can be very rapid. The tissue of accessory pathways does not have the same characteristics as the AV node and does not exhibit postrepolarization refractoriness and conducts rapidly as the tissue is not dependent on calcium conduction, but rather sodium conduction similar to atrial and ventricular muscle. In such cases, the QRS complex is usually aberrant (and wide) and may be confused with ventricular tachycardia, although the rhythm is still irregularly irregular. This rhythm may also be confused with AF with aberrancy; but with standard aberration, the morphology is more typical of a left or right bundle branch block. Conduction via an accessory pathway often shows a slurred QRS upstroke (see &ldquo;Delta&rdquo; wave), and this morphology depends on the location of the pathway and wherein inserts into the ventricular myocardium. During so-called preexcitation syndromes, conduction can proceed through the AV node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the accessory pathway. The more conduction proceeds through the accessory pathway, the more QRS appearance is &ldquo;aberrant.&rdquo; A distinguishing feature of this entity of AF with preexcitation is the relationship between heart rate and QRS duration; the faster the rate, the wider the QRS width. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULTIES IN DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the above findings usually allow the diagnosis of AF to be made easily, there are several pitfalls in correct identification of the rhythm.

These include multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP), multifocal atrial premature beats, and atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter with varying AV block. In general, distinct (although often abnormal and in, the case of MAT and WAP, variable) P (or flutter) waves are present in contrast to AF.

On the electrocardiogram, there are no apparent P waves. Further, for some patients who have ventricular pacing, an atrial lead may be present so that intracardiac electrograms can be used to determine the presence of atrial fibrillation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial flutter can present with a variable response rate and the ventricular response can be irregularly irregular. Additionally, frequent multiform PACs may present as an irregular response and appear to be atrial fibrillation. In some instances, short runs of atrial tachycardia can present as an irregular ventricular response rate similar to AF and the P waves may be absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have no obvious P waves and a slow ventricular rate, whether it is regular or irregular, may have complete heart block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates may be misdiagnosed as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. In such cases, patients are commonly treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, which will not convert patients with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AF with a wide QRS complex, as occurs in patients with either preexcitation or aberrancy, may make it difficult to determine if the rhythm is AF or ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H7983926\" class=\"local\">'Morphology of the QRS complex'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7983926\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology of the QRS complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The QRS complex usually maintains its normal narrow configuration in AF, since activation through the infranodal conduction system is intact. There are, however, settings in which widening of the QRS complex occurs. These include: a pre-existing conduction defect (left or right bundle branch block); functional (generally rate-related) block in a portion of the infranodal conduction system that results in asynchronous or aberrant activation and, for example, a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern; or preexcitation through an atrioventricular (AV) bypass tract which is capable of antegrade conduction. (See <a href=\"#H184127792\" class=\"local\">'AF with an AV bypass tract'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of aberrant conduction is a challenge. An aberrantly conducted beat due to a bundle branch block generally has the pattern of a classical bundle branch or fascicular block. The cycle length of the aberrant beat must be sufficiently short so that it finds one of the pathways refractory, usually the right bundle branch. In AF, however, some beats with identical cycle lengths may aberrate while others do not.</p><p>To understand why this might occur, it must be appreciated that the refractory period of the Purkinje cells of the bundle branches and fascicles is importantly determined by the preceding cycle length: A long preceding cycle lengthens and a short preceding cycle shortens the refractory period in these structures. A long-short cycle, then, predisposes to aberration. Using functional RBBB as an example, a long preceding cycle lengthens the refractory period in the right bundle branch, and the following short cycle introduces a beat that can traverse the left bundle branch but finds the right bundle refractory; the net effect is an ECG pattern of RBBB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59328\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef59328 \">waveform 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-intraventricular-block#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Intraventricular block&quot;, section on 'Right bundle branch block'</a>.)</p><p>Aberration following a long-short cycle in AF is often called the Ashman or Gouaux-Ashman phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If, on the other hand, there were a short preceding cycle, then the right bundle would not be refractory and normal conduction would occur. The initiation of aberration occurs with a long-short or more likely a short-long-short interval that leads to conduction block in one of the bundle branches, usually the right bundle, due to alterations of variations and refractoriness between the two bundles.&nbsp;Aberration can be in both bundles so that there is alternating bundle branch block and there can also be something called &ldquo;concealed perpetuated aberration.&rdquo;&nbsp;In this instance, the abnormal bundle branch block activation continues despite irregularity, even slowing in the ventricular response rate due to the fact that there is concealed retrograde penetration in the other bundle</p><p>This type of functional bundle branch block occurs most commonly in the right bundle branch. The left anterior fascicle is also frequently involved, often in combination with RBBB. In contrast, functional aberration is uncommon in the His bundle, the left posterior fascicle, or the main left bundle. Rarely, the functional aberration can be sustained by concealed conduction within the AV node. In this setting, atrial fibrillatory waves may not be seen and the ECG may have the appearance of a ventricular tachycardia.</p><p>Although functional bundle branch block is common in AF, premature ventricular beats are even more frequent. These beats generally do not have the morphology of a classic bundle branch or fascicular block and do not necessarily follow a pattern of a preceding long-short cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184127792\"><span class=\"h3\">AF with an AV bypass tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AF may develop in patients with an AV bypass tract that is capable of antegrade or atrioventricular conduction. In this situation, the QRS complex is a fusion beat between the area that is preexcited through the fast response bypass tract and the normal sequence of activation through the AV node. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-asynchronous-activation-and-preexcitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of asynchronous activation and preexcitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The electrophysiologic properties of activation and reactivation are such that very rapid atrioventricular transmission is possible, including the development of ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This may occur when normal conduction through the AV node and His-Purkinje system is blocked (such as occurs with an AV nodal blocking drug) and ventricular activation occurs only via the rapidly conducting accessory pathway, resulting in extremely rapid ventricular rates (that may be greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7983933\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of high degrees of AV nodal block and exit block on ventricular response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with high grade or third-degree block in the AV node (as may occur with digitalis toxicity or progressive AV nodal disease), impulses from the fibrillating atria fail to reach the infranodal conduction system. As a result, a pacemaker below the level of the block assumes control of the ventricles. The pacemaker is usually located in the AV junction above the bifurcation of the bundle branches, leading to a QRS complex that has the same morphology as if it had been conducted from the atria through the AV node. This pacemaker has a characteristic rate of about 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> unless it is accelerated or depressed due to pathology, ischemia, or drugs.</p><p>Less commonly, the pacemaker is subjunctional or ventricular. In this setting, the QRS complex will be wide and, unless accelerated, the ventricular rate will be relatively slow at 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>.</p><p>The ECG findings vary with the severity of AV block and with the possible presence of exit block below the pacemaker. As an example, the following sequence can be seen with increasing degrees of digitalis toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64396%7ECARD%2F76154%7ECARD%2F55119%7ECARD%2F66940\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64396 graphicRef76154 graphicRef55119 graphicRef66940 \">waveform 5A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high but not complete degree of AV block in AF will initially lead to single junctional, subjunctional, or ventricular escape beats with a cycle length characteristic of that pacemaker. These escape beats recur episodically during a rhythm strip; they can be diagnosed by the demonstration that the recurring longest R-R intervals have a constant cycle length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher degree of AV or third-degree block results in so few atrial impulses being conducted that the lower pacemaker takes over, leading to an escape junctional, subjunctional, or ventricular rhythm with a regular R-R interval for two or more cycles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, the lower pacemaker may be regular but there is a Wenckebach type of exit block, resulting in decreasing R-R intervals with group beating characteristic of the Wenckebach phenomenon.
