Over the next month, similar cases were reported from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By the end of the worldwide outbreak in July 2003, a total of 8096 cases were reported, with 774 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 9.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Termed &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; (SARS) by the WHO, initial efforts centered on tracking cases, determining an etiology, establishing a laboratory test for diagnosis, evaluating therapies, and implementing infection-control strategies to prevent further spread. The WHO spearheaded these efforts in collaboration with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health authorities from a number of countries, including particularly China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>A novel coronavirus was detected in specimens from a number of the patients with SARS, and very quickly the virus was sequenced and fulfilled Koch's postulates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Guidelines for surveillance, recognition, diagnosis, reporting, and public health management of this illness are available on the WHO and CDC websites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These sites should be consulted immediately whenever SARS is suspected, either as single cases or clusters. Moreover, with the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well as human cases of avian influenza, rapid reporting and investigation of otherwise unexplained severe acute respiratory illnesses have taken on a new urgency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza A H7N9: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The case definition, epidemiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of SARS will be reviewed here.

The WHO has issued an updated version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This definition recognizes that, in the absence of current SARS activity in humans, laboratory confirmation using reliable and experienced laboratories, such as those at the WHO and the CDC, is a critical component of the case definition.</p><p>According to the WHO, a case of SARS is notifiable if it occurs in an individual with laboratory confirmation of infection who <strong>either</strong> meets the clinical case definition <strong>or</strong> has worked in a laboratory with live SARS coronavirus or with clinical specimens infected with SARS coronavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The clinical case definition used by the WHO includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of fever or documented fever <strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath) <strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause <strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No alternative diagnosis fully explaining the illness</p><p/><p>Laboratory diagnostic tests that are required include one or both of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of virus by an assay for viral RNA (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) present in two separate samples or by virus culture from any clinical specimen.

Between November 16, 2002, and February 28, 2003, 792 cases were reported in this province [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Healthcare workers and their contacts appeared to be disproportionately affected by the outbreak.</p><p>The index case for the illness in Hong Kong was a physician from Guangdong Province who traveled to Hong Kong five days after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other cases in Hong Kong developed in those with contact with the index or secondary cases, including individuals staying at the same hotel as the index patient. The index cases in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Canada were in travelers returning from Guangdong Province or Hong Kong.</p><p>The illness had many epidemiologic and clinical features of an infection, and early efforts to find an associated pathogen quickly centered around a new viral strain from the coronavirus family, first identified in February and March 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The virus spread rapidly from southern China and Hong Kong to Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore, and then to Europe, Canada, and the United States.</p><p>Local epidemics in Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, and parts of China through March led the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue several travel advisories on or around April 1, 2003. These were combined with extraordinary efforts at containment through application of infection-control practices, particularly in hospitals. By July 2003, no new cases were reported worldwide and the WHO lifted its last remaining travel advisory.</p><p>During the remainder of 2003 and the first half of 2004, four small outbreaks of SARS were documented following the apparent end of the epidemic. Three outbreaks were related to laboratory transmission of the epidemic virus, and one was presumably from contact with animal sources. Since mid-2004, no cases have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate host and reservoir'</a> below.)</p><p>Most illnesses occurred in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Children 12 years or older had a clinical presentation similar to adults, whereas younger children had milder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. No fatal cases were reported among children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Scope of outbreak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2002 to 2003 outbreak resulted in 8096 cases with 774 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 9.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Older age was associated with a higher mortality rate, being as high as 43 percent in patients age 60 or older in Hong Kong compared with 13 percent in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Cases of SARS occurred in 29 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. China, including Hong Kong, had 83 percent of all cases. The United States had 27 probable cases with no secondary cases and no deaths. In Canada, mainly in Toronto, there were 251 cases (5 imported and the rest secondary) with 43 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The small outbreaks that followed the major SARS epidemic are of considerable interest as models of possible future SARS outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two outbreaks that presumably originated in laboratories working with the SARS coronavirus involved only a single case with no secondary spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In a third laboratory-based outbreak that occurred in China in April 2004, there were nine cases in three generations of contacts and one death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A fourth outbreak, in December 2003 and January 2004, consisted of four relatively mild and epidemiologically separate cases, all in Guangdong Province in southern China, and all presumably from contact with infected animals, probably palm civets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,24</a>].</p><p>These small outbreaks illustrate several important principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There must be strict control of laboratory strains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory strains, presumably because they represent strains that have been adapted to spread among humans, can cause outbreaks; in contrast, animal-derived strains are less likely to cause outbreaks without some period of adaptation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of possible animal intermediaries is important in preventing reemergence of SARS. Since 2004, China has banned all consumption of palm civets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermediate host and reservoir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animals eaten as exotic foods in southern China were probably intermediate hosts. The Chinese government launched an effort to kill palm civets, a cat-like creature considered a culinary delicacy in China that was sometimes infected by a coronavirus similar to the SARS coronavirus. A direct link between civets and SARS has not been confirmed, although molecular studies have suggested that SARS coronaviruses isolated early in the epidemic were closely related to palm civet coronaviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>Two studies demonstrated infection of a relatively high percentage of horseshoe bats (genus <em>Rhinolophus</em>) in China with viruses that have nucleotide sequences closely related to SARS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In a later study, the genomes of two novel bat coronaviruses from horseshoe bats in China were sequenced and found to resemble SARS coronavirus more than any previously identified bat coronavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, two replicating bat coronaviruses, SARS-like coronaviruses WIV1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and WIV16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], were isolated from <em>Rhinolophus sinica</em> feces in tissue culture. Both viruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from humans, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry; ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus. Studies of the sequences of the hypervariable open reading frame 8 have added further evidence of a close genetic relationship between certain <em>Rhinolophus </em>bat coronaviruses and the virus that caused the SARS epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These findings suggest that bats are likely to be an important reservoir for this virus. Moreover, coronaviruses resembling the SARS coronavirus, as well as others closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have been found in bats on several continents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology#H619339\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Bats'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the clusters of cases in Hong Kong and Canada, SARS coronavirus clearly spread from person to person and could be acquired from face-to-face contact, suggesting droplet spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/12,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,36-38</a>]. Because of the rapid and extensive spread of SARS in Hong Kong, there has also been speculation that other dissemination modes, such as fecal-oral or airborne spread, might occur. Airborne spread is the most likely explanation for &quot;superspreader&quot; events, including the small outbreak that occurred on an aircraft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and, possibly, the large, explosive outbreak in Amoy Gardens and surrounding residential building complexes in Hong Kong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Superspreaders are individuals who are responsible for a disproportionately large number of transmission events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Transmission to healthcare workers has been a common feature of most SARS outbreaks. A possible contributing factor is that peak viral shedding in respiratory secretions, as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), occurs 6 to 11 days following the onset of illness, at a time of severe respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This late viral excretion peak is unusual for a respiratory virus.</p><p>Fomites are another possible contributor to nosocomial transmission. SARS virus RNA is present in stool and was detected on a variety of hospital surfaces during outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This emphasizes the need for strict surface hygiene practices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that, after one or more instances of spread from animals to humans, the SARS coronavirus adapted through mutation, deletions, and possibly recombination, until it transmitted readily among humans. The virus that spread worldwide was derived primarily from a single infected individual who traveled from Guangdong Province to Hong Kong and infected numerous individuals in a superspreading event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The virus that was epidemic in China and produced the majority of probable infections was more variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/25,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period for SARS is usually two to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Approximately 95 percent of patients will develop symptoms within 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, after possible exposure, an individual should be monitored for the development of symptoms for at least 10 days. There is also an apparent association between more severe clinical manifestations and a shorter incubation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies have identified a number of risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with SARS.

A novel coronavirus was detected in specimens from a number of patients with SARS, and the virus was sequenced and fulfilled Koch's postulates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/5-7,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,50</a>]. Coronaviruses are usually agents of the common cold and generally do not cause severe respiratory disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronaviruses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronaviruses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Investigators at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a novel coronavirus in cell cultures inoculated with specimens from two patients in Thailand and Hong Kong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At the same time, coronaviruses were isolated from index cases in Germany and Hong Kong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Preliminary sequence analysis suggested that the viruses were similar and represented a previously undescribed coronavirus.</p><p>The SARS coronavirus genome has an organization similar to that of other coronaviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It has been classified as a lineage B beta-coronavirus (with several bat coronaviruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Through a variety of clinical, animal, and laboratory studies, the etiologic association between the SARS coronavirus and SARS has been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of the pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS coronavirus is limited.

Virus was consistently found in the lung and intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In fatal cases, virus was found in multiple organs, including the brain.</p><p>The adaptive immune system is probably critical to recovery from SARS, as demonstrated in experiments in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It is also likely that the innate immune system plays a role, both in defense against and in the pathogenesis of SARS. Genetic studies have pointed to the interleukin 12 receptor and the mannose-binding lectin as potential important first lines of defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L (L-SIGN) are functional receptors for SARS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. In an animal model, infection of ACE2 knockout mice led to recovery of low quantities of infectious virus compared with large amounts in the wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The authors of this report hypothesized that infection with SARS results in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent lung pathology, since ACE2 has a key protective role in acute lung injury. Several cellular proteolytic enzyme systems also facilitate entry of virus into the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SARS is an unusual respiratory viral disease since the prodrome is often somewhat prolonged, lasting for three to seven days, and is characterized by fever (temperature &ge;100.5&ordm;F [&gt;38&ordm;C]) malaise, headache, and myalgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Unlike virtually all other respiratory viral prodromes, most patients have no upper respiratory symptoms during this stage. At the end of this prodrome, the respiratory phase typically begins with a nonproductive cough. Dyspnea may follow and may progress to respiratory failure, with progressive pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, necessitating mechanical ventilation.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the clinical manifestations associated with SARS summarizes data from 752 patients from mainland China (190 cases), Hong Kong (388 cases), Canada (154 cases), and Singapore (20 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

One of the characteristics of the infection, namely the low contagiousness of patients during the prodrome, probably contributed to the success of control efforts, since patients could, in the outbreak situation, be identified and placed on precautions before they became most infectious to contacts. But the disappearance of SARS in July 2003, only nine months after it had first been detected, was a substantial international public health accomplishment. Isolation of patients, rigorous use of masks, gloves, and gowns, closure of schools, hospitals, and clubs, and quarantine of exposed individuals probably all contributed to containment of the outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].</p><p>Details of recommended hospital, community, and home precautionary measures are available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through their website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efforts are underway to prepare a vaccine for the prevention of SARS, and a large number of candidate vaccines have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Most efforts have concentrated on developing antibody (either secretory or systemic, or both) to the surface S glycoprotein, since neutralizing antibody is directed against the receptor-binding portion of this molecule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74041\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74041 \">figure 1</a>). There is controversy regarding the potential inclusion of the M protein as a component of a vaccine. Although the M protein is an immunodominant protein and may be important as a target of cell-mediated immunity, there is disagreement about its capacity to induce neutralizing antibody and therefore its importance as an antigen in a preventive vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>].
