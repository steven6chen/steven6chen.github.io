It is most common in newborns who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are born more than 8 weeks early (this is called &quot;preterm&quot; or &quot;premature&quot; birth). A normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, so babies born at 32 weeks or less are more likely to have this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborns who weigh about 3 pounds or less. This is less than half the weight of an average newborn.</p><p/><p>Babies who are born very premature need to stay in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, or &quot;NICU.&quot; This is so doctors and nurses can watch them closely and take care of them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7554926\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some newborns have no symptoms. A baby that has symptoms might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be more sleepy or less alert than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have weak, floppy muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move less than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop breathing for short periods of time</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7554940\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can test for this condition with an ultrasound of the baby's head. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body. Ultrasounds are usually done on all babies who are born more than 8 weeks early. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7554955\"><span class=\"h1\">How is intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no treatments to stop the bleeding. But your baby's doctor will check to make sure your baby's blood flow and oxygen levels are normal. This can prevent further bleeding.</p><p>Your baby might need fluids given through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; He or she might also need oxygen, which is given through:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 plastic tubes put in the baby's nostrils</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mask over the baby's mouth and nose in a treatment called &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; or &quot;CPAP&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breathing tube &ndash; This is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a ventilator (breathing machine).</p><p/><p>Some babies with intraventricular hemorrhage have no long-term effects, while others have problems with their development. Babies with a lot of bleeding in the brain are more likely to have problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7554970\"><span class=\"h1\">Can intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce the chance that your baby will have an intraventricular hemorrhage by going to all your doctor or midwife's visits when you are pregnant and following their advice. This will lower the chances that you will have a baby that is born too early.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2785058993\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
