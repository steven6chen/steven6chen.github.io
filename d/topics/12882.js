It is called the &quot;master gland&quot; because it controls all the other glands in the body.</p><p>The pituitary gland makes many different hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that turn on and off different processes in the body. Here is a list of some of the hormones made by the pituitary gland and an explanation of what those hormones do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticotropin (also called &quot;ACTH&quot;) &ndash; Corticotropin tells the adrenal glands to release a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control how the body uses sugar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (called &quot;TSH&quot;) &ndash; TSH tells the thyroid gland to release hormones called &quot;T3&quot; and &quot;T4.&quot; These hormones control how the body uses and stores energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonadotropins &ndash; In women, gonadotropins tell the ovaries to release the hormones estrogen and progesterone. They also tell the ovaries to prepare and release eggs. In men, these hormones tell the testicles to make testosterone and sperm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone &ndash; Growth hormone helps children grow to a normal height. In adults, it helps keep the right balance of fat and muscle in the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolactin &ndash; Prolactin helps control the development of breasts in girls. It also tells the breasts to make milk after a woman gives birth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133084\"><span class=\"h1\">What is panhypopituitarism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Panhypopituitarism is the medical term for when the pituitary gland does not make enough of the hormones it is supposed to make. This can happen when the pituitary gland is damaged or when there is a problem higher in the brain (in the part called the &quot;hypothalamus&quot;). The pituitary gland can be damaged by abnormal growths that sometimes form on the gland. Or it can be damaged by the treatment used to control those abnormal growths, such as surgery or radiation. Some people are born without one or more of the pituitary hormones.</p><p>When the pituitary gland does not make enough of its hormones, the other glands that the pituitary gland controls also do not make enough of the hormones they are supposed to make. This can cause serious problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133099\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of panhypopituitarism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different, depending on which hormones are most affected by the disorder. In general, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being bothered by the cold</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having less interest in sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble getting pregnant or getting a woman pregnant (called infertility)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Irregular or missed periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of pubic hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being unable to make milk for breastfeeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased facial or body hair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Testicles that have shrunk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being shorter than other children of the same age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133115\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if your doctor suspects you have panhypopituitarism, you will need blood tests to check for different hormone levels. You might also need an imaging test, such as an MRI. These tests can create a picture of the inside of your body. They can show if there is something pressing on or damaging your pituitary gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133130\"><span class=\"h1\">How is panhypopituitarism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually involves taking hormone medicines to replace the hormones the body is missing. People who are treated for panhypopituitarism usually must take these medicines for the rest of their life. Often, they also need to have regular blood tests to check their hormone levels.</p><p>People who have a tumor or growth on their pituitary gland might also need surgery or other treatments (such as radiation therapy) to remove or destroy the tumor or growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133145\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have children, mention that to your doctor or nurse. Parts of your treatment might need to be different while you are trying to have a baby. For example, you might need to get treated with certain hormones that make it possible for a woman to get pregnant and for a man to make a woman pregnant. With the right treatment, most men and women with panhypopituitarism can have children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676133160\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=addisons-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Addison's disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolactinoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prolactinoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-adenoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pituitary adenoma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-prolactin-levels-and-prolactinomas-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
