Currently, no medicines can cure Parkinson disease or keep it from getting worse over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12567027\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I take?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can use different medicines to treat Parkinson disease. People might take one or more of these medicines. The right medicines for you will depend on your symptoms, your age, and how active you are.</p><p>People do not always take medicines for their Parkinson disease right away. That's because even though the medicines can help, they might cause problems of their own. Many people start taking medicines when their symptoms affect their daily activities. To decide when you should start, talk with your family and your doctor. Ask your doctor about the benefits and side effects of the different medicines.</p><p>When you start taking medicines, your doctor will work with you to find the medicines and doses that work best. Let him or her know if you have any side effects or problems with the medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This article has basic information on the main medicines used to treat Parkinson disease, and mentions only some of the side effects of these medicines. For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12567062\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines to treat Parkinson disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main medicines used to treat Parkinson disease are levodopa and dopamine agonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665325\"><span class=\"h2\">Levodopa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levodopa, or &quot;L-dopa,&quot; can help people who have trouble moving the body. It can also improve stiffness and tremors. Doctors usually prescribe it first, because it is the medicine that works best for most people. Levodopa comes in different forms, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> (brand names: Sinemet, Parcopa) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levodopa-and-benserazide-united-states-not-available-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levodopa-benserazide</a> (brand names: Madopar, Prolopa).</p><p>The most common short-term side effects are nausea, headache, feeling dizzy, and feeling sleepy. These problems are not usually serious. Serious side effects can happen, especially in older people, but they are less common. These can include losing touch with reality and believing things that aren't really true (called &quot;delusions&quot;). To prevent problems with side effects, your doctor will work with you to find the lowest dose and best time of day to take each dose.</p><p>When people with Parkinson disease first start taking levodopa, it usually works well with each dose. However, up to one-half of people who take levodopa for several years can start having problems called &quot;motor fluctuations&quot; and &quot;dyskinesia.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Motor fluctuations&quot; happen when the effect of levodopa starts to wear off too soon, or wears off suddenly. This problem often happens without warning. It causes the symptoms of Parkinson disease to get much worse. For example, people with this problem might suddenly find it hard to move or walk, at least for a short time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dyskinesia&quot; is the name for different kinds of abnormal movements that people can't control. These movements can affect different parts of the body. They are usually jerky or twisting movements. Sometimes they are more like a cramp that makes the foot or the neck turn and pull.</p><p/><p>If you have any of these problems while taking levodopa, talk to your doctor. He or she might need to change your dose, or add another medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665331\"><span class=\"h2\">Dopamine agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medicines control symptoms almost as well as levodopa, but they can cause similar side effects. Side effects can include nausea, feeling tired, and delusions (believing things that aren't really true). These medicines might also cause leg swelling. Dopamine agonists include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pramipexole</a> (brand name: Mirapex), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ropinirole</a> (brand name: Requip), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rotigotine</a> (brand name: Neupro), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bromocriptine</a> (brand names: Parlodel, Cycloset), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apomorphine</a> (brand name: Apokyn).</p><p>Dopamine agonists are usually used along with levodopa for people who have severe Parkinson disease.</p><p>In other cases, doctors sometimes prescribe dopamine agonists first for people younger than 65. so they can put off taking levodopa. That way, they might avoid or delay getting the movement problems mentioned above that can affect people who take levodopa for several years. But it is not clear if taking dopamine agonists instead of levodopa actually lowers the risk of getting these problems. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665338\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other medicines for Parkinson disease include MAO B inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, anticholinergics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amantadine</a>. They are used less often than levodopa and dopamine agonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665344\"><span class=\"h3\">MAO B inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAO B inhibitors are long-lasting medicines that help somewhat to reduce symptoms. Side effects can include nausea, headache, confusion, and trouble falling asleep.</p><p>MAO B inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">selegiline</a> (sample brand names: Eldepryl, Emsam), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rasagiline</a> (brand name: Azilect), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safinamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">safinamide</a> (brand name: Xadago).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665357\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticholinergics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medicines can help control tremors. They are often used in younger people who have a tremor as their most severe symptom. Older people are more likely to get side effects, including dizziness, confusion, dry mouth, blurry vision, nausea, and trouble urinating or having bowel movements.</p><p>Anticholinergics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">trihexyphenidyl</a> (sample brand names: Artane, Trihexy), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">benztropine</a> (brand name: Cogentin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orphenadrine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">orphenadrine</a> (brand name: Norflex).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665369\"><span class=\"h3\">Amantadine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Amantadine</a> (brand name: Symmetrel) can help improve mild symptoms of tremor, stiffness, and trouble moving the body. It may also help with dyskinesia (abnormal movements). Side effects can include hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't really there), confusion, ankle swelling, and skin changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17665375\"><span class=\"h3\">COMT inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COMT inhibitors are medicines taken with levodopa that help levodopa work longer and better. They are mainly used to treat patients whose levodopa &quot;wears off&quot; before the next dose. Side effects can include confusion, nausea, diarrhea, and abnormal movements.</p><p>COMT inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolcapone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tolcapone</a> (brand name: Tasmar) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entacapone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">entacapone</a> (brand name: Comtan).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12567105\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Parkinson disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; medications (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-education-support-and-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; education, support, and therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
