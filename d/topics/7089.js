As such, it is prone to stress injury at several locations. Stress injury (including stress reaction and stress fracture) denotes gradual structural compromise (from edema to frank cortical fracture) due to training overload. Stress fractures may be incomplete or complete, and either non-displaced or displaced. Femoral neck stress fractures are considered high-risk for complications, particularly displacement; whereas, femoral shaft stress fractures are low-risk.</p><p>This topic is focused on overuse stress injury of the femur in physically active individuals, and will discuss patterns of femoral stress fractures (both epidemiologic and patho-anatomic), examination findings, radiographic assessment, and treatment. Insufficiency fractures in older adult patients, acute traumatic femur fractures, and stress fractures generally are reviewed separately.

In case series, they comprise between 1 and 25 percent of all stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. While the exact overall incidence is not known, the observational studies reporting a higher incidence likely include more athletes participating in distance running. While smaller series report that FSF are more common in military trainees than athletes (as a percentage of stress fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], studies with larger numbers show comparable rates in both groups (ranging from 1 to 7 percent of all stress fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In most studies, femoral neck injuries are more common than femoral shaft stress fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], although this finding is not consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Overuse FSF have been diagnosed in patients from age five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] to physically active adults in their 50s and 60s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. The large majority of published studies involve athletes and military recruits in their late teens and early 20s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and most subjects are male.</p><p>FSF are most commonly associated with running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10</a>]. A systematic review of the risks for femoral stress fractures identified two well-established factors: female gender and previous history of stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Female athletes and female military recruits are thought to be at higher risk for FSF due to lower body mass and lower bone mineral density than males. Those with amenorrhea or poor aerobic fitness prior to starting military training are at particular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. FSF also occur in those who are overweight with limited participation in sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of other factors have been associated with stress fractures generally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79279 \">table 1</a>). Although not all of these are specifically associated with femoral stress fractures, many are worthy of attention, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low level of physical fitness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden increases in the volume and intensity of physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet poor in calcium; poor bone health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor biomechanics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>)</p><p/><p>While evidence remains limited, some experienced clinicians consider dynamic femoral anteversion and genu valgus to be additional biomechanical risk factors for femoral neck stress fracture. Leg length inequality, which is associated with recurrent stress fracture at other sites (eg, tibia, fibula, metatarsal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], has been implicated in hip and pelvis fractures in multiple case reports. If leg length inequality results in an abnormal running gait, the resulting increase in the load placed on the hip is likely to increase stress across the femoral neck and the risk of stress fracture. Leg length inequality has been described as mild when less than 3 cm but may have biomechanical consequences in athletes such as runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316712245\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common femoral stress fractures (FSF) involve the femoral neck and the proximal femoral shaft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105268 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105269\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105269 \">figure 2</a>). Other FSF that have been described (in order of decreasing frequency) include injuries to the distal femoral shaft, supracondylar and condylar regions, and femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,20</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral neck stress fractures may occur on the superolateral (tension side) or inferomedial aspect (compression side) of the femoral neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105392 \">figure 3</a>). The former are considered high-risk stress fractures, as the risk for complications is greater. The tenuous blood supply to the femoral head is a key factor in the relatively high risk for complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74955 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59744 \">figure 5</a>). This is discussed separately.

The fracture is associated with coxa vara (a decreased medial angle between the femoral head and shaft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59633\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59633 \">figure 6</a>)), but this is not a consistent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral shaft stress fractures occur most often at the proximal posteromedial cortex. This is the location for the insertion of the adductor brevis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98417 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105272\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105272 \">figure 8</a>) and the origin of the vastus medialis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105275 \">figure 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105270\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105270 \">figure 10</a>). The repetitive forces exerted against the femur when these muscles contract may play a role in the development of these fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,20,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal femoral shaft stress fractures are less common but can be seen medially or laterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress fractures of the supracondylar and condylar regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>], femoral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], and lesser trochanter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] have been described but are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67730704\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overuse stress fractures, regardless of location, share a common underlying mechanism of injury. Local bone metabolism becomes imbalanced due to the stress of repeated workloads, and bone formation cannot compensate adequately for increased bone resorption. This causes bone edema and micro-fracture. These may in turn propagate and create frank cortical disruption (lucent lines on plain radiograph). This pathologic process can result in complete (trans-cortical) and even displaced fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31</a>]. Muscle fatigue may contribute to this process. If muscle functioning is impaired from fatigue, its protective role in controlling motion and decreasing shock with impact is lost, thereby imparting greater stress to bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67730710\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316712378\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overuse femoral stress fractures (FSF) of all types result from over-training, most often running. The patient may give a history of training of long duration (eg, distance running over many months or years), a recent increase in training volume or intensity, or a change in the type of training (eg, addition of hill runs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. FSF are most common in athletes and military trainees. Females and those with low body mass index are at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. Clinicians should inquire about amenorrhea and any history of stress fracture, which are associated with increased risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to inquire about medication use, as several drugs are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, although not specifically with femoral stress fractures. These medications include glucocorticoids, bisphosphonates, and proton pump inhibitors, when these are used chronically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common presentations for particular injury types include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral neck stress fractures typically present with vague anterior groin pain that develops or worsens with exercise or prolonged standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Runners preparing for a marathon commonly develop such pain during the training phase that involves runs longer than two hours. More experienced runners often experience such pain when they attempt to run back-to-back marathons with insufficient recovery time between races.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral shaft stress fractures present with deep aching pain in the thigh. While not focal, pain most often develops in the medial portion of the proximal third of the thigh. Pain increases with activity and may radiate to or even predominate in the knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal femoral stress fractures are more likely to elicit complaints of tenderness over the distal femur or pain that radiates into the knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With either type of fracture, the patient cannot tolerate high-impact activities such as running [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>].</p><p/><p>Although FSF are uncommon, clinicians should be aware of these conditions because delayed diagnosis of femoral neck injuries can lead to permanent disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H67730866\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316712407\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a femoral stress injury may demonstrate an antalgic gait. Due to the muscle bulk around the femoral neck and shaft, it is difficult to palpate a stress fracture in these locations. Because of this difficulty, and because FSF are uncommon, there is frequently a delay in diagnosis of several weeks or more, which increases the risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>].</p><p>Patients with a femoral neck stress fracture may experience pain when the hip is placed at the end-points of its range of motion (eg, full internal rotation), or less commonly hip motion may be restricted, particularly internal and external rotation or flexion (especially if the fracture has displaced). Femoral shaft stress fractures typically allow normal hip motion, but resisted hip flexion or knee extension (and possibly resisted hip adduction) may elicit pain.</p><p>Special tests for particular injuries include the hop test and the fulcrum test. The hop test is thought to be a sensitive but non-specific maneuver for identifying lower extremity stress injuries, including femoral neck stress fractures. The patient is instructed to hop repeatedly on the symptomatic leg. Inability to perform repeated hops or worsening groin pain marks a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10</a>]. The hop test may also be used to help assess femoral shaft stress fractures. With these injuries, pain experienced while hopping localizes to the thigh rather than the groin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The fulcrum test is used to assess possible stress fracture of the femoral shaft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,36,37</a>]. In this test, the patient sits at the edge of an exam table and the examiner places one of their forearms, radius side up, under the painful thigh of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98475 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105475\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105475 \">movie 1</a>). Then the examiner pushes down on the patient's knee with their free hand. The test is repeated as the examiner moves the &quot;fulcrum&quot; arm proximally along the underside of the patient's thigh and repeats downward pressure at the knee. Pain and reproduction of the patient's symptoms suggest a femoral shaft stress injury at the site of pain. Although not rigorously studied, the fulcrum test is thought by many sports medicine specialists to be a useful and accurate technique for identifying femoral shaft stress injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,20,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,20,38</a>].</p><p>Distal femoral stress fractures (ie, supracondylar and condylar injuries) are uncommon and manifest point tenderness at the site of injury. Although such fractures can cause referred pain at the knee, the knee joint examination is unremarkable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316712884\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs, including standard views of the hip, femur, and knee, are the first studies obtained when a femoral stress fracture (FSF) is suspected. When pain is limited to the groin, knee studies are typically not necessary. If plain radiographs demonstrate a stress fracture, the diagnosis is made and no further imaging is necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105425\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105425 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. However, plain radiographs of a FSF are usually normal for approximately three to four weeks following the start of symptoms, and a femoral stress reaction may cause symptoms for long periods without visible pathology on a plain radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,7,22,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,22,39,40</a>]. Therefore, normal plain radiographs cannot definitively rule out a femoral stress injury.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the study of choice when definitive diagnosis of a FSF is required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105421\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105421 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105424\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105424 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105423\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105423 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/29,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,41,42</a>]. A systematic review reported the sensitivity of MRI for lower extremity stress fracture to range from 68 to 99 percent, which was superior to any other modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Reported specificities varied widely among studies. Imaging shows that most FSF are transverse, but longitudinal stress injuries can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Although nuclear scintigraphy (bone scan) has been used in many of the studies of FSF, the radiation exposure entailed and the increasing availability and decreasing cost of MRI have made this modality largely obsolete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4,7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,22</a>].</p><p>Anecdotal reports suggest that ultrasound may be useful for diagnosis in select patients (eg, thin distance runners), but there is no high quality evidence supporting this approach and further study is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316712710\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis of a femoral stress fracture (FSF) is made by imaging study, usually plain radiograph or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Initial clinical suspicion for the diagnosis is based on the history, which generally involves a recent increase in training volume or intensity, most often in runners or military recruits, and suggestive physical findings, such as positive hop and fulcrum tests. However, the history may be limited and examination findings unclear. Plain radiographs are often non-diagnostic, particularly during the early stages of injury. Often, MRI is required to establish the diagnosis and to distinguish between stress fractures of the proximal shaft and the femoral neck.

Such conditions often manifest some mechanical component (eg, catching, locking, blocking), whereas femoral neck fractures generally do not. When a definitive diagnosis must be made, magnetic resonance imaging can be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hip flexor tendon injury</strong>: Patients with tendinitis or tendinopathy involving the proximal rectus femoris tendon generally have reproducible point tenderness at the tendon origin at the anterior inferior iliac spine, and pain is exacerbated by flexing the muscle against resistance. Less commonly, pain arises deep in the upper thigh at the attachment of the reflected head of quadriceps (rectus) femoris. Hip flexor injuries involving the iliopsoas tendon (which are common among dancers) may cause pain more localized to the upper medial thigh, mimicking the pain of a femoral shaft stress fracture. The hop test can help distinguish between tendon injuries and fractures, as initiating the hop causes pain but landing does not with tendon injuries. When a definitive diagnosis must be made, magnetic resonance imaging can be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hip osteoarthritis</strong> (OA) and <strong>femoral head avascular necrosis</strong> (AVN): The insidious onset and characteristics of pain associated with hip OA and AVN are similar to those of femoral neck stress fractures, but imaging studies distinguish the two conditions. On examination, hip motion typically shows greater limitations with OA or AVN compared with a femoral neck stress fracture. If plain radiographs are insufficient, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Complete non-displaced tension side fractures are also treated surgically on an urgent basis. Following surgery, the patient is typically non-weight-bearing for six weeks, followed by protected-weight-bearing for six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7,13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,13,33</a>].</p><p>Debate is ongoing about the best treatment for incomplete tension side femoral neck stress fractures without displacement. Most orthopedic surgeons in the United States recommend surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. For athletes who desire to return to sport as quickly as possible and for any patient for whom compliance is in question, we suggest surgical treatment, assuming the patient is willing to accept the risks associated with surgery (eg, infection). However, in the large majority of cases, non-displaced tension side fractures heal completely with non-surgical management involving strict non-weight-bearing. This has been shown in multiple observational studies with large numbers of patients and lengthy follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/21,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,48</a>]. Before determining treatment, the patient and clinician should discuss the relative risks and benefits of each approach.</p><p>If the patient elects non-surgical management, institute bed rest for one to two weeks followed by strict non-weight-bearing with crutches for an additional four to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/femoral-stress-fractures-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Weekly plain radiographs should be obtained for the first four to six weeks to monitor fracture healing and position, followed by bimonthly radiographs until 12 weeks out from initiation of treatment. Should radiographs show displacement or extension of the fracture, or inadequate healing, the patient should be referred to an orthopedist, as surgery is likely to be necessary.

Complications included delayed- or non-union, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, shortening of the femoral neck, and early-onset osteoarthritis.

The incidence is increased among those with a history of stress fracture and females. Other risk factors include poor physical fitness, sudden increases in training volume or intensity, and poor bone health. (See <a href=\"#H67730649\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral neck stress fractures may occur on the superolateral (tension side) or inferomedial aspect (compression side) of the femoral neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F105392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105392 \">figure 3</a>). The former are considered high-risk stress fractures, as the risk for complications is greater. Femoral shaft stress fractures occur most often at the proximal posteromedial cortex. Femoral stress fractures occur when bone formation cannot compensate adequately for increased bone resorption due to the stress of repeated workloads. (See <a href=\"#H316712245\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H67730704\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with overuse femoral stress fractures give a history of training of long duration (eg, distance running over many months or years), a recent increase in training volume or intensity, or a recent change in the type of training (eg, addition of hill runs). Patients with a femoral stress injury may demonstrate an antalgic gait. Those with a femoral neck stress fracture may experience pain when the hip is placed at the end-points of its range of motion (eg, full internal rotation), while those with a femoral shaft stress fracture demonstrate normal hip motion, but resisted hip flexion or knee extension (and possibly resisted hip adduction) may elicit pain. Special tests for particular injuries include the hop test and the fulcrum test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98475 \">picture 1</a>), which are described in the text.

When pain is limited to the groin, knee studies are typically not necessary. If plain radiographs demonstrate a stress fracture, the diagnosis is made and no further imaging is necessary. However, plain radiographs are usually normal for approximately three to four weeks following the start of symptoms, and a femoral stress reaction may cause symptoms for long periods without visible pathology on a plain radiograph. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the study of choice when definitive diagnosis is required.

(See <a href=\"#H67730819\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is reasonable clinical suspicion for a femoral stress fracture, the patient should be non-weight-bearing on the affected extremity until the diagnosis is determined. Further treatment depends upon the location and type of fracture. Fractures at high risk of complications (eg, tension-side femoral neck stress fracture) are generally treated surgically. Treatment for the common types of femoral stress fractures amenable to non-surgical management, including basic rehabilitation programs, is described in the text. As part of management, predisposing risk factors (eg, low vitamin D, low bone density, inadequate muscle strength, poor running mechanics) should be addressed as indicated. (See <a href=\"#H67730830\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the different types of femoral stress fractures, the risk of significant complication is greatest for displaced femoral neck fractures. Potential complications include delayed- or non-union, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, shortening of the femoral neck, and early-onset osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"#H67730866\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Thompson JC.
