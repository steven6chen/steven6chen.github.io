They are hyperplastic overgrowths of endometrial glands and stroma that form a projection from the surface of the endometrium (lining of the uterus). They may also be asymptomatic. The great majority of endometrial polyps are benign, but malignancy occurs in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of endometrial polyps are reviewed here. General principles of the evaluation of uterine bleeding are discussed separately.

Smooth muscle is sometimes present. </p><p>Single or multiple polyps may occur and range in diameter from a few millimeters to several centimeters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51898 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Polyps can develop anywhere in the uterine cavity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348450\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to play a role in the development of endometrial polyps. These include monoclonal endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], overexpression of endometrial aromatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and gene mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Like uterine leiomyomas, polyps have characteristic cytogenetic rearrangements. Rearrangements in the high-mobility group (HMG) family of transcription factors appear to play a pathogenic role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>].</p><p>Endometrial polyps express both estrogen and progesterone receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In polyps, as in normal endometrial tissue, progesterone may serve an antiproliferative function. This has been demonstrated in a subset of women with polyps, ie, those on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While androgens have been found to cause endometrial atrophy, similar to progestins, data suggest that testosterone does not substitute for progestational activity for polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348583\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial polyps are rare among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The frequency of polyps is difficult to establish, since there are few data and some polyps are asymptomatic. Among clinically recognized polyps, the prevalence appears to rise steadily with increasing age, and to be higher in premenopausal than postmenopausal women (6 versus 12 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among women undergoing endometrial biopsy or hysterectomy, the prevalence of endometrial polyps is 10 to 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350511\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial polyps express both estrogen and progesterone receptors, although studies differ on whether these appear to have pathogenic importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>].

Many polyps are asymptomatic and are discovered as the result of an evaluation for infertility, a finding of endometrial cells on cervical cytology, or as an incidental finding on endometrial sampling, pelvic imaging, or hysteroscopy. In some women, prolapse of the polyp occurs and it can be visualized at the external cervical os during pelvic examination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348945\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal uterine bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal uterine bleeding , which is usually described by the patient as vaginal bleeding, is the most common presenting symptom and occurs in 64 to 88 percent of women with polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/17,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,33,34</a>]. Bleeding due to polyps is referred to as AUB-P in the nomenclature recommended by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Intermenstrual bleeding is the most frequent symptom in premenopausal women with endometrial polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The volume of bleeding is usually small, and may be just spotting. Some women experience heavier bleeding between menstrual cycles. Postmenopausal bleeding is another common presentation; some postmenopausal women with polyps have breakthrough bleeding during hormonal therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with abnormal uterine bleeding require evaluation for endometrial cancer.

Studies have shown an association between the finding of benign endometrial cells on liquid cervical cytology testing and both benign and malignant endometrial neoplasms. In a large retrospective chart review of women age 40 years or older with a cervical cytology report that included the presence of endometrial cells and underwent endometrial sampling, 12 percent of women had endometrial polyps alone and 2 percent had polyps with a coexistent diagnosis (ie, hyperplasia or endometritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Among the women with polyps alone, 72 percent were asymptomatic. The evaluation of endometrial cells on cervical cytology is discussed separately.

A prolapsed polyp can be visualized during a speculum examination, typically as a globular, friable, pedunculated lesion protruding from the external cervical os. </p><p>A polypoid lesion at the external cervical os is most commonly a cervical polyp, but may be a prolapsed endometrial polyp or leiomyoma. In general, a cervical polyp is identified by visualizing or palpating a stalk originating from the endocervical canal, while the stalk of an endometrial polyp originates from the uterine cavity. Prolapsed leiomyomas typically have a firm consistency, while polyps are soft and friable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;, section on 'Polyps'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid#H735961\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prolapsed uterine leiomyoma (fibroid)&quot;, section on 'Incidental finding on pelvic examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349427\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic ultrasound and hysteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first line imaging study of choice of evaluation of women with abnormal uterine bleeding. This modality is effective at characterizing uterine and adnexal lesions and is less expensive than other modalities. </p><p>For women with an uncertain finding on ultrasound alone, who are postmenopausal, or who are candidates for expectant management, we suggest sonohysterography, also referred to as saline infusion sonogram (SIS) or diagnostic hysteroscopy. A systematic review of over 5000 women reported a similar performance for the diagnosis of polyps for all three modalities: sensitivity (TVUS: 91 percent; SIS: 95 percent; hysteroscopy: 90 percent) and specificity (90 and 92 and 93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Both SIS and hysteroscopy give a better sense of the shape of the lesion than TVUS alone. The advantage of SIS compared with hysteroscopy is that the adnexa are also visualized, so this modality is useful in women with suspected adnexal pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70574\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70574 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74624 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54170\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54170 \">image 3</a>). On the other hand, diagnostic hysteroscopy allows direct visualization of the lesion.

Histologic evaluation can also exclude malignancy. </p><p>The specimen is usually collected at time of polypectomy. In some women, an endometrial polyp is diagnosed on an office endometrial biopsy performed to evaluate abnormal uterine bleeding. In such cases, polypectomy should still be performed if indicated (for symptom relief or to exclude malignancy), since the entire polyp may not have been removed with the endometrial biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H10071598\" class=\"local\">'Polypectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>An RCT in postmenopausal women with bleeding and thickened endometrium and a negative endometrial biopsy demonstrated that 3 percent of women had undiagnosed endometrial cancer and 3 percent had endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The authors concluded that either hysteroscopy or SIS to look for structural lesions in postmenopausal women is warranted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351461\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of an endometrial polyp includes other structural lesions of the uterine cavity, primarily intracavitary leiomyomas. It is usually, but not always, possible to differentiate between these lesions with sonography. In addition, polyps and fibroids typically have different appearances when visualized with hysteroscopy. Polyps often have a beefy red appearance, and are usually thinner and less likely to be sessile. In addition, they are soft and friable when touched with an instrument. In contrast, myomas are firm and are mainly white in color with surface blood vessels. The final determination is made with histology.

At hysteroscopy, polyps are generally well-demarcated, in contrast with endometrial neoplasia.

Seven women had polyps on the first examination. Four of these women had spontaneous regression of their polyps at the second scan, while seven women developed new polyps over the 2.5-year interval. Polyps larger than 1 cm were least likely to regress. Hormone use did not appear to affect the natural history of the polyps, but the study sample was small. A second study of 112 women managed for a mean of 22.5 months found that only 6.3 percent of polyps spontaneously regressed and that no factors were reliably associated with polyp growth and regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 95 percent of endometrial polyps are benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In our practice, we don&rsquo;t perform further surveillance in these patients. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1501259\"><span class=\"h4\">Infertile women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data regarding the impact of removal of an endometrial polyp on fertility are limited, as discussed above. Current evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation, although most clinicians perform polypectomy in infertile women. (See <a href=\"#H349191\" class=\"local\">'Effect on fertility and pregnancy'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10071254\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For postmenopausal women, we recommend removal of all endometrial polyps. The risk of malignancy in a polyp is highest in postmenopausal women and the risk of complications associated with polypectomy is low. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10071598\" class=\"local\">'Polypectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1501288\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with recurrent polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases, endometrial polyps recur after removal. In such cases, care should be taken to completely remove the polyp(s) in a repeat polypectomy procedure. There are no data regarding management of recurrent endometrial polyps. One option is a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, given its reported efficacy in women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Endometrial ablation is also an option for women who have completed their childbearing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421035\"><span class=\"h2\">Women on tamoxifen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of the 20 mcg per day levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (Mirena; LNg20 IUD) decreases the incidence of endometrial polyps in women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. However, further study is needed to determine whether such treatment results in a decrease in endometrial carcinoma in general or malignant transformation in polyps and whether use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>, particularly in women with progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. A decrease in the incidence of polyps in women on tamoxifen has been demonstrated in two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The trial with the longest follow-up included pre- and postmenopausal women with mostly stage I or II breast cancer on tamoxifen (n = 113) and found that use of the LNg20 IUD compared with no treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the rate of polyps at one (2 versus 16 percent) and five years (4 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/14,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,54</a>]. Hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling was performed at 12, 24, 45, and 60 months. All polyps were removed upon detection and were benign; the authors noted that the prompt removal of polyps in the study may have masked the risk of malignant transformation (up to 11 percent in women on tamoxifen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]). There were no cases of endometrial carcinoma and no significant difference in the rate of endometrial hyperplasia between the two groups at five years, but there were few events (0 of 58 women in the LNg20 group; 1 of 60 in the control group). No difference in the breast cancer recurrence rate was found, but there was insufficient statistical power to assess this outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10071598\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYPECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypectomy under hysteroscopic guidance is the treatment of choice for most endometrial polyps. </p><p>Hysteroscopic visualization of the polyp is the preferred approach, since blind curettage may miss small polyps and other structural abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Hysteroscopic instruments that may be used to remove a polyp include: grasping forceps, microscissors, electrosurgical loop (ie, resectoscope), morcellator, or a bipolar electrosurgical probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/55,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,58,59</a>]. Some surgeons visualize the polyp via hysteroscopy and then remove it using a blind approach (eg, using Randall polyp forceps or a Kelly clamp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. If this approach is used, the hysteroscope should be used again after polypectomy to confirm complete removal of the polyp.</p><p>For women with symptomatic polyps, polypectomy results in improvement of symptoms in 75 to 100 percent of patients, based upon studies with follow-up intervals of 2 to 52 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-polyps/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Complications of hysteroscopic polypectomy are infrequent, and the risk is the same as for other hysteroscopic procedures. General principles of hysteroscopy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, an endometrial polyp prolapses through the cervix and can be removed vaginally. A polypoid lesion at the external cervical os is most commonly a cervical polyp, but may be a prolapsed endometrial polyp or leiomyoma (see <a href=\"#H169911916\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above). The procedure for removal of a prolapsed endometrial polyp is the same as for a prolapsed leiomyoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid#H5351763\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prolapsed uterine leiomyoma (fibroid)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal myomectomy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Women who undergo removal of a prolapsed polyp without dilation of the cervix and visualization of complete removal should be counseled about the potential for recurrence.

(See <a href=\"#H348442\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among women undergoing endometrial biopsy or hysterectomy, the prevalence of endometrial polyps is 10 to 24 percent. (See <a href=\"#H348583\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial polyps are a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. They may also be asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H349326\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The great majority of endometrial polyps are benign, but malignancy occurs in some women. Endometrial polyps are more likely to be malignant in women who are postmenopausal and those who present with bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transvaginal ultrasound alone is typically sufficient for premenopausal women who have an indication for surgical management with operative hysteroscopy. For postmenopausal women with thickened endometrial stripes and premenopausal women with an uncertain finding on ultrasound alone or who are candidates for expectant management, we suggest sonohysterography (saline infusion sonogram) or diagnostic hysteroscopy. (See <a href=\"#H349427\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic ultrasound and hysteroscopy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an endometrial polyp is a histologic diagnosis based upon the evaluation of the specimen after it has been removed. Histologic evaluation can also exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For premenopausal women, symptomatic polyps require removal. We also suggest removal of asymptomatic polyps in premenopausal women with risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Polypectomy is also a reasonable option for women with polyps that are &gt;1.5 cm, multiple, or prolapsed, or for women who are infertile. (See <a href=\"#H1500838\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postmenopausal women, we recommend removal of all endometrial polyps (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
