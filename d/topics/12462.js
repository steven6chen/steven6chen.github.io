The source of massive hemoptysis may be identified either during the initial efforts to control the bleeding or later during a diagnostic evaluation once the patient has been stabilized. It is important to identify the cause of the massive hemoptysis even if the bleeding has ceased, since the cause determines the appropriate definitive treatment and the risk of recurrence. It also will help in early management of major re-bleeding.</p><p>The definition, diagnostic evaluation, and definitive treatment of massive hemoptysis are reviewed here. The initial management of massive hemoptysis (ie, positioning, airway control, controlling the bleeding) and the causes of massive hemoptysis are discussed separately.

Thresholds of 100 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], 200 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], 240 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], 500 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], 600 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and 1000 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] over 24 hours have been proposed, but none has been universally accepted. Some clinicians argue that a large volume of expectorated blood alone should not define massive hemoptysis, but rather, that abnormal gas exchange and hemodynamic instability should also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In our clinical practice, we define massive hemoptysis as either &ge;500 mL of expectorated blood over a 24 hour period or bleeding at a rate &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> regardless of whether abnormal gas exchange or hemodynamic instability exists. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5686367\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of blood expectorated has traditionally been used by clinicians to determine the severity of the hemoptysis. However, the identification of other risk factors may also be helpful in characterizing the severity of the hemoptysis. The physiologic impact and threat to the patient who presents with massive hemoptysis are greatly affected by the degree of underlying lung and heart disease. If a patient has little cardiopulmonary reserve, smaller amounts of bleeding may be life-threatening. For example if a patient has poor lung reserve for gas exchange, a relatively small amount of alveolar bleeding in this area may make it impossible to oxygenate the patient, even with high intubation and effective ventilation with high fractions of inspired oxygen. A retrospective cohort study of 1087 consecutive patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) over a 14-year period found that independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality included mechanical ventilation, lung densities involving two or more quadrants on an admission chest radiograph, bleeding from the pulmonary artery, cancer, aspergillosis, and alcoholism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24619289\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous causes of bleeding from the lower respiratory tract, as listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96527 \">table 1</a>). This list is not comprehensive as there are many diseases that can rarely cause hemoptysis, including massive hemoptysis. These etiologies are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2767161\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient presents with massive hemoptysis, the initial steps are to identify which lung(s) is (are) bleeding, appropriately position the patient, establish a patent airway, insure adequate gas exchange and cardiovascular function, and control the bleeding. Each of these steps are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>). The goal of this initial management is to render the patient clinically stable with either intermittent or slowing hemoptysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2767170\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The source of massive hemoptysis may be identified during the initial efforts to control the bleeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>). If it is not, then a dedicated diagnostic evaluation is necessary. The timing of the diagnostic evaluation depends upon the course of the hemoptysis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the hemoptysis is brisk despite initial measures to control the bleeding, then initial diagnostic efforts must begin in concert with ongoing efforts to stabilize the patient and control the bleeding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the hemoptysis is intermittent or slowing following initial measures to control the bleeding, then the diagnostic evaluation begins after the patient has stabilized.</p><p/><p>Bronchoscopy is an important early test because it can provide useful diagnostic and management information. For patients in whom bronchoscopy is non-diagnostic and who continue to bleed, we typically suggest arteriography as the next diagnostic test because it may be useful for therapy (embolization) as well as diagnosis. In contrast, for patients in whom bronchoscopy is non-diagnostic, but in whom the bleeding has ceased, we favor computed tomography (CT) of the chest with high-resolution cuts as the next diagnostic test. </p><p>Some diagnostic procedures, including bronchoscopy, may have already been performed in an effort to control the acute bleeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management#H4655186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Control the bleeding and correct coagulopathy'</a>). It is reasonable to repeat such tests later, during a more careful diagnostic evaluation, since visualization and diagnostic sensitivity are generally poor during acute pulmonary hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7373565\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC MODALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination may be helpful in determining the cause of hemoptysis, as well as in assessing pulmonary function and the severity of any chronic lung disease. The latter is important for deciding whether surgery is an option. The history and physical examination are rarely helpful for localizing the bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management#H4655275\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Identify which side is bleeding'</a>.). </p><p>The following issues are important to address when obtaining the history: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have known or suspected pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient currently smoke?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient previously smoked and how much?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient had prior hemoptysis, other pulmonary symptoms, or infectious symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of hemoptysis, brain aneurysms, epistaxis, or gastrointestinal bleeding (suggesting possible hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient had a skin rash?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient been exposed to trimellitic anhydride or other organic chemicals?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where has the patient travelled, either recently or in the past, and to what countries?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient been exposed to asbestos?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a known or suspected bleeding disorder?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-platelet drugs, or an anticoagulant?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a history of upper airway or upper gastrointestinal disease or symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient had tuberculosis (TB) or been exposed to TB?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient at high risk for TB or unusual parasitic disorders based upon travel history?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of blood clots in either the patient or his or her family?

Patients whose electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine suggest renal dysfunction may benefit from a platelet transfusion even in the context of a normal platelet count due to potential platelet dysfunction. Arterial blood gases are critical to assess the impact of the massive hemoptysis on oxygenation, ventilation, and the degree of respiratory reserve, which may guide therapeutic decisions. The purpose of the liver function tests and urinalysis is to provide clues about the underlying cause of the hemoptysis. Abnormal liver function tests may be a consequence of hepatic congestion due to heart disease, metastatic disease, or drugs or other toxins, while hematuria or red blood cell casts detected by urinalysis may indicate a pulmonary-renal syndrome (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly called Wegener's Granulomatosis], Goodpasture's Syndrome).</p><p>Additional laboratory testing may be helpful in selected patients. As examples, appropriate drug levels should be obtained (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) if there is a question of specific drugs playing a role and a bleeding time can be measured to confirm qualitative platelet dysfunction, such as that due to renal failure or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications. Cytology should be obtained if cancer is suspected and sputum may be sent for stains and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, and bacteria. Serologic tests including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), double-stranded DNA, and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM antibodies) may be very helpful if positive. A transthoracic echocardiogram may detect endocarditis, mitral stenosis, congenital heart disease, or pulmonary hypertension, while a transesophageal echocardiogram may identify a thoracic aortic aneurysm or right-sided intracardiac clot as the cause of hemoptysis.</p><p>Finally, patients who are capable of doing so should undergo pulmonary function testing at the bedside. This provides an assessment of the patient's pulmonary reserve and, therefore, is an indicator of whether the patient is a candidate for surgical intervention if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopic interventions used to control acute bleeding (eg, balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, topical medication) are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Bronchoscopy'</a>). This section addresses the diagnostic aspects of bronchoscopy in the setting of massive hemoptysis.</p><p>Flexible bronchoscopy is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice in most patients with massive hemoptysis because it can be performed at the bedside, it is readily available, and it often is successful at localizing the bleeding site if it is performed while the patient is bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In one study of 28 patients with massive hemoptysis, flexible bronchoscopy successfully localized the bleeding site in 26 patients (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sometimes if a specific site or region of bleeding is not seen, the side or lobe of bleeding may be determined.</p><p>We perform bronchoscopy early in a patient's course, even though bronchoscopy has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We believe that this approach provides clinicians with the maximal amount of information upon which to base future decisions, particularly in patients who develop sudden recurrence or acceleration of their bleeding. In addition, this strategy may lead to earlier treatment or earlier initiation of additional diagnostic testing. It also can help guide angiographic and embolization procedures. Practically speaking, we aim to perform bronchoscopy within the first 12 to 18 hours if the patient is clinically stable and their bleeding has become quiescent. Alternatively, we perform bronchoscopy as early as feasible if the patient is unstable.</p><p>Intubation for the bronchoscopy should be strongly considered when massive hemoptysis is the indication. This improves patient safety, as illustrated by the following examples. First, if the bleeding accelerates or recurs during the procedure, the bronchoscope often needs to be removed due to worsening oxygenation. Intubation maintains control of the airway and allows endotracheal suctioning to continue after the bronchoscope has removed. Second, if visualization becomes obscured by a clot on the tip of the bronchoscope, intubation facilitates the safe and efficient removal of the bronchoscope for cleaning, and rapid reinsertion to continue the examination. </p><p>Localizing the bleeding site requires visualization of active bleeding from a specific orifice or lobe. Finding blood clots within bronchi on one side is insufficient for localizing the bleeding with confidence. When active bleeding cannot be directly visualized, small volume lavage of multiple bronchial segments can sometimes help localize the bleeding site by identifying bronchi that contain fresh blood with ongoing washing. Once the bleeding site is localized, the area should be carefully inspected for a culprit lesion, such as a bronchogenic carcinoma or a telangiectasia. Even if the bleeding lesion cannot be identified, there may be other clues regarding the cause of the bleeding. As an example, erythematous and edematous airways in the area of bleeding may indicate an infection. Specimens should be taken for microbiological and cytological testing.</p><p>Rigid bronchoscopy is used less often than flexible bronchoscopy in the initial diagnostic evaluation of massive hemoptysis because it almost always is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia rather than at the bedside and it cannot visualize the airways as far distally as flexible bronchoscopy. However, rigid bronchoscopy may be helpful if flexible bronchoscopy is inadequate because rigid bronchoscopy has greater suctioning capacity, which may provide superior visualization. In addition, there are a wider variety of interventions available via rigid bronchoscopy, which is beneficial if a lesion is amenable to immediate treatment. Another option is to insert a flexible bronchoscope through the lumen of a rigid bronchoscopy, thereby combining the more distal visualization of the airways offered by flexible bronchoscopy with the superior suction capabilities and the wider range of therapeutic options offered by rigid bronchoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriography is generally performed if there is persistent bleeding following bronchoscopy. The preceding bronchoscopy may be helpful in identifying the side or area of bleeding, thereby assisting the radiologist in locating the precise bleeding site. Therapeutic embolization is possible during the diagnostic arteriography procedure. Arteriography for massive hemoptysis is discussed in the context of initial management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Arteriography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early computed tomography (CT) of the chest has been increasingly advocated to help localize the bleeding site and to diagnose the cause of the hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. It is generally performed in patients whose bronchoscopy was non-diagnostic and in whom arteriography is not necessary because the bleeding has ceased.</p><p>The major advantage of CT is that it may identify abnormalities that are difficult to detect by bronchoscopy and arteriography, such as bronchiectasis, lung abscess, pulmonary artery (Rasmussen's) aneurysm, and mass lesions (eg, cancer, aspergilloma, arteriovenous malformations). In addition, CT scans may identify a systemic arterial supply to a lesion. Features suggestive of a systemic blood supply include increased pleural thickness (&gt;3 mm) adjacent to a parenchymal lesion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enhanced vascular structures in a nearby extrapleural fat layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The primary disadvantages of chest CT are that it requires movement of the patient away from the intensive care unit and occasionally it may provide misleading results. As an example, a clot in an airway or bleeding into a cavity may be mistaken as a tumor mass on CT scan.</p><p>A prospective cohort study of 57 patients with hemoptysis compared bronchoscopy to chest CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. High resolution CT was particularly useful for detecting bronchiectasis and aspergillomas (ie, a fungus ball), while bronchoscopy was most useful for detecting &quot;bronchitis&quot; and endobronchial carcinoma. High resolution CT was diagnostic more often than bronchoscopy, although the study was criticized for having an unusually high percentage of patients with lesions amenable to diagnosis by CT: bronchiectasis (25 percent), tuberculosis (16 percent), aspergilloma (12 percent), and cancer (12 percent). Despite this study, most clinicians favor bronchoscopy prior to chest CT, largely due to the preference to not move a patient with massive hemoptysis from the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2546651\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With its increased availability in the ICU, echocardiography can be performed at the bedside to look for evidence of mitral stenosis, shunting through arteriovenous malformation (AVMs; bubble study), or endocarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3282312\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports have described using radionuclide scanning with tagged red blood cells to localize the bleeding site in patients with hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, this requires a rapid rate of bleeding and can give false localization if blood pools in dependent regions. From a practical standpoint, tagged red blood cell scanning is probably not very useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using both bronchoscopy and chest CT to evaluate hemoptysis appears to improve the diagnostic yield. The former examines inside of the airways, while the latter examines structures outside of the airways. This was illustrated by a study in patients with hemoptysis that found that lung cancer was diagnosed by chest CT alone with a sensitivity of 67 percent, bronchoscopy alone with a sensitivity of 42 percent, and chest CT plus bronchoscopy with a sensitivity of 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-massive-hemoptysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2767250\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive therapy for massive hemoptysis is treatment of the underlying cause. Bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, bronchogenic carcinoma, cystic fibrosis, and various lung infections appear to be the most common modern causes of hemoptysis and their treatment is reviewed separately.

In our clinical practice, we define massive hemoptysis as &ge;500 mL of expectorated blood over a 24 hour period or bleeding at a rate &ge; 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.(See <a href=\"#H11002558\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physiologic impact and threat to the patient who presents with massive hemoptysis are greatly affected by the degree of underlying lung and heart disease, the amount of blood retained in the lung, and ability to expectorate it.

Rigid bronchoscopy has greater suctioning capacity that may provide superior visualization.
