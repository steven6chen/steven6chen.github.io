However, it is important to avoid undermining the interview by asking direct questions prematurely, and to allow the patient to describe their illness from their own point of view.

However, loss of control is not absolute. Patients are usually ashamed of their behavior and try to conceal it, and will usually stop bingeing if someone unexpectedly enters the room.

Many patients employ multiple methods; the most common is self-induced vomiting, which may become an end in itself and occur after eating only small amounts of food.

Ipecac syrup (emetine) is rarely used to induce vomiting; chronic use may cause cardiac and skeletal myopathy. </p><p>Other inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain include fasting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, other medications (eg, thyroid hormone), or enemas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bulimia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In addition, binge eating and purging (ie, self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas) occur as part of anorexia nervosa, binge <span class=\"nowrap\">eating/purging</span> type. The key distinguishing feature of anorexia nervosa is an abnormally low body weight, as indicated by a body mass index &lt;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). By contrast, patients with bulimia nervosa usually maintain a body weight at or above a minimally normal level. Secondarily, the severe weight loss that occurs in anorexia nervosa is accompanied by anatomic and physiologic sequelae that are not found in bulimia nervosa.

The two disorders are distinguished by the inappropriate compensatory behaviors that regularly occur as part of bulimia nervosa, but are absent in binge-eating disorder. In addition, patients with bulimia nervosa typically restrict their diet between binge eating episodes to influence body weight and shape, whereas patients with binge eating disorder do not.

The prototypic sequence of behavior in bulimia nervosa consists of caloric restriction, binge eating, and self-induced vomiting. Body weight is usually within or above the normal range. (See <a href=\"#H8041571\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bulimia nervosa frequently have a lifetime history of at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, including unipolar major depression, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, <span class=\"nowrap\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder, alcohol use disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, illicit drug use disorder, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> personality disorders. In addition, patients are at increased risk for general medical complications and disorders. (See <a href=\"#H191477011\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the number of patients with bulimia nervosa who continue to meet full diagnostic criteria declines over time, recurrent binge eating and purging behaviors persist in many patients. In addition, remission is often followed by relapse. Bulimia nervosa is associated with increased rates of all-cause mortality, and suicide deaths occur more often in patients than the general population. (See <a href=\"#H172813392\" class=\"local\">'Course of illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic interview can be facilitated by first administering a self-report screening instrument. We suggest the SCOFF, which is a five-item self-report measure that screens for eating disorders. (See <a href=\"#H191479770\" class=\"local\">'Screening instruments'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H194448554\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment of the patient&rsquo;s psychiatric history and mental status should include questions about height, weight, frequency of self-weighing, meal patterns, present and past eating disorder symptoms (dietary restriction; binge eating; compensatory behaviors such as purging, fasting, and exercise; attitudes about body weight and shape, food, and eating; and ritualistic eating behaviors), suicidality, comorbid psychiatric disorders, psychosocial functioning, and family psychiatric history. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinicians should also assess suicidality, including suicidal ideation, action to prepare for an attempt, and nonfatal attempt or self-harm. Patients with suicidality should be seen more frequently and perhaps hospitalized, depending upon the estimated level of risk. A specific suicide plan of high lethality or intent indicates the need for hospitalization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73092 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H191479808\" class=\"local\">'Clinical interview'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of bulimia nervosa according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91105\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91105 \">table 4</a>). The diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) are largely the same, although ICD-10 emphasizes that bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are related to each other. (See <a href=\"#H22668229\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is substantial overlap between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; however, body weight is usually low in the former and normal in the latter. Other disorders (binge eating disorder, unipolar major depression, and borderline personality disorder) in the differential diagnosis of bulimia nervosa typically do not present with either inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain or excessive preoccupation with weight and body shape.
