They are generally much safer in overdose than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Commonly used SSRIs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>.</p><p>In 2015, an SSRI was mentioned in 52,546 ingestions (22,256 single-substance ingestions) reported to US poison centers, 114 major outcomes, and only three fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of SSRI ingestions has steadily increased and mirrors the increase in SSRI prescriptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Isolated SSRI ingestions generally produce mild symptoms, although SSRI intoxication can infrequently produce serotonin syndrome, seizures, CNS depression, or various cardiac abnormalities. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Citalopram</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> are structurally different from the other SSRIs and potentially more toxic in overdose.</p><p>The toxicity and management of acute SSRI overdose will be discussed here. A summary table to facilitate emergency management of SSRI poisoning is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82567 \">table 1</a>). Discussions of the therapeutic use of these medications, and of serotonin syndrome, are found elsewhere.

These neurotransmitters are stored in cytoplasmic vesicles of presynaptic neurons and released into the synapse with nerve depolarization. Transport proteins specific for serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine are embedded in the presynaptic terminal cell membrane and are responsible for pumping these neurotransmitters out of the synapse and back into the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the neurotransmitters are either repackaged into vesicles for reuse or degraded by monoamine oxidase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H14787857\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 98 percent of the body's serotonin is found outside the central nervous system (CNS). Several families of serotonin receptors, with multiple subtypes, have been discovered. In the CNS, serotonergic neurons are found in the brainstem, mostly in the raphe nucleus. They have a role in regulating mood, personality, appetite, wakefulness, emesis, temperature regulation, and sexual behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Peripherally, serotonin aids in regulating vascular tone, peristalsis, and platelet activation.</p><p>The SSRIs inhibit the reuptake mechanism of serotonin in CNS neurons, as well as peripherally and in platelets, thereby increasing the stimulation of serotonin receptors. Compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and other antidepressants, SSRIs are less effective at blocking reuptake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> and likely less able to antagonize muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are rapidly absorbed and reach a peak serum concentration within 6 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67511 \">table 2</a>). Most SSRIs demonstrate a high degree of serum protein binding, and most have a long elimination half-life, with sustained biological activity due to active metabolites. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paroxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a> are unusual in that they have no active metabolites. In overdose, SSRI elimination times are further prolonged by the saturation of metabolic enzymes and by delayed absorption, especially for sustained-release preparations.</p><p>Due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>'s active metabolite norfluoxetine and to the slow elimination of both, significant accumulation of these drugs and delays in reaching a steady state can occur. Significant serum concentrations can persist even four to five weeks after discontinuation of fluoxetine&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This can result in adverse drug interactions and toxicity, if a new antidepressant or serotonergic medication is introduced for up to a month after fluoxetine is stopped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67511 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>All SSRIs are metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system; most metabolites are renally excreted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should seek answers to the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which drugs were ingested (including all coingestants and drug formulations, eg, sustained release)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What amount was ingested?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When were the drugs ingested?</p><p/><p>Every effort should be made to obtain this information, particularly if the patient is unable to provide a history due to alterations in mental status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with intentional ingestions often develop greater toxicity than those with accidental exposures, so it is important to ask the patient directly about his or her intentions. Information obtained from the overdose patient can be unreliable, and confirmation should be sought if available. Additional history, including comorbid conditions and signs and symptoms, should be elicited from the patient, family members, friends, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and police.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination begins with assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Next, the clinician should attempt to identify any possible toxidromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 3</a>). Key elements of the physical examination include vital signs, mental status, pupil size, skin dryness and color, and bowel sounds (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and treatment'</a>). </p><p>Clinicians should look specifically for evidence of serotonin syndrome, including: hyperthermia; diaphoresis; slow, continuous, horizontal, eye movements (referred to as ocular clonus); hypertonia; hyperreflexia; tremor; and ankle clonus. Neuromuscular findings are generally more pronounced in the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of SSRI toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies comparing the ingestion of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with other antidepressants have found that SSRIs rarely produce fatality or serious sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. SSRIs are significantly less toxic than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). As an example, 31 to 32 percent of TCA ingestions require intubation, compared with 4 to 6 percent of SSRI ingestions. Similarly, 31 to 35 percent of TCA ingestions require intensive care unit admission, compared with 0 to 6 percent of SSRI ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/5,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,10</a>]. One study found an incidence of 1.6 deaths per million SSRI prescriptions, compared with 34.8 for TCAs and 20 for MAOIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>It is also important to note the potential disparity in toxicity between SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> reuptake inhibitors). SNRIs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> have been associated with greater risk of significant toxicity and mortality in overdose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SSRIs (except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>) have a wide therapeutic window: ingestion of up to 30 times the daily dose typically produces minor or no symptoms, while ingestion of 50 to 75 times the daily dose can cause vomiting, mild CNS depression, or tremor. Most fatalities are reported with either extremely large doses (greater than 150 times the daily dose) or with the presence of coingestants such as ethanol or benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanol-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethanol intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serotonin syndrome rarely occurs after isolated SSRI ingestions, but severe episodes can occur following either a mixed serotonergic ingestion or changes made in therapeutic SSRI dosing. Serotonin syndrome caused by isolated SSRI ingestion tends not be severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SSRI ingestions are unlikely to cause seizures or severe CNS depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Seizures have been noted to occur in 1 to 2 percent of SSRI overdoses, but they are typically short and self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, based on United States poison center data, seizure is a relatively common consequence of isolated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>SSRIs do not have significant cardiotoxicity. Unlike the TCAs, they are typically not associated with QRS prolongation or ventricular tachycardia. In a review of 469 isolated SSRI ingestions, bradycardia occurred in 8 percent of cases and tachycardia in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Citalopram</a>, which is structurally unlike the other SSRIs, is the most cardiotoxic: ingestion is associated with prolongation of the QTc interval, which can predispose a patient to torsade de pointes (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Citalopram'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Escitalopram</a> ingestions too can cause similar cardiotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Escitalopram'</a> below.)</p><p>Since SSRIs have little or no antagonism of muscarinic, histaminic, or adrenergic receptors, they do not typically cause anticholinergic symptoms, significant sedation, or hypotension.</p><p>In therapeutic dosing, SSRIs (specifically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>) may cause hyponatremia, most likely via the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The elderly appear to be at greatest risk of this complication.

It is typically caused by combining two or more serotonergic medications. Historically, MAOIs caused most cases, but SSRI interactions have become far more prevalent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serotonin syndrome often occurs several days to one week after the addition of a new serotonergic agent or after the dose of a serotonergic agent is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. Patients with SSRI overdose have a 10 to 14 percent incidence of serotonin syndrome, but many of these are mild presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. In a study of 469 isolated SSRI ingestions, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a> were most likely to cause a serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings critical to the diagnosis include: spontaneous or inducible muscle clonus; ocular clonus; agitation; diaphoresis; tremor; hyperreflexia; muscle rigidity; and hyperthermia. The syndrome can manifest a wide range of toxicity, and prognosis correlates with clinical findings. Patients with severe disease may develop acute hyperthermia (core temperature &gt;41.1&ordm;C), hypertension, tachycardia, agitated delirium, and muscle rigidity. Unless aggressive intervention is instituted promptly, these patients can go on to develop rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock.

Approximately half of fluoxetine ingestions remain asymptomatic, while the most frequently reported symptoms are nausea, vomiting, somnolence, tremor, agitation, and tachycardia. Most symptoms are benign and resolve quickly. Serious toxicity, such as dysrhythmias, seizures, central nervous system (CNS) depression, and respiratory arrest, is rare but can occur, especially when coingestants such as ethanol are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>]. Serious toxicity is typically attributed to the coingestant and not to fluoxetine.</p><p>A prospective study assessing toxicity found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> safer than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Two deaths occurred out of 124 patients in the TCA group; no deaths occurred out of 16 patients in the fluoxetine group. Moreover, no fluoxetine patient developed seizures, QRS prolongation, hypotension, serotonin syndrome, or required intubation. Mild CNS depression was seen in five of the fluoxetine overdoses.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluoxetine</a> overdose is well tolerated, even in very large amounts.

A reasonable approach is to perform a repeat ECG after 1 hour if the ingested agent may cause QRS prolongation, and again after 4 to 6 hours if concern for QTc prolongation persists. During this time, the patient should remain on a cardiac monitor to exclude the development of dysrhythmias, as ECG&rsquo;s only help determine the predisposition for a dysrhythmia. </p><p>A prolonged QTc interval predisposes to torsade de pointes, an intermittent ventricular dysrhythmia that can, albeit rarely, degenerate into potentially life-threatening monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. If on any subsequent ECG the QTc is longer than previous, the patient should remain on a cardiac monitor and another ECG performed in 4 to 6 hours. This is especially important for agents that have cardiotoxic metabolites, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>.

Next, the clinician should attempt to identify any possible toxidromes. Key parts of the physical exam are vital signs, mental status, pupil size, skin dryness and color, and bowel sounds (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation and treatment'</a>). Clinicians should look specifically for evidence of serotonin syndrome, including: hyperthermia, diaphoresis, ocular clonus, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, and ankle clonus. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of overdose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Serotonin syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific serum drug concentrations are generally not helpful in assessing or managing SSRI ingestions.

The greatest benefit from charcoal decontamination occurs if given within 1 to 2 hours following the ingestion. Because of the potential risk of aspiration and the lack of benefit, we recommend that multiple dose charcoal and charcoal additives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong> be given (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSRIs rarely produce fatality or serious sequelae, mainly due to their wide therapeutic window: ingestion of up to 30 times the daily dose typically produces minor or no symptoms, while ingestion of 50 to 75 times the daily dose can cause vomiting, mild central nervous system (CNS) depression, or tremor. Most fatalities are reported with either extremely large doses (greater than 150 times the daily dose) or with the presence of coingestants such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, or tricyclic antidepressants.
