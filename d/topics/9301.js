Interstitial lung disease causes inflammation and sometimes scarring in the lungs. This makes it hard for oxygen to get from the air into the lungs, which can make it hard to breathe.</p><p>There are many causes of interstitial lung disease, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune diseases &ndash; These are diseases in which the body's infection-fighting system attacks healthy tissue instead of infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medical conditions (such as cancer)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harmful substances that are breathed into the lungs over a long period of time &ndash; These include cigarette smoke, mold, chemicals, or dust from asbestos, silica, metals, or coal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation (high doses of X-rays)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain lung infections</p><p/><p>In some cases, though, doctors don't know what is causing a person's interstitial lung disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68595680\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of interstitial lung disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of interstitial lung disease are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing or feeling short of breath, especially with activity or exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dry cough that lasts for a long time</p><p/><p>Early on, some people have no symptoms. Their doctor or nurse finds out they have interstitial lung disease when they have a chest X-ray or breathing tests done for another reason.</p><p>Some medical conditions that cause interstitial lung disease also cause symptoms in other parts of the body. For example, some autoimmune disorders also cause skin or joint symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68595695\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for interstitial lung disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have interstitial lung disease, your doctor or nurse will want to know what's causing it. He or she will ask about your medicines, past medical conditions, and whether you have been around harmful substances you might have breathed in.</p><p>He or she will also order tests. The tests that are usually done to figure out the cause of interstitial lung disease include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of the chest &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart. It can show whether people also have a heart problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests, also called &quot;pulmonary function tests&quot; &ndash; These tests measure how well the lungs are working.</p><p/><p>In some cases, people might also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. It can show if your heart is pumping normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure in which a doctor uses a thin tube (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) to look inside the lungs and get a sample of fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lung biopsy &ndash; For a lung biopsy, a doctor does surgery or a procedure to take a small sample of tissue from the lung. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope. Not everyone will need a lung biopsy. It is done only if all of the other tests don't show what's causing the interstitial lung disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68595710\"><span class=\"h1\">How is interstitial lung disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of your interstitial lung disease and how severe your symptoms are.</p><p>If your lung disease is caused by an infection, your doctor might prescribe medicines to kill the germs causing the infection.</p><p>If your lung disease is caused by a medicine you take, your doctor will recommend that you stop taking that medicine.</p><p>Many people with interstitial lung disease are treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra oxygen (that you carry around with you in a tank)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines to reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines that &quot;calm down&quot; the immune system or prevent scarring</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary rehab &ndash; In pulmonary rehab, people learn exercises and ways to breathe that can help with symptoms.</p><p/><p>In some cases, people with severe interstitial lung disease might be treated with a lung transplant. This is surgery to replace 1 or both diseased lungs with healthy lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68595725\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breathing-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breathing tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asbestos-exposure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asbestos exposure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoidosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sarcoidosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatomyositis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatomyositis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyositis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polymyositis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-cough-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic cough in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoidosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sarcoidosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
