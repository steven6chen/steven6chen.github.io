Registration on this list by individual transplant programs is required before a patient can be allocated a deceased-donor organ.</p><p>This topic reviews the composition of and access to the kidney transplant waitlist in the United States, as well as the management of patients while they await kidney transplantation.</p><p>The details of the allocation algorithm for deceased-donor kidneys and issues related to the evaluation of the kidney transplant candidate are discussed separately.

The GFR can be determined by any modality, including direct measurement or any of the available estimating equations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20658806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Assessment of GFR'</a>.)</p><p>For candidates &ge;18 years old, the calculation of waiting time (which is used to prioritize candidates for kidney allocation) is based upon the earliest of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The date that the candidate starts regularly administered dialysis as an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The registration date if the patient is predialysis and the measured or estimated GFR is &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The date that the measured or estimated GFR becomes &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> if the patient is predialysis and was registered at a GFR &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span></p><p/><p>Predialysis patients who are referred for transplantation with a GFR that is already &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> are not retroactively assigned waiting time to the date that their GFR became &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Thus, early referral of predialysis patients for transplant is important in order to maximize their waiting time.</p><p>For candidates &lt;18 years old, waiting-list time begins either on the date of registration or the date of initiation of dialysis, whichever is earliest and regardless of the GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Candidates may be on the active or inactive list. A candidate in active status is eligible for transplantation if a kidney is offered. A candidate in inactive status is temporarily unavailable or unsuitable for transplantation and may not receive a deceased-donor organ offer. Candidates are placed in inactive status if an intercurrent condition develops that makes transplantation temporarily inadvisable, such as a treatable malignancy or infection. In November 2003, a United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy change was implemented to allow candidates to accrue waiting time indefinitely while in inactive status. This resulted in a steady increase in the number of waitlisted candidates in inactive status, who now comprise approximately 40 percent of the kidney waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2015, the most common reasons for inactive status among newly registered patients included incomplete work-up (71 percent), insurance issues (9 percent), too sick (8 percent), too well (5 percent), weight inappropriate for transplant (4 percent), candidate choice (2 percent), and candidate for living-donor transplant only (2 percent). Other reasons (all less than 1 percent) included a pending transplant, medical noncompliance, and substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of patients registered as waitlist inactive never convert to active status and either die or are removed from the waitlist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If a candidate receives a transplant or dies, the registering transplant hospital must notify the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) within 24 hours so that the candidate is removed from the list.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE WAITING LIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of patients registered for kidney transplantation has steadily increased over the last decade, although data indicate that this trend may be reversing. In 2015, the number of candidates registered for kidney transplant decreased for the first time in over a decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This trend coincided with a lower number of new candidate registrations in 2015 and an increase in the number of deceased-donor kidney transplants performed per annum over the last five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, a new kidney allocation system (KAS) was introduced in the United States in December 2014, which includes a provision designed to increase the utilization of kidneys recovered for transplantation through <span class=\"nowrap\">local/regional</span> allocation of kidneys with a kidney donor profile index (KDPI) score &ge;85 percent. However, the increase in deceased-donor transplantation preceded the implementation of the KAS. The true effect of the new KAS on the rate of deceased-donor transplantation and, in particular, the utilization rate of kidneys that were recovered for transplantation, is unclear.</p><p>Analysis of data provided by the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) yielded the following data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The percentage of older candidates (defined as &ge;65 years) has increased from 15 to 22 percent between 2005 and 2015, with a corresponding decrease in percentage of younger patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African Americans account for approximately 34 percent of listed registrants; this is similar to their representation in the chronic dialysis population and is approximately threefold higher than their frequency in the general population. The ratio of Caucasian to African-American listed registrants has remained unchanged over the last decade. The percentage of white candidates has decreased from 40 to 37 percent and that of Hispanics has increased from 17 to 20 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Representation of males is approximately 20 percent greater than females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood group type O registrants consistently comprise more than 50 percent of the list, followed by type A (29 percent), type B (16 percent), and type AB (2 to 3 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The percentage of patients with diabetes has increased from 30 to 36 percent since 2005.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six percent of waitlisted candidates had a calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) of 80 to &lt;98 percent, and 8 percent had a cPRA of 98 to 100 percent. The cPRA is an expression of the degree of predicted incompatibility to the donor pool and is derived by the number and type of pre-existing antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. The higher the cPRA, the more difficult it is to find an acceptable donor kidney.</p><p/><p>In the first full year following the implementation of the new KAS, there was a marked increase in the percentage of deceased-donor transplants performed among candidates with a cPRA &ge;99 percent and among candidates who had required dialysis for more than 10 years. Older patients (&ge;65 years old) received fewer deceased-donor kidney transplants, and younger patients (age 18 to 34 years old) received more deceased-donor transplants compared with the preceding year under the prior KAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation#H26253615\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;, section on 'Impact of revised policy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">WAITING TIME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2015, 44 percent of kidney recipients waited less than three years, and 14 percent of recipients waited more than five years for a kidney transplant. By comparison, the number of years that a recipient spent on dialysis prior to transplant indicated that patients waited considerably longer for a kidney transplant if wait time was defined by time spent in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as opposed to time spent on the kidney waiting list. As an example, in 2015, 39 percent of kidney recipients required dialysis for more than five years, and only 19 percent required dialysis for less than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This discordance is likely a byproduct of the new kidney allocation system (KAS), which backdated the waiting time start date to the date of dialysis initiation after its implementation on December 4, 2014. In the first full year after KAS implementation, there was a 33 percent increase in the percentage of patients transplanted with 5 to 10 years spent on dialysis and 138 percent increase in the percentage of patients transplanted with more than 10 years on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This revision in allocation system policy seems to have benefited African-American and Hispanic candidates, who historically are referred for kidney transplantation later in their disease course and generally wait longer for a kidney transplant compared with white candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the post-KAS era, a higher percentage of transplants were performed in African-American and Hispanic recipients, whereas a corresponding lower percentage were performed in white recipients.</p><p>Certain candidates generally have a longer waiting time:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time to transplant varies among blood types. Blood groups O and B patients wait the longest. Based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data as of March 31, 2015, blood groups AB and A have median wait times of two and three years, respectively, whereas blood groups O and B have median wait times of approximately five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitized candidates (ie, those with increased panel reactive antibodies [PRAs]) have a longer waiting-list time (approximately twice that of nonsensitized candidates). Sensitized candidates have antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens that are expressed on donor kidneys and are more likely to have a positive crossmatch to potential kidney donors. The antibodies develop as a result of blood transfusion, pregnancy, and prior failed transplants. As a group, previously transplanted patients waited approximately twice as long as those awaiting a first transplant because of allosensitization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DEATH ON THE WAITING LIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall mortality on the waiting list is approximately 5 percent per year, with a higher estimate of 7 percent per year for diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The death rate increases with age. For the years 2003 to 2013, the death rate was approximately 2 deaths per 100 waitlist years for patients 18 to 34 years of age, which increased progressively to 8 deaths per 100 waitlist years at risk for patients &gt;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients who are in inactive status on the waitlist have approximately double the risk of death while waiting as candidates in active status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Approximately half of the deaths on the waiting list occur in patients who are on inactive status. This has increased markedly over the last several years as compared with 30 percent of waiting-list deaths noted among those with inactive status in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>As compared with remaining on the waitlist, studies have shown that kidney recipients experience a higher risk of death in the early posttransplant period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This risk decreases with time after transplant, and survival eventually favors transplantation over dialysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Survival compared with dialysis'</a>). The duration of time after transplant required to reach equivalent survival depends on a number of factors, including recipient age, donor type, and waiting time incurred prior to transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCESS TO THE WAITING LIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deceased-donor transplantation requires access to the waiting list, which in turn requires access to a transplant center. Optimal outcomes occur when kidney transplantation is performed as early as possible after the development of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), preferably before dialysis is required (preemptive transplantation). Unfortunately, most CKD patients do not see a nephrologist until late in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, because of the prolonged wait for a kidney, preemptive transplantation from a deceased donor is only an option for a small proportion of CKD patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of variables have been reported to inhibit timely referral to transplantation. These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower level of educational attainment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower socioeconomic status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-English-speaking background</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minority race</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis in for-profit or isolated dialysis units</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medical diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p/><p>To minimize delays, patient and professional education about the benefits of early referral for transplantation is critical. For predialysis patients, early referral provides an opportunity to determine if a living donor is available and if the donor work-up can be completed expeditiously. This may facilitate the performance of preemptive transplantation and avoid access placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early referral and listing also expose patients to the possibility of being offered a zero-mismatch deceased-donor kidney. Potential recipients of zero-mismatch deceased-donor kidneys are given some priority in allocation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CARE OF TRANSPLANT CANDIDATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deceased-donor transplantation is unique among surgical procedures in that it is an urgent procedure performed in an elective population. It is not possible to accurately determine when a given patient will be called for transplantation, and patients on the active transplant list can be called for a transplant at any time.</p><p>This unpredictability poses unique challenges for transplant programs, which need to ensure that large numbers of patients, most of whom are not under their direct care, are medically cleared for transplant at all times. Therefore, it is imperative that the treating clinician keeps the transplant program appraised of clinically significant changes in the recipient&rsquo;s health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26255004\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine health maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be cared for according to best practices and published clinical practice guidelines.</p><p>In parallel, dialysis units, nephrologists, and the patients themselves must keep transplant programs appraised of major developments in the patients' health that could be relevant to their transplant candidacy and posttransplant management.

As such, most adult CKD patients who are being evaluated for transplantation undergo some form of cardiovascular screening at the time of initial evaluation and periodically during the waitlist period (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient#H119947167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>). However, it is not clear whether screening asymptomatic patients prior to transplantation provides any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] or which method of screening is optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>UpToDate&rsquo;s approach to cardiovascular screening at the time of initial evaluation for transplantation is discussed elsewhere.

Transplant centers generally take into account the patient&rsquo;s pretest probability for coronary heart disease and risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event when deciding whether to screen asymptomatic candidates (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease#H99485363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Who should be screened?'</a>). In our institution, we do not rescreen candidates who are on the waiting list with noninvasive tests until they approach the anticipated time of a kidney offer (generally within two years) or living donation is anticipated.</p><p>We select patients for rescreening based on the 2012 the American Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA)/American</span> College of Cardiology (ACC) clinical practice guidelines, endorsed by the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the American Society of Transplantation, and the National Kidney Foundation. We select for noninvasive stress testing asymptomatic kidney transplant candidates who have multiple coronary artery disease risk factors regardless of functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the utility of periodic cardiovascular testing for waitlisted candidates is considered uncertain. Coronary artery disease risk factors were adapted from the 2007 Lisbon Conference on the Care of the Kidney Transplant Recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior cardiovascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one year on dialysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyslipidemia</p><p/><p>Although opinion based, the committee considered three or more risk factors to be a reasonable threshold to consider noninvasive stress testing. Nevertheless, it is reported that noninvasive stress testing has variable predictive discrimination for the detection of coronary artery disease, ranging from a positive predictive value of 0.29 to 0.86 and a negative predictive value of 0.24 to 0.98 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery incorporate the use of a <a href=\"http://www.riskcalculator.facs.org/&amp;token=NZ+Wv3Krh3AGAR2UOebDuE641/7yb2OkIqyRjwToRzmxorsAXZVYUgJO0wvN/RXm&amp;TOPIC_ID=7333\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">multivariate risk prediction tool</a> for an estimate of the risk of perioperative major adverse cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.) For those at low risk (&lt;1 percent), noninvasive cardiac testing is not recommended. For those at higher risk, only those with unknown or poor functional capacity (&lt;4 METS) and in whom further testing will impact decision making or perioperative care are recommended for pharmacologic stress testing. Patients who can achieve &ge;4 METS are not recommended for preoperative cardiac testing.</p><p>Whether these recommendations are applicable to patients awaiting kidney transplantation is unclear.

In addition, excessive reliance on noninvasive tests that are not sufficiently accurate to exclude significant coronary heart disease in high-risk candidates may engender a false sense of security [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of increased physical activity on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality are well established in the general population, although prospective studies in patients with CKD are lacking.

In one study of Organ Procurement and Transplant Network <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN)/United</span> Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data from 2006 to 2012, the cumulative incidence of conversion to active status at six years among obese inactive candidates was 69 percent for those with a body mass index (BMI) &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> 54 percent for a BMI 35 to 39.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> 41 percent for a BMI 40 to 44.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> and 28 percent for a BMI &ge;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence that, paradoxically, obesity might be beneficial for dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and that loss of weight in order to obtain a transplant might be detrimental to outcome. Much of the data supporting these contentions, however, come from database analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and specific recommendations for individual patients should be individualized. Data indicate that obese kidney transplant recipients have a lower risk of death compared with remaining on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-kidney-transplant-waiting-list-in-the-united-states/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, it should not be taken for granted that weight loss in obese transplant candidates will always be in their interest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Registration on this list by individual transplant programs is required before a patient can be allocated a deceased-donor organ. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The active and inactive waiting list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates may be on the active or inactive list. A candidate in active status is eligible for transplantation if a kidney is offered. A candidate who is in inactive status is considered temporarily unavailable or unsuitable for transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The active and inactive waiting list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time to transplant for new candidates is more than 4.5 years and even longer for patients with blood type O and B and for sensitized candidates who have antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens that are expressed on donor kidneys. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Waiting time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall mortality on the waiting list is approximately 5 percent per year, with a higher estimate of 7 percent per year for diabetic patients. The death rate increases with age. Approximately half of the deaths on the waiting list occur in patients who are on inactive status. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Death on the waiting list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of variables have been reported to inhibit timely referral to transplantation. These include lower level of educational attainment, lower socioeconomic status, non-English-speaking background, minority race, female gender, dialysis in for-profit or isolated dialysis units, certain medical diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus, and obesity. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Access to the waiting list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients on the active transplant list need to be medically ready to undergo transplantation at any time. Optimal, routine health care is important and should be performed according to best practices and published clinical practice guidelines. Patients should be encouraged to engage in frequent physical activity while waiting for a transplant.
