It remains uncertain whether treatment only with the combination of chemotherapy plus a TKI will provide long-term survival results similar or better than allo-HCT in first remission. </p><p>Treatment of Ph+ ALL comprises multiple stages of therapy that, in total, may span several years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63462 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission induction &ndash; Induction therapy aims to reduce the total body leukemia cell population from approximately 10<sup>12</sup> to below the morphologically detectable level of approximately 10<sup>9</sup> cells.

However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a few weeks or months despite continuing on a TKI. Post remission consolidation is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Of critical importance, studies must be performed rapidly to confirm the presence of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> at presentation and rule out blastic transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Morphologic examination of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by an expert hematopathologist will generally allow for the exclusion of blastic transformation of CML (ie, CML presenting in lymphoid blast phase, although there is no gold standard for discriminating these disorders). Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood blasts can be evaluated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for <em>BCR-ABL1</em> (p190 and p210 transcripts) in order to rapidly confirm the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. When possible, the level of p190 or p210 transcripts should be measured relative to a housekeeping gene using real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). </p><p>Unlike the case in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, high resolution molecular studies have detected additional mutations in the <em>ABL1</em> kinase domain at diagnosis of Ph+ ALL that are likely to be resistant to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>. The clinical significance of these mutations remains to be determined, and we do not suggest routine mutation testing at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pathologic features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The speed with which intensive remission induction chemotherapy should begin varies with the individual patient's condition and treatment options. In general, it is more important to stabilize a patient's condition and control co-morbidities (eg, infection, bleeding, hyperuricemia, dehydration, renal dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia), than it is to immediately start chemotherapy. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> or corticosteroids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, should be used for cytoreduction of an elevated peripheral blast cell count while these problems are addressed. This interval of several days also allows for complete genetic screening where the results will have an impact on the choice of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58828926\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58830710\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction therapy is administered with the goal of achieving a complete hematologic remission. (See <a href=\"#H83277211\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating response to induction'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>The mainstay of induction therapy is treatment with a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is directed against the protein product of the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) reciprocal translocation (ie, the Philadelphia chromosome). However, the TKI must be combined with other therapy, since remissions induced by TKIs alone are short-lived. Ongoing studies are evaluating the use of various TKIs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a>), either in combination with ALL induction chemotherapy or in combination with steroids. The largest experience has been with imatinib combined with various ALL chemotherapy regimens. Individual TKIs have not been directly compared in this setting. The choice of TKI may be influenced by administration schedule, toxicity profile, comorbidities, cost, and the presence of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> mutations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964627389\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with ALL have a high risk of central nervous system (CNS) involvement and all current treatment regimens include CNS prophylaxis. The method of CNS prophylaxis used should be consistent with that included in the prospective studies investigating the particular treatment regimen chosen (eg, intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> with or without cranial irradiation). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'CNS prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58829265\"><span class=\"h2\">TKI plus chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend the use of TKI therapy plus combination chemotherapy for the initial treatment of Ph+ ALL. Numerous trials of a TKI in combination with chemotherapy have reported high CR rates (&gt;90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/19-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-32</a>]. Although this approach has not been directly compared to chemotherapy alone in a randomized trial, addition of a TKI has resulted in more durable and higher complete remission (CR) rates that allow more patients to proceed with post-remission therapy, and has improved disease-free survival and overall survival, compared with historical controls.</p><p>The addition of a TKI to chemotherapy adds minimal additional toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/19-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-28</a>]. Virtually all patients treated with TKI plus chemotherapy will attain a hematologic response, and most treatment failures are due to early mortality (approximately 5 percent total). In contrast, patients with Ph+ ALL treated with chemotherapy alone have a median survival time of less than nine months, primarily due to a high early relapse rate. </p><p>Examples of clinical trials in which a TKI was added to chemotherapy include (see <a href=\"#H58829694\" class=\"local\">'Choice of TKI'</a> below): &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II trial of induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> plus combination chemotherapy in 80 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL resulted in a CR rate of 96 percent with approximately 70 percent achieving complete molecular remission (defined as no detectable <em>BCR-ABL1</em> by PCR) and one-year event-free and overall survival (OS) rates of 60 and 76 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A significant number of patients who did not go on to receive an allogeneic transplant were still alive at one year. These outcomes compared favorably with historical controls treated with combination chemotherapy without imatinib at the same center, who had a CR rate of 51 percent and significantly lower rates of one-year event-free and overall survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> plus combination chemotherapy in 71 patients with Ph+ ALL over 55 years old (EWALL 01) achieved a CR rate of 96 percent, with 65 percent of patients achieving 3 log reduction in <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcript during consolidation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The initial response to induction therapy is typically evaluated with a unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy once adequate values for absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;1000/microL)</span> and platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;100,000/microL)</span> are obtained. A core biopsy is required to accurately assess marrow cellularity.</p><p>The bone marrow specimen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral blood should also be examined for persistence of the Philadelphia chromosome by cytogenetic techniques or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to document the extent of complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR). The importance of achieving a CCyR was shown in the International ALL trial; when all patients with ALL (those with or without Ph chromosome) were analyzed, patients achieving or not achieving CCyR had overall survival rates of 45 versus 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Subsequent therapy is based upon the achievement of a CCyR.</p><p>While CR has historically been defined based upon morphologic criteria, an assessment of minimal residual disease using immunological or molecular techniques can better define prognosis. Assessment of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> by polymerase chain reaction offers a convenient and powerful tool for quantitatively measuring residual disease with greater sensitivity. As yet, prospective studies have not directly demonstrated that altering therapy based upon evidence of minimal residual disease after induction leads to a better outcome but it may offer informative guidance and alert during follow-up in case of persistent BCR-ABL1 positivity. The optimal time point to measure minimal residual ALL in adults (ie, immediately after achieving CR or later during post-remission therapy) for clinical decision-making has not adequately been studied.

A choice among available regimens must take into consideration the physician&rsquo;s comfort and experience with administering the regimen, the side effect profile, and patient comorbidities. Whenever possible, a preference should be given for a regimen that has published outcomes when administered with a TKI. (See <a href=\"#H58829685\" class=\"local\">'Choice of chemotherapy regimen'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, when available, because it may be better tolerated by some patients, and it is effective in some <em>BCR-ABL1</em> mutations that do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Imatinib, dasatinib, and other TKIs have demonstrated activity in the treatment of Ph+ ALL, but have not been directly compared in clinical trials of Ph+ ALL. The choice of TKI is influenced by toxicity profiles, administration schedules, comorbid illnesses, cost, and patient preferences, but the best schedule and duration of TKI treatment are not known. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general treatment principles apply to most disease presentations and patient populations. However, certain age groups and comorbidities have unique therapeutic implications. (See <a href=\"#H83276421\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy for Ph+ ALL is toxic, primarily to the hematopoietic system, but also to the heart and nervous system. Many patients will require hospitalization with daily laboratory monitoring and supportive care with blood products and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H83277204\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring during treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attainment of a hematologic complete remission is the first step in the treatment of Ph+ ALL. Deeper levels of response can be measured using cytogenetic, molecular, or flow cytometry techniques. However, relapse can be expected in the following weeks to months if no further therapy is given. Post-induction therapy is an essential component of the treatment of Ph+ ALL. This is presented separately.
