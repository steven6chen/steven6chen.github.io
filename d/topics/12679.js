In the United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in women. In addition, breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women ages 40 to 49 years.</p><p>Breast cancer is treated with a multidisciplinary approach involving surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology, which has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the initial treatment of breast cancer and posttreatment surveillance. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, staging of breast cancer, and specific discussions of the multimodality treatments for early breast cancer and the approach to metastatic disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of local therapies in metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer are managed differently, we will restrict discussion in this topic to invasive breast cancer. A discussion on DCIS is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ductal carcinoma in situ: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3101248\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in the United States and developed countries have no evidence of metastatic disease. For these patients, the treatment approach depends on the stage at presentation. For treatment purposes, breast cancer is characterized using the Tumor, Node, Metastasis system (TNM). Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>). This staging system is effective in the United States as of January 1, 2018, but was implemented elsewhere as of January 1, 2017. It is recognized that the studies cited in UpToDate topics may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. Moreover, the AJCC recommends use of the prognostic staging system for breast cancer that incorporates biomarkers, if resources are available (<a href=\"https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/deskreferences/Documents/AJCC+Breast+Cancer+Staging+System.pdf&amp;token=9C/HlAFox0T/AWchomBBi+u1mexzaLkAiZEafFtZYCZUnouAf5NT+8+cq7kaqFDqosXkJLOVb2FUSS4XzpejREQbmyjgPYcQJn7ij9/vZYBElpTJYq0CTt8JYVgO8Dwt&amp;TOPIC_ID=737\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AJCC eighth edition breast staging</a>). This staging system is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Nonmetastatic breast cancer is broadly considered in two categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early stage</strong> &ndash; This includes patients with stage I, IIA, or a subset of stage IIB disease (T2N1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Locally advanced</strong> &ndash; This includes a subset of patients with stage IIB disease (T3N0) and patients with stage IIIA to IIIC disease.</p><p/><p>Approximately 5 percent of patients will have simultaneous metastatic disease identified at the initial presentation (de novo stage IV breast cancer). The treatment approach to these patients is discussed separately.

Following definitive local treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy may be offered based on primary tumor characteristics, such as tumor size, grade, number of involved lymph nodes, the status of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and expression of the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376306286\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast-conserving therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is comprised of breast-conserving surgery (BCS, ie, lumpectomy) plus radiation therapy (RT). The goals of BCT are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast. BCT allows patients with invasive breast cancer to preserve their breast without sacrificing oncologic outcome. Successful BCT requires complete surgical removal of the tumor (with negative surgical margins) followed by moderate-dose RT to eradicate any residual disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among women with operable breast cancer, randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent disease-free and overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. However, since the time that these trials were conducted, progress has been made in adjuvant therapy, and more recent observational studies suggest that breast-conserving therapy is associated with at least comparable survival to mastectomy, and even with improved survival in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. </p><p>Criteria that preclude BCT include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Patient selection for BCT'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicentric disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large tumor size in relation to breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of diffuse malignant-appearing calcifications on imaging (ie, mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior history of chest RT (eg, mantle radiation for Hodgkin disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistently positive margins despite attempts at re-excision</p><p/><p>For patients who desire BCT but are not candidates at the time of presentation, an alternative approach is the use of neoadjuvant therapy, which may allow for BCS without compromising survival outcomes.

If the likelihood of postmastectomy RT is high preoperatively, this may affect the choice of mastectomy type, the choice of the reconstructive approach, and optimal timing of the breast reconstruction (immediate versus delayed). Based upon the Early Breast Cancer Trialists&rsquo; Collaborative Group meta-analysis of 3786 women with invasive breast cancer undergoing an axillary dissection and mastectomy, there was a reduction in recurrences for node-positive women ([n = 1314, one to three nodes positive] and [n = 1772, four or more nodes positive]) undergoing postmastectomy radiation, but not for node-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Thus, preoperative coordination of care assures the best outcome. In many centers, this is accomplished by multi-disciplinary breast clinics.

Although internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes may be involved at the initial presentation, they rarely occur in the absence of axillary node involvement.
