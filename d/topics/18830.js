A new study reports that adoption of these laws has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of recurrent concussions among US high school athletes and has also been associated with increased reporting of new concussions from the prelaw through the postlaw period, likely attributable to increased awareness and identification of concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These laws consist of three components: 1) mandatory removal of athletes with confirmed or suspected concussion from play; 2) clearance from a licensed health professional before athletes may return to play; and 3) annual education of coaches, parents, and athletes on the signs and symptoms of concussion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management#H2860610477\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Management&quot;, section on 'Impact of legislation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115228\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of concussion in United States adolescents (October 2017)</span></p><p>A cross-sectional survey of over 13,000 United States middle and high school students found the prevalence of concussion to be approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children participating in contact sports are more likely to report having had a concussion (32 percent) compared with those reporting noncontact sports participation (18 percent) or no sports participation (11 percent). Participation in contact sports was also associated with reporting more than one concussion. These findings, consistent with other evidence, indicate that concussion is a common injury that occurs most frequently in adolescent athletes who participate in contact sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, or soccer.

Magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA), when available, is the preferred imaging technique for diagnosing SLAP tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a metaanalysis of 23 studies (over 2000 examinations) that compared modern 3-Tesla MR scanners with older 1.5-Tesla scanners, the diagnostic accuracy of 3-Tesla magnetic imaging (MRA or MRI) was comparable or better than 1.5-Tesla magnetic imaging, but whether 3-Tesla MRI has similar or better diagnostic accuracy than 1.5-Tesla MRA is not known.

A recent systematic review of randomized trials of nonsurgical interventions for shoulder impingement identified the overall quality of the studies as very low, but found that physical therapy programs that emphasize specific exercises for the rotator cuff and scapular muscles to be among the most effective interventions for improving shoulder function and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These findings support our approach to the treatment of this condition.

Until now, best estimates have suggested an incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000 athlete-years. In a new study using 2009 to 2014 data from a Canadian database recording all out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) in Ontario, Canada, the overall rate of SCA in athletes was 0.76 per 100,000 athlete-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With 44 percent of patients surviving to hospital discharge following SCA, the overall rate of SCD was 0.42 per 100,000 athlete-years. These data suggest the incidence of SCD in athletes is one-fourth of previous estimates and raise a question about the role of preparticipation screening.

In a case-control study of nearly 3000 men whose cognitive function was assessed at age 65 years, past participation in high school American football was not associated with worse cognition, mood, or other emotional symptoms compared with non-participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-sports-medicine-primary-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although somewhat reassuring, these data have significant limitations, and more longitudinal studies are needed to determine modifiable risk factors for CTE and other forms of dementia.
