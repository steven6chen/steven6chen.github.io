However, prognostic estimates in patients with advanced terminal cancer may have increased importance as they approach the end of life, since this is a natural time to formally reevaluate the goals of treatment, with palliative care becoming more prominent, and disease-directed therapy less so.</p><p>However, despite its importance, prognostication in advanced terminal cancer is imperfect. Clinicians are typically optimistic in their estimates of patient survival, and the prognostic estimates they communicate to patients may be even more optimistic. As an example, in a national study of 1193 patients with terminal stage IV lung or colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy, 69 percent of those with lung cancer and 81 percent of those with colorectal cancer inaccurately believed that chemotherapy was potentially curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some of this misinformation may also be attributed to a lack of communication between oncologists and their patients about estimated life expectancy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy of survival estimates'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Communication of survival estimates'</a> below.) </p><p>In an effort to improve these estimates, investigators are integrating previously established prognostic factors into easy-to-use models that clinicians can use in the clinical care of their patients with advanced terminal cancer. The goal of improved prognostication is to provide patients with a better understanding of their expected survival, thereby allowing them to make informed medical and social choices regarding their treatment path at the end of life, whether disease-directed, palliative, or a combination of both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Here we discuss general aspects of estimating survival in patients with advanced terminal cancer. Prognostic estimates and the factors that influence outcome in specific cancers are discussed in separate topic reviews that cover individual tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCURACY OF SURVIVAL ESTIMATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival estimates that clinicians make, guided only by their intuition and clinical experience, are usually incorrect, and the direction of the error is almost always optimistic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>]. That is, clinicians tend to believe that their patients have longer to live than they actually do. The disparity in actual versus estimated survival varies in different studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76199 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/4-8,13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8,13-19</a>]. In an illustrative study, 343 physicians referring 468 patients to one of five Chicago-area hospices were asked to provide an estimate of their patient&rsquo;s prognosis (&ldquo;What is your best estimate of how long this patient has to live?&rdquo;), and they compared these prognostic estimates with actual survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The median observed patient survival was 24 days, but the mean ratio of predicted to observed survival was 5.3.</p><p>Nevertheless, the clinician&rsquo;s intuitive estimates are of value, particularly when integrated with other methods to estimate the length of remaining life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/6,7,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,20,21</a>]. As an example, in one study, multivariate regression models that included physicians&rsquo; prognostic estimates were more accurate than models without physician input [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, while it is true that statistical models can be more accurate than human intuition alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], it is also true that physicians provide important information that is not captured in the models alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATION OF SURVIVAL ESTIMATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the inability of clinicians to accurately predict survival, patients expect open and honest communication regarding their prognoses. In a survey of 126 patients recently diagnosed with cancer, 98 percent wanted their doctor to be realistic about their prognosis and provide an opportunity to have their questions answered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The clinician behaviors that were most important to the patient included offering information about current treatments, being knowledgeable about the cancer, and providing reassurance that pain would be controlled. Patient preferences for disclosure of serious news are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news#H6928139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;, section on 'Patients&rsquo; preferences when receiving serious news'</a>.)</p><p>Although medical oncologists report routinely informing their terminally ill patients that they will die, many do not routinely communicate an estimated survival time to their patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In an analysis of 590 patients with advanced cancer (median survival 5.4 months), 71 percent wanted to be told their life expectancy, yet only 18 percent recalled a prognostic disclosure by their physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients who report recent discussions of prognosis and life expectancy with their oncologists have a better understanding of the terminal nature of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>For those who do provide an estimate of life expectancy, just as there is unconscious optimism in the intuitive estimates that clinicians make about their patients&rsquo; prognoses, there is also additional, and likely more conscious, optimism in the prognostic estimates that clinicians actually communicate to their patients. This was illustrated in a study in which investigators asked clinicians referring terminally ill cancer patients for hospice care how long they thought their patient had to live [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. They also asked clinicians what prognosis, if any, they would communicate to the patient if the patient were insistent on receiving a temporally specific estimate. The median survival that clinicians estimated for their patients was 75 days, the median survival that clinicians would communicate to patients was 90 days, and the median observed survival was actually only 24 days.</p><p>Finally, even when clinicians believe that they have had completely thorough discussions about prognosis with patients, there is a high frequency of discordance between patients&rsquo; opinions about their prognosis and that of their oncologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a national study of 1193 patients with terminal, stage IV, lung or colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy, 69 percent of those with lung cancer and 81 percent of those with colorectal cancer inaccurately believed that chemotherapy was potentially curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross-sectional analysis of 236 patients with advanced cancer and 38 oncologists from nine different practices, two-thirds of the patients had opinions about prognosis that differed from that of their oncologist, nearly all were more optimistic than the oncologist, and only 1 in 10 discordant patients knew that their opinions differed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Discordance was even more common among non-white patients.</p><p/><p>These data suggest that there is a great need for improvement in physician-patient communication in the context of advanced cancer.

It has consistently been found to predict survival in patients with cancer, and it is used in that capacity as an entry criterion and an adjustment factor for clinical trials of anticancer therapies. A number of metrics have been developed to quantify performance status; among them, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 3</a>) are the most commonly used.</p><p>The KPS ranges from values of 100, signifying normal functional status with no complaints nor evidence of disease, to 0, signifying death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 3</a>). Numerous studies have described an association between survival in patients with cancer and their KPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/4,6,10,15,32-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,10,15,32-46</a>]. The magnitude of the association is described differently depending upon the statistical methods employed in various trials, but a KPS of less than 50 percent consistently suggests a life expectancy of less than eight weeks for patients enrolled in palliative care programs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56650 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/4,6,15,33,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,15,33,47</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.npcrc.org/files/news/palliative_performance_scale_PPSv2.pdf&amp;token=7glf2xtn3A0YC/Xhi1Ue2yu5qd58vttW8oVUyVpANVYhy2lgKfO1EWeT6Kru8iCahkVdQSNtVVi+q5OXXLSJUoOa96FpJMRjdEro+VruVjI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2206\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">palliative performance scale (PPS),</a> which includes information about self-care, oral intake, physical activity, disease extent, and level of consciousness, has been found to have similar predictive accuracy for survival as the KPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/44,48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48-53</a>]. Since the KPS and the PPS appear to be highly correlated, these two scales may be used interchangeably in many populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of clinical signs and symptoms as independent prognostic factors was first described in 1966 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In particular, dyspnea is strongly and inversely associated with survival in terminally ill cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/10,15,33,43,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,33,43,56-58</a>].</p><p>In a qualitative systematic review examining over 100 different variables from 22 studies of patients with advanced cancers, the authors reported that, after performance status, certain discrete signs and symptoms were the next best predictors of patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Dyspnea, dysphagia, weight loss, xerostomia, anorexia, and cognitive impairment had the strongest evidence for independent association with cancer patient survival in these studies. The range of median survivals for the various signs and symptoms reported in univariate analyses from these and other studies is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56650 \">table 4</a>). These findings suggest that for patients with advanced terminal cancer, such as those referred to palliative care programs, the presence or absence of these symptoms may help clinicians estimate patient survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Integrated prognostic models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, clinical researchers are developing easy-to-use prognostic models that combine elements from established prognostic domains (eg, clinicians' clinical predictions, patient performance statuses, patient-reported signs and symptoms, primary and metastatic sites) to render more accurate survival estimates. To select the most appropriate prognostic tool for a given patient, clinicians need to understand the characteristics of the population in which each tool was developed and validated to determine whether it is applicable (generalizable) to the individual patient.</p><p>Broadly, tools have been developed through study of at least two distinct types of patients with advanced cancer: those who have already been referred for purely palliative care and those who may still be receiving, or at least are still candidates for, disease-directed therapy. While models have been derived in these two different patient populations, it is not clear that prognosis differs all that much. In fact, at least two studies demonstrate that patients receiving early palliative care in conjunction with disease-directed treatments have extended survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]<em>.</em> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care#H914734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;, section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review of cancer presentations with a median survival of six months or less concluded that there was little evidence that disease-directed treatment improved survival in the terminal stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The authors established a series of clinical factors that were associated with a median survival of six months or less in a variety of tumor types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87452\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87452 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93043526\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis in patients receiving palliative care only</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients choosing to enroll in palliative care, the Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI) provides objective estimates of likely survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71424 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/57,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,62</a>]. The PPI, which was developed in advanced cancer patients who had already enrolled in palliative care, can predict three-week survival with a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 85 percent, respectively, and six-week survival with a sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 77 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Several other groups have developed similar scoring systems that rely on integration of all or some of the previously described classes of prognostic indicators of patients with advanced cancer who are already receiving palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/16,43,63-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,43,63-68</a>].</p><p>Other investigators used information on ECOG performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>), time from initial diagnosis to diagnosis of terminal disease, serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, and lymphocyte count from 406 terminally ill cancer patients to construct a nomogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70086 \">figure 1</a>) to predict the probability of survival at 15, 30, and 60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
