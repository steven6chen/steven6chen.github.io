Among such patients, total body iron stores are adequate, but iron release from these stores into the circulation is not rapid enough to provide sufficient iron to support the increased erythropoietic rate being driven by the ESA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, many CKD patients also have anemia of chronic disease, which is related to an underlying inflammatory state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Anemia of chronic disease is mediated in part by upregulation of hepcidin by inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Hepcidin is a hormone that is produced and secreted by the liver and inhibits release of iron from reticuloendothelial macrophages and hepatocytes into plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hepcidin levels are increased in CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is clinically important to determine whether functional iron deficiency is related to ESA therapy or to anemia of chronic disease. However, it is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities. The distinction is often made retrospectively after observing the erythropoietic response to administration of intravenous iron with or without a concomitant increase in ESA dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Functional iron deficiency related to ESA administration may respond to intravenous iron, while anemia of chronic disease will not improve. The response to intravenous iron and an increase in ESA dose among patients thought to have functional iron deficiency was examined in the Dialysis Patients' Response to Intravenous Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study in which 134 patients with anemia, elevated ferritin levels (500 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> low transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels (&le;25 percent), and high ESA requirements were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric gluconate</a> or placebo along with a 25 percent increase in ESA dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At six weeks, hemoglobin (Hb) levels had increased significantly more in the active-therapy group (1.6 versus 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Clinical outcomes beyond an increase in Hb level were not assessed, and the long-term safety of this approach is not established.</p><p/><p>Diagnostic tests for absolute and functional iron deficiency are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45263676\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMONLY USED TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally diagnostic tests for anemia should detect iron deficiency (both absolute and functional) and predict whether patients will respond to administered iron. There is no single test that does both.</p><p>The gold standard for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is measurement of iron stores in bone marrow obtained on biopsy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>). However, bone marrow biopsies to assess iron stores are rarely done in CKD patients.

Laboratory criteria used to define iron deficiency and provide indication for treatment are markedly different among CKD patients compared with patients with normal renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H2292235433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The TSAT and ferritin criteria are different for absolute and functional iron deficiency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absolute iron deficiency &#9472;</strong> Among CKD patients, absolute iron deficiency, defined by diminished or absent bone marrow iron stores on biopsy, is likely to be present in patients when [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The percent TSAT (plasma iron divided by TIBC x 100) is &le;20 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The serum ferritin concentration is &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> among predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients or is &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> among hemodialysis patients. This difference in the serum ferritin level is based upon accumulating evidence in hemodialysis patients that the maintenance of ferritin levels &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is associated with decreased erythropoietin requirements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By comparison, patients with normal renal function and severe iron deficiency anemia typically have a serum ferritin concentration &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. The ferritin is commonly higher among iron-deficient CKD patients because it increases in response to diffuse inflammation, which characterizes advanced renal failure and dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammation in renal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the ferritin is above 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> most patients will have stainable bone marrow iron that would be considered sufficient among patients without CKD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, among hemodialysis patients, neither the TSAT nor serum ferritin predicts with accuracy which patients will have an improved response to ESAs after iron supplementation; many hemodialysis patients with TSAT 20 to 30 percent and serum ferritin 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> will respond to supplemental iron administration with an increase in Hb level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduction in ESA dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result, such patients are commonly treated with iron prior to treatment with an ESA. Patients with TSAT and transferrin &gt;30 percent and 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively, are unlikely to respond to iron supplementation, although iron supplementation leading to higher TSAT and ferritin levels is common in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional iron deficiency &#9472;</strong> As noted above, in addition to absolute iron deficiency, hemodialysis patients may also have functional iron deficiency related to ESA administration or to anemia of chronic disease. (See <a href=\"#H2972691509\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both ESA-induced functional deficiency and anemia of chronic disease are characterized by TSAT that is commonly &le;20 percent and elevated ferritin levels (as high as 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or even higher). Patients with ESA-induced functional iron deficiency may respond to intravenous iron in association with a concomitant increase in ESA dose with a decrease in ferritin levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, anemia of chronic disease is most likely present if the weekly administration of intravenous iron (50 to 125 mg) for up to 8 to 10 doses fails to result in increased erythropoiesis; instead, this course of iron therapy typically results in a progressive increase in ferritin concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oral iron administration is of little or no value in distinguishing absolute or functional iron deficiency from inflammatory states since iron absorption is low in all of these conditions and oral iron is generally ineffective in treating anemia in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients#H3151854579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Dosing and administration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Percent hypochromic HRCs and reticulocyte hemoglobin content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The percent hypochromic red blood cells (HRCs) and the CHr estimate the Hb content of red blood cells, not the amount of stored iron. As a result, they are more sensitive indicators of functional iron deficiency and are as good as or possibly better than the serum iron, TSAT, and ferritin at predicting whether or not a patient will respond to iron administration. A meta-analysis performed for the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines demonstrated that HRC &gt;6 percent predicted patients who would respond to iron as well as a TSAT &lt;20 percent and ferritin &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
