The dome-shaped diaphragm is the chief muscle of inspiration and the most powerful of the respiratory muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The other main muscles of inspiration are the scalenes, external intercostals, and sternomastoids. The muscles of expiration are the internal intercostals and the muscles of the abdominal wall (including the rectus abdominus, internal and external obliques, and transversus abdominus).</p><p>In addition to its role in the respiratory pump, the diaphragm also serves as a mechanical barrier between the abdominal and thoracic cavities and maintains the pressure gradient between the cavities.</p><p>The causes and diagnostic evaluation of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in adults will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease, the disorders of control of ventilation, the evaluation of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, the evaluation and management of diaphragm paralysis in the newborn, and the management of diaphragmatic paralysis in adults are reviewed separately.

The diaphragmatic muscle fibers radiate centrifugally and insert peripherally onto the inner surface of the lower six ribs laterally, the costal cartilages and sternum anteriorly, and the arcuate ligaments that extend from the upper lumbar vertebrae to the 12<sup>th</sup> ribs posteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The crura are posterior muscle bundles that run from the medial central tendon to the upper lumbar vertebral bodies posteriorly (L1 to L3 on the right, and L1 to L2 on the left).</p><p>The left and right sides of diaphragm are innervated by the ipsilateral phrenic nerves, which derive from cervical nerve roots three, four, and five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Each nerve divides into four trunks that innervate the anterolateral, posterolateral, sternal, and crural portions of the diaphragm on that side.</p><p>Contraction of the diaphragm has the following effects that promote air movement into the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in intrapleural pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation of the rib cage, using the abdomen as a fulcrum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion of the rib cage by generating positive intraabdominal pressure</p><p/><p>Although the diaphragm performs most of the work of breathing, normal ventilation also requires the simultaneous contraction of some of the accessory muscles of respiration (eg, scalene and the parasternal portions of the internal and external intercostal muscles). These muscles elevate and expand the upper ribcage during inspiration and pull the ribcage down and in during expiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERED FUNCTION WITH DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaphragmatic paralysis can involve either the whole diaphragm (bilateral) or only one leaflet (unilateral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. Depending upon the degree of diaphragmatic compromise, the other hemidiaphragm or the accessory muscles of respiration assume some or all the work of breathing. This compensation is achieved by more intense contraction of the accessory muscles and by the progressive recruitment of other, less important accessory inspiratory muscles (sternomastoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis minor and major). Patients may also recruit abdominal muscles to augment exhalation, which forces the respiratory system to a low volume (below functional residual capacity) at end-exhalation. The low volume increases the elastic recoil energy in the chest wall, assisting the next inspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BILATERAL DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a severe form of respiratory muscle weakness and needs prompt evaluation and management.

In some cases, however, the diaphragm is the initial or only muscle involved. The most common causes of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are the motor neuron and the generalized muscle diseases, although some cases are idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74792 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17479766\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal cord disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent diaphragmatic paralysis occurs in patients with destructive processes involving the cervical spine, such as large tumors and spinal cord transection.

However, some patients with motor neuron disease have diaphragmatic involvement that precedes or is greater than involvement of peripheral muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

As examples:</p><p>Some patients with peripheral nerve disease have primary involvement of the diaphragm. Examples include patients who develop reversible diaphragmatic paralysis after cardiac surgery and patients with post-polio syndrome. Post-polio syndrome occurs in some patients who experienced respiratory insufficiency and bulbar polio during the epidemic of the 1950s and then developed new respiratory symptoms later in life. Severe decompensation due to post-polio syndrome is unusual. It is unclear whether such progression is due to motor neuron damage or reflects an axonal process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-polio-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-polio syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, the consequences of diaphragmatic paralysis are often magnified by the rapidity of onset and coexistent weakness of other ventilatory muscles.

However, occasionally the diaphragm is disproportionately affected.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adult patients with acid maltase deficiency typically present with progressive proximal muscle weakness in a limb girdle distribution with associated diaphragmatic involvement leading to respiratory insufficiency. The diagnosis is made by characteristic electromyogram changes.

This dysfunction is reversible with refeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis occurs as an anticipated consequence of a known neuromuscular disease. Patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis as the primary manifestation of their disease typically present with dyspnea that worsens in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/12,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22</a>]. This symptom is frequently misinterpreted as a sign of heart failure, but the evaluation for cardiac disease is negative. These processes can be differentiated in most patients as the onset of orthopnea from bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is dramatic, occurring within minutes of recumbency, and associated with tachypnea and rapid shallow breathing. In contrast, orthopnea due to heart failure usually develops more gradually over the course of the night. Patients with bilateral diaphragm paralysis also complain of daytime fatigue, probably due to poor sleep and increased work of breathing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Close observation of the breathing pattern reveals tachypnea and paradoxical abdominal wall retraction (instead of normal protrusion) during inspiration due to elevation of the anterior rib cage by accessory muscles, best appreciated when the patient is supine. Care must be taken in assessing abdominal wall motion in patients who are actively exhaling. In these individuals, contraction of the lateral oblique abdominal muscles during expiration and subsequent relaxation of these muscles as an assistance to inspiration may give the appearance of outward motion of the anterior abdominal wall during inspiration. Additional insight regarding diaphragm function may be obtained by palpating under the costal margins to feel for the descending hemidiaphragms during inspiration, manifest by caudad motion of the upper quadrant organs.</p><p>Hypoxemia is a common finding in bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, due primarily to the atelectasis that results from the inability to fully expand the lungs. Atelectasis causes ventilation-perfusion mismatching and hypoxemia, which worsens with sleep when the patient is in the recumbent position.</p><p>Disease progression is associated with progressive hypercapnia and hypoxemia, which are most evident during sleep and most commonly occur in patients with an underlying systemic neuromuscular disease. Morning headaches, confusion, and signs of cor pulmonale can occur in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Frank ventilatory failure, severe pulmonary hypertension, and secondary erythrocytosis may dominate the clinical picture in the most severe cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57872\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57872 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is suspected clinically on the basis of dyspnea and orthopnea, a chest radiograph and pulmonary function tests are typically obtained to exclude other causes of dyspnea and to assess the severity of impairment. Neither study is completely diagnostic for diaphragmatic paralysis. The need for further testing varies with the clinical setting. Clinical observation, sitting and supine spirometry, and measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures may be sufficient to establish the diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in patients with generalized neuromuscular disease. In comparison, measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressures or performance of a diaphragmatic electromyography, with or without phrenic nerve stimulation, may be necessary in those cases in which the diagnosis is in question or the patient is being considered for diaphragmatic pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3303894\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests (eg, creatine&nbsp;kinase [CK], aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], antinuclear antibody, cerebrospinal fluid examination) are chosen based on whether generalized muscle weakness is present and whether the etiology is known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;, section on 'Clinical investigations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26028691\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An upright, inspiratory chest radiograph is obtained to assess the position and contour of the diaphragm and to exclude parenchymal lung processes that might be causing the patient's dyspnea. Normally, the dome of the right hemidiaphragm projects anteriorly over the fifth or sixth rib and posteriorly over the tenth rib, and the dome of the left hemidiaphragm is up to one interspace lower than the right. With bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, bilateral, smooth elevation of the hemidiaphragms and small lung volumes are usually seen, and the costophrenic and costovertebral sulci are deep and narrow. The lateral view confirms a smooth contour and elevated diaphragmatic position. Plate-like atelectasis may also be present, usually at the lung base.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic elevation on the plain chest radiograph includes subpulmonic effusions, pleural adhesions, obesity with decreased chest wall and abdominal compliance, and subdiaphragmatic processes such as ascites, organomegaly, and ileus.</p><p>Fluoroscopy can be misleading in bilateral diaphragm paralysis because the cephalad movement of the ribs as the accessory muscles contract may give the false appearance of caudad displacement of the diaphragm. This limitation is <strong>not</strong> seen in unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, where the sniff fluoroscopy test is positive in over 90 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults#H17481178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and eventration in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)

When pleural effusion or thickening is suspected, and not diagnosed by simpler methods, CT scanning might be useful. CT scan of the abdomen can help to exclude subdiaphragmatic causes of diaphragm elevation.</p><p>Measurement of diaphragmatic thickness by ultrasonography has been used in a small series to confirm diaphragmatic paralysis and to assess recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the small field of view and obscuration of the diaphragm by intervening lung or bowel air make assessment of diaphragm function difficult. This technique requires operator expertise and its role in the assessment of diaphragmatic paralysis is unclear.</p><p>Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax, in which sequentially obtained still pictures are arranged in a way that reveals dynamic changes, may eventually prove to be more useful than still MRI in the evaluation of diaphragmatic paralysis, but is not part of the routine evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26028698\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important pulmonary function test in the patient with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is measurement of the vital capacity (VC) in the upright and supine positions. Normal recumbency results in up to a 10 percent decrease in the VC compared to the upright value. In contrast, patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis show a 50 percent decrease in the VC when they are supine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This is due to a cephalad displacement of abdominal contents without the normal concomitant increase in diaphragmatic tone.

The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) reflects the strength of the diaphragm. Patients with diaphragmatic dysfunction or paralysis have decreased MIPs. This is especially true in those with systemic or generalized neuromuscular disease. The MIP in patients with bilateral diaphragm paralysis is lower (less negative) than -60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Rarely, the MIP is normal in patients with isolated diaphragmatic paralysis because of preserved strength of the accessory muscles. The MEP is usually normal, but may be mildly reduced, as it is measured at full inspiration and patients with diaphragmatic paralysis are unable to achieve full inspiration. The ratio of MEP over MIP <span class=\"nowrap\">(MEP/MIP)</span> &gt;2 has been useful as a screening test for diaphragmatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The diaphragmatic EMG is recorded with either esophageal or surface electrodes and may show either a neuropathic or a myopathic pattern, depending on the etiology of the paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29</a>].

In adults, the distance between the nostril and the tip of the balloon is 35 to 40 cm for the esophageal balloon and 50 to 60 cm for the gastric balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The Pdi is the difference between Ppl and Pga (Pdi = Ppl &ndash; Pga). The Pdi can be measured at rest, during tidal breathing (Pdi) at end inspiration or end expiration, with voluntary maneuvers such as a deep breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], a sniff (sniff Pdi) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], or a maximal inspiratory force maneuver with airflow limited by a partially closed shutter (Pdi-max) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/11,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,35</a>]. At peak tidal volume inspiration, the value for Pdi is negative in diaphragm paralysis, but positive if the diaphragm is working normally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80120\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80120 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>The normal value for Pdi depends upon the method used to obtain it. Reliability is also an issue since there is great variation even in the same individual. In an attempt to avert this problem, Pdi may be measured independent of the patient's effort. This is done by electrically stimulating the phrenic nerve and measuring the twitch Pdi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>As with EMG, expertise is needed in the performance and interpretation of these tests. In experienced hands, measurement of the Pdi can be extremely useful in differentiating diaphragmatic paralysis from other causes of respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3303909\"><span class=\"h3\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis often report dyspnea with recumbency and disturbed sleep. As patients with ventilatory disorders may have a coexistent sleep related disorder of breathing that would require an alternate therapeutic approach, we typically obtain overnight polysomnography prior to or at the same time as initiating noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79606\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79606 \">table 3</a>).

Diaphragmatic paralysis can involve either the whole diaphragm (bilateral) or only one leaflet (unilateral). The causes and diagnosis of unilateral diaphragm paralysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normal diaphragm function'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-unilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis-and-eventration-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and eventration in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis typically present with dyspnea that worsens in the supine position. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On physical examination, close observation of the breathing pattern reveals tachypnea and paradoxical abdominal wall retraction (instead of normal protrusion) during inspiration, best appreciated when the patient is supine. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred diagnostic approach to the patient with suspected bilateral diaphragm paralysis varies with the clinical setting. Clinical observation, sitting and supine spirometry, and measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures may be sufficient to establish the diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in patients with generalized neuromuscular disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On an upright, inspiratory chest radiograph, bilateral, smooth elevation of the hemidiaphragms and small lung volumes are usually seen, and the costophrenic and costovertebral sulci are deep and narrow. The lateral view confirms a smooth contour and elevated diaphragmatic position. (See <a href=\"#H26028691\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroscopy can be misleading in bilateral diaphragm paralysis because the cephalad movement of the ribs as the accessory muscles contract may give the false appearance of caudad displacement of the diaphragm. (See <a href=\"#H26028691\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of the vital capacity (VC) in the upright and supine positions is useful in recognition of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Normal recumbency results in up to a 10 percent decrease in the VC compared to the upright value. In contrast, recumbency in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis results in a 50 percent decrease in the VC. (See <a href=\"#H26028698\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gold standard for the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis is the objective measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). However, this testing is not usually necessary unless the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis is in question. (See <a href=\"#H26028725\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically obtain overnight polysomnography prior to or at the same time as initiating nocturnal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), as patients with ventilatory disorders may have a coexistent sleep disturbances that require an alternate therapeutic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79606\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79606 \">table 3</a>).
