Patients with an acute overdose of NSAIDs often present to emergency departments and represent a sizable percentage of cases reported to regional poison centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As aging populations have increasingly come to rely on NSAIDs, chronic toxicity and acute poisonings have become more commonplace. Given the relative frequency of toxic NSAID exposures, emergency and primary care clinicians need to understand the diagnosis and management of this poisoning.</p><p>Acute NSAID poisoning is reviewed here. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59428 \">table 1</a>). A general approach to suspected drug intoxication and discussions of chronic NSAID toxicity are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76922 \">figure 1</a>). NSAIDs prevent COX-mediated production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes but not leukotrienes and other eicosanoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. The constitutive enzyme, COX-1, is expressed in most tissues and enables regulation of basal cellular homeostasis (platelet function, gastric mucosal integrity, and regulation of renal blood flow). The activity of the inducible COX-2 isoenzyme increases in inflammatory and pain states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Numerous animal and human studies have demonstrated the role of COX-1 in inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In general, all NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms, with most adverse reactions believed to be attributable to COX-1 inhibition. The development of newer COX-2 selective NSAIDs arose from the desire to maintain therapeutic antiinflammatory function, while decreasing the rates of adverse drug effects, most notably gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral absorption of NSAIDs approaches 100 percent and peak serum levels usually occur within one to two hours. Large toxic ingestions or concomitant food consumption can delay peak levels up to three to four hours. NSAIDs are weak acids that are extensively (up to 99 percent) protein bound, with a small volume of distribution (0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span>. Diseases causing low protein levels or large NSAID ingestions can decrease plasma protein binding, resulting in an increased volume of distribution and greater penetration into body tissues, including the central nervous system. </p><p>Most NSAIDs are metabolized by hepatic biotransformation with urinary excretion. The elimination half-life is usually less than 8 hours, but it ranges from 1 to 50 hours depending on the specific class and initial dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The half-lives of some common NSAIDs are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short half-life (&lt;8 hours): <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long half-life (&gt;8 hours): <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (9 to 20 hours), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaprozin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaprozin</a> (25 to 50 hours), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a> (30 to 86 hours), phenylbutazone (50 to 100 hours)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important historical information includes the name of the NSAID ingested, the amount ingested, the time of ingestion, and the presence of coingestants. Nausea, vomiting, and non-specific neurologic findings such as dizziness may occur. Patients should be specifically questioned about their use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, as these are commonly mistaken for NSAIDs and can produce significant toxicity.</p><p>The physical examination in NSAID-poisoned patients is usually unremarkable or nonspecific. Severe poisoning may produce an acute alteration in mental status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASPECTS OF ACUTE TOXICITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of acute NSAID overdose tend to be minimal. In a review of over 5000 NSAID overdoses, the most common signs and symptoms were nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Less than 0.5 percent of these patients experienced severe harm (eg, renal failure); most required no medical intervention. </p><p>In general, ingestions of less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of most NSAIDs (except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a> and phenylbutazone) are unlikely to cause any significant toxicity. Massive overdoses that produce severe clinical toxicity are seen with ingestions greater than approximately 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (lean body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hypothermia may develop following a large overdose, and has been reported in a child with a therapeutic dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid base abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased anion gap metabolic acidosis may be seen after large ingestions of NSAIDs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, and phenylbutazone (a veterinary NSAID occasionally ingested by humans). This acidosis may represent a combination of lactic acidosis (from cellular hypoxia or seizures) and weakly acidic NSAID metabolites. Cardiac dysrhythmias and electrolyte abnormalities are thought to be due to the severe anion gap metabolic (lactic) acidosis resulting from massive NSAID ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>].<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute renal failure and renal papillary necrosis are rare in NSAID overdose. Most commonly, these pathologic processes occur in patients with decreased effective arterial volume (heart failure, cirrhosis, protracted hypovolemia), age-related underlying renal dysfunction, or massive overdose.</p><p>Patients with NSAID-induced acute renal failure usually present with evidence of decreasing renal function (increased serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, decreased urine volume, or weight gain). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute renal papillary necrosis may be more difficult. Patients classically present with gross hematuria and renal colic, secondary to ureteral passage of sluffed ischemic renal tissue. To confirm the diagnosis, the clinician must inquire specifically about a recent large ingestion of NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-analgesic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NSAID-induced renal injury likely results from inhibition of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Prostaglandin inhibition leads to vasoconstriction and decreased renal perfusion. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy usually reverses the renal insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14820553\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypotension and cardiovascular collapse have been reported following massive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one case, a 14-year-old male with an intentional overdose of approximately 50 g of ibuprofen developed refractory hypotension, in addition to gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure but was successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

A prospective study looking at <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> overdose noted that 30 percent of patients experienced CNS effects ranging from drowsiness to coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Case reports have identified numerous neurologic sequelae including ataxia, nystagmus, headaches, and disorientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Seizures have been reported with ingestions of propionic acids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>), pyrazolones (phenylbutazone), acetic acids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>), and anthranilic acids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclofenamate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meclofenamate</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. Most cases occurred after large ingestions, but even small therapeutic doses have been associated with seizures in certain patients. The mechanism by which NSAIDs cause seizures is not clear. Some speculate that decreased cerebral prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis may lower the seizure threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematological toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been associated with the use of phenylbutazone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one case of aplastic anemia, the patient presented with bleeding gums and a diffuse petechial rash after ingestion of an herbal supplement containing phenylbutazone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Phenylbutazones were removed from United States markets in the 1970s, but they are still available in veterinary formulations and in other countries. Discontinuation of the drug has been shown to reverse the hematologic disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs may cause several types of allergic reactions, particularly in patients with chronic urticaria or asthma. Symptoms can range in severity from a worsening of chronic urticaria to full anaphylaxis. The management of anaphylaxis due to NSAID ingestion is the same as that of anaphylaxis from any cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with apparent allergic reactions to NSAID or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should discontinue all NSAIDs until they have been specifically evaluated for this problem.

Concentrations correlate poorly with symptoms, rarely return in a timely fashion, and are not clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. </p><p>Routine measurement of renal function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and serum creatinine) is not indicated in patients with minor, asymptomatic ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, in symptomatic patients or those with massive ingestions, measurement of baseline renal function as well as serum electrolytes is prudent. A complete blood count to determine the hemoglobin and platelet levels is appropriate in patients with NSAID-induced bleeding. In massive ingestion (approximately &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in a child or &gt;6 g in an adult) or when the etiology of mental status alteration is unknown, we recommend obtaining an arterial blood gas to determine acid-base status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H843407073\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of NSAID poisoning is made on the basis of the history. In the large majority of NSAID poisoning cases, symptoms and signs are nonspecific, and often mild. The most common signs and symptoms are nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1193809937\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected overdose can be a challenge for even the most experienced clinician. With an unreliable patient or an unclear history, the goal of the treating clinician is to construct a broad differential and ensure critical interventions are performed in a timely manner. These management issues are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medications commonly coingested or mistaken for NSAIDs, namely salicylic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with purported NSAID poisoning. Both aspirin and acetaminophen are potentially lethal in overdose. Initial manifestations of acetaminophen toxicity are often mild, but poisoning can be determined through serial laboratory testing using an accepted nomogram. Early symptoms of acute aspirin toxicity include tinnitus, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea; subsequent symptoms portending a more severe intoxication include altered mental status (ranging from agitation to lethargy), hyperpyrexia, noncardiac pulmonary edema, and coma. In addition to clinical signs, salicylate toxicity can be diagnosed with laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosing a large, acute overdose of NSAIDs can be challenging in the absence of a history of the exposure. Patients presenting with altered mental status should be evaluated in a step wise manner, as is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complications of acute NSAID ingestion (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal injury, seizures) may manifest without a clear history of ingestion, but these can be successfully treated with standard supportive measures.

However, apnea and hypotension are rare so aggressive intervention is usually unnecessary. In the unusual circumstance where intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary, it is important to adjust the ventilator appropriately to help compensate for any underlying acidosis.

Aspiration risk, including mental status and the ability to protect the airway, must be assessed in all patients before any attempts to administer AC. </p><p>Multiple doses of AC (MDAC) are thought to be ineffective in acute NSAID ingestion because of the low enterohepatic recirculation and high protein binding of the majority of these drugs. Although certain NSAIDs have increased enterohepatic circulation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a>), no clinical studies have demonstrated a benefit from MDAC, and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology does not recommend its use in the treatment of NSAID overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, MDAC may be useful in patients with a massive overdose of a sustained release NSAID. In such cases, consultation with a medical toxicologist or regional poison control center is prudent.

Although we suggest the early use of crystalloid to correct volume depletion, we do not suggest routine use of bicarbonate therapy because of the lack of data demonstrating efficacy. Multiple case reports describe bicarbonate infusion as a temporizing measure for severe acidosis following massive NSAID ingestion. However, given the lack of evidence supporting this therapy, we recommend consultation with a poison control center or medical toxicologist before initiating treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drug-nsaid-poisoning/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].

Despite high rates of acute NSAID overdose, few patients experience poor outcomes, and most require no medical intervention or supportive care alone. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59428 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and examination findings in NSAID intoxication are generally nonspecific. The most common signs and symptoms are nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness. Patients should be specifically questioned about their use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, as these are commonly mistaken for NSAIDs but can cause severe toxicity and may be life-threatening in overdose. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate serum concentrations should be obtained in all patients with suspected NSAID poisoning. In symptomatic patients and those with large ingestions, tests of renal function (BUN, serum creatinine), serum electrolytes, and an arterial blood gas should be obtained. In bleeding patients, hemoglobin and platelet counts should be measured. NSAID serum concentrations are generally not helpful. (See <a href=\"#H5178851\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAID ingestions of less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> are unlikely to cause significant symptoms in adults; ingestions greater than approximately 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (lean body weight) can cause severe symptoms. An increased anion gap metabolic acidosis may be seen after large ingestions, particularly those involving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, and phenylbutazone. Renal failure and renal papillary necrosis are rare and occur most often in patients with decreased effective arterial volume, age-related underlying renal dysfunction, or massive overdose. Acute central nervous system toxicity related to NSAID use is pervasive and clinical manifestations are varied, ranging from drowsiness to seizure to coma. NSAIDs may cause anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, particularly in patients with chronic urticaria or asthma. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical aspects of acute toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with NSAID overdose, the clinician's first responsibility is to secure the airway, breathing, and circulation. Aggressive intervention is usually unnecessary. We suggest gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) in patients who present within two hours of an acute ingestion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Aspiration risk should be assessed in all patients before any attempts to administer AC. No antidote exists. Extracorporeal removal is ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of acute toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with minor ingestions who are asymptomatic and not suicidal may be discharged safely after a four to six-hour period of observation, depending upon the agent ingested. Suicidal patients, patients who manifest signs of severe intoxication (eg, pH &lt;7.3, acute renal dysfunction, altered mental status), and those with other medical or psychosocial concerns should be admitted. A 24-hour period of observation is recommended in cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a> and phenylbutazone ingestions.
