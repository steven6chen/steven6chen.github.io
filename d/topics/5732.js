Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are particularly susceptible to dynamic hyperinflation. Common questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What causes dynamic hyperinflation?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are its clinical manifestations?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is it diagnosed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the treatment?</p><p/><p>The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD are reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During normal exercise, end-expiratory lung volumes remain stable despite the increase in tidal volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69862\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69862 \">figure 1</a>), because the tidal volume is completely exhaled prior to the initiation of the next breath. Maintenance of stable lung volumes requires that expiratory muscles be recruited to elevate pleural and alveolar pressure, increase expiratory flow, and force the increased tidal volume to be completely exhaled prior to the next breath. Dynamic hyperinflation occurs when airflow limitation prevents complete exhalation and results in an increase in end-expiratory lung volume, usually in the setting of the increased tidal volume associated with exercise or other causes of hyperpnea. &#160;</p><p>In general, hyperinflation acts as a compensatory mechanism. At higher lung volumes, there is decreased airway resistance and increased elastic recoil, resulting in improved expiratory flow. Two types of hyperinflation can be distinguished: static and dynamic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Static hyperinflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elastic recoil pressure decreases during expiration, reaching zero at the end-expiratory lung volume. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) have decreased elastic recoil pressure compared to healthy patients; therefore, the elastic recoil pressure falls to zero at a larger end-expiratory lung volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63226 \">figure 2</a>). This is referred to as static hyperinflation, which exists at rest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dynamic hyperinflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to healthy individuals, patients with COPD recruit expiratory muscles and increase their pleural and alveolar pressures during exercise, in an effort to increase expiratory flow and completely exhale the increased tidal volume prior to the next breath. However, the airways of patients with COPD typically compress or collapse when the pleural pressure is positive, thereby preventing increased expiratory flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As a result, exhalation may not be completed prior to the onset of the next breath, causing progressive hyperinflation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63226 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This is referred to as dynamic hyperinflation; it occurs during exercise and can exist in the presence or absence of static hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. </p><p>Dynamic hyperinflation limits ventilation during exercise and can negatively impact cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Studies have suggested that hyperinflation may compromise cardiac output, and intervention studies that demonstrate improvement in cardiac function after interventions to reduce dynamic hyperinflation support this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal symptom of dynamic hyperinflation is dyspnea on exertion. Although hyperinflation is a compensatory mechanism that increases expiratory flow, it increases the work of breathing, places the inspiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage due to length-tension effects, and produces a positive alveolar pressure that must be overcome to initiate a breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The net effect is a marked disparity between the level of inspiratory effort (approaches maximum) and the actual mechanical response of the respiratory system (greatly diminished tidal volume), which manifests as dyspnea, initially with exertion and later at rest.</p><p>Dyspnea with exertion is a nonspecific complaint in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additional causes of dyspnea with exertion include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dynamic airway compression due to increased pleural pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory muscle weakness due to chronic disease and mechanical disadvantage of hyperinflation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased ventilatory demand due to physiologic dead space, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, early onset lactic acidosis, deconditioning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor nutrition</p><p/><p>The occurrence of dynamic hyperinflation is not clearly predicted by the severity of COPD (based on the reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second), as patients with the most severe COPD tend to have less dynamic hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is possible that the degree of baseline hyperinflation in severe COPD inhibits further dynamic hyperinflation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dynamic hyperinflation may be suspected in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who experience dyspnea on exertion. Definitive diagnosis of dynamic hyperinflation requires lung volume measurements during exercise. This is time consuming, labor intensive, and technically difficult. Therefore, indirect measures using spirometry are more common. There are two methods of indirect measurement: measurement of inspiratory capacity (decreases with dynamic hyperinflation) and comparison of flow-volume loops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspiratory capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperinflation is defined as an elevated end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Decreased inspiratory capacity (IC) is used as a surrogate measure of increased EELV. This is based upon the assumption that total lung capacity (TLC) is constant; therefore, an increase of the EELV must be accompanied by a decrease of the IC since the sum of the two measures is the total lung capacity (ie, EELV + IC = TLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>During exercise, healthy individuals increase their tidal volume. To insure that the entire tidal volume is exhaled prior to their next breath, they recruit expiratory muscles and increase their expiratory flow, which results in an increased IC and decreased EELV. In contrast, patients with COPD are unable to sufficiently increase their expiratory flow and completely exhale the increased tidal volume prior to the next breath; as a result, the IC decreases and the EELV increases during exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63226 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77593\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77593 \">figure 3</a>). Progressive decrease of IC during exercise is highly suggestive of dynamic hyperinflation.</p><p>In an observational study of 22 subjects with moderately severe COPD, inspiratory capacity was monitored every two minutes during a six minute walk test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. During the first two minutes of the test, tidal volume increased, suggesting that dyspnea during that time frame was due to increased respiratory effort. Subsequently, the increase in dyspnea correlated with a progressive decrease in inspiratory capacity without further increase in tidal volume, suggesting that dynamic hyperinflation contributed to dyspnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow-volume loops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another method compares the maximal flow-volume loop (MFVL) versus the tidal flow-volume loop during exercise (extFVL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In healthy individuals, the extFVL and the MFVL are distinct, whereas the flow-volume loops become increasingly similar (ie, there is encroachment of the extFVL on the MFVL) with an increasing EELV as dynamic hyperinflation progresses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63226 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The MFVL is obtained by spirometry with the patient resting prior to exercise, while the extFVL is obtained at several different work intensities during exercise. Either a single representative extFVL or the mean of two or more extFLVs is plotted within the largest MFVL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63226 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Since bronchodilation or bronchoconstriction may occur during exercise, additional MFVLs are often obtained during or immediately after exercise. IC is also determined during rest and exercise, and then used to correctly align the extFVL within the MFVL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394093185\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyspnea on exertion cannot be assumed to be due to dynamic hyperinflation, as patients with COPD may have dyspnea due to other processes related to COPD, including the work of overcoming airflow limitation and secondary pulmonary hypertension. In addition, comorbidities related to COPD may be contributory, such as coronary heart disease, heart failure (with or without preserved ejection fraction), deconditioning, and fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-prognostic-factors-and-comorbid-conditions#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Prognostic factors and comorbid conditions&quot;, section on 'Comorbid diseases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with COPD, small decreases in end-expiratory lung volume are often associated with significant clinical improvement, suggesting that hyperinflation is a significant cause of dyspnea. Reduction of hyperinflation can be achieved by multiple approaches, and combination treatments have been shown to have additive benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Bronchodilator pharmacotherapy can reduce airways resistance and increase expiratory flow; heliox also decreases airways resistance; supplemental oxygen and exercise rehabilitation can reduce ventilatory drive; and lung volume reduction interventions change lung mechanics to reduce hyperinflation. Studies of interventions to improve dynamic hyperinflation suggest that clinical improvement results from not only respiratory mechanics but also improvements in cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2347663763\"><span class=\"h2\">Decrease airflow obstruction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticholinergic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticholinergic agents produce sustained reductions in hyperinflation during rest and exercise, resulting in improved exercise capacity and reduced dyspnea with exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This was best illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a double-blind, cross-over study, 29 patients with stable COPD performed spirometry and exercise before and one hour after receiving nebulized ipratropium bromide (500 mcg) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The inspiratory capacity at rest increased 14 percent following ipratropium, consistent with decreased static hyperinflation. This was accompanied by improved exercise endurance and dyspnea during exercise. There were no significant changes in spirometry, exercise endurance, or exertional dyspnea after receiving placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double-blind, parallel-group trial randomly assigned 187 patients with COPD to receive tiotropium (18 mcg) or placebo once daily for 42 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, exercise endurance, and exertional dyspnea of the tiotropium group were compared to the placebo group. Tiotropium increased the inspiratory capacity and decreased the end-expiratory lung volume at rest, consistent with decreased static hyperinflation. In addition, tiotropium increased exercise capacity and improved exertional dyspnea.</p><p/><p>However, not all studies have shown a reduction in dynamic hyperinflation with tiotropium. In a study of 29 patients with moderate-severe COPD, tiotropium significantly increased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and inspiratory capacity (IC), independent of the extent of the lung computed tomography emphysema score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Spirometry including IC was measured before and immediately after metronome paced hyperventilation at twice the resting respiratory rate for 20 seconds to induce dynamic hyperinflation. Despite bronchodilation and lower resting lung volume, tiotropium did not abbreviate dynamic hyperinflation, which was also independent of the degree of underlying emphysema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta-agonists similarly decrease static hyperinflation, allowing greater dynamic hyperinflation during exercise before intolerable dyspnea develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This was best illustrated by a double-blind, crossover study that randomly assigned 23 patients with COPD to receive salmeterol (50 mcg) or placebo twice daily for two weeks, and then compared spirometry and exercise capacity in the salmeterol group versus the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Salmeterol increased the inspiratory capacity during rest and exercise, consistent with decreased static and dynamic hyperinflation. It also increased exercise endurance and decreased dyspnea during exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Combination beta-agonist and inhaled glucocorticoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined long-acting beta-agonist plus inhaled glucocorticoid decreases hyperinflation and improves exercise endurance. This was illustrated in a trial of 185 patients with COPD who were randomly assigned to receive placebo, salmeterol alone (50 mcg), or fluticasone (250 mcg) plus salmeterol (50 mcg) twice daily for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Compared with placebo, combination therapy increased the inspiratory capacity during rest and exercise, consistent with decreased static and dynamic hyperinflation. It also increased exercise endurance. Static hyperinflation was the only outcome for which combination therapy and salmeterol were compared, with combination therapy demonstrating a greater impact.</p><p>Inhaled glucocorticoids alone enhance bronchodilator-mediated improvement of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, it is unknown whether this observation is due to improvement in dynamic hyperinflation. Monotherapy with inhaled glucocorticoids is not recommended for COPD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2956822866\"><span class=\"h3\">Theophylline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While uncommonly used for this purpose, theophylline decreases hyperinflation and increases exercise capacity in a dose-dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial, 38 patients with COPD received placebo, low-dose, medium-dose, or high-dose theophylline consecutively for two months each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Spirometry, lung volumes, and exercise were performed at the end of each two month treatment period. There was a dose dependent decrease in lung volumes and increase in exercise capacity, accompanied by a modest improvement in dyspnea. An effect of theophylline to improve respiratory muscle function has also been hypothesized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-methylxanthines-in-the-treatment-of-copd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of methylxanthines in the treatment of COPD&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514349837\"><span class=\"h3\">Heliox</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another approach to reducing airflow limitation is to decrease the density of gas exhaled through obstructed airways, as occurs when breathing a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox). While heliox is not available for routine use during exercise, study of its effects adds to our understanding of dynamic hyperinflation. The addition of helium decreases turbulence within medium and large airways and increases expiratory flow. </p><p>As an example, a crossover trial randomly assigned 10 patients to breathe room air (ie, 21 percent oxygen), hyperoxic air (40 percent oxygen), normoxic helium (21 percent oxygen plus 79 percent helium), or hyperoxic helium (40 percent oxygen plus 60 percent helium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. All three gases improved exercise duration and dyspnea compared with room air, although only the helium-containing gases improved the inspiratory capacity during exercise (ie, decreased dynamic hyperinflation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-use-of-heliox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical use of heliox&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1938864832\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce ventilatory load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One way to reduce dynamic hyperinflation is to decrease the ventilatory drive, which reduces the respiratory rate and prolongs expiratory time. Supplemental oxygen may decrease both the metabolic demand at a given workload and also influence the neural drive to breathe. Pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise training at submaximal intensities can improve endurance and reduce the ventilatory demand for a given level of exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4009144740\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen therapy is well known to be beneficial in patients with COPD and hypoxemia. It also appears to decrease dynamic hyperinflation, even in patients who are not hypoxemic with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This was best illustrated by an observational study of 10 patients with COPD who underwent spirometry and exercise testing while receiving different concentrations of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Compared with room air, hyperinflation was progressively reduced when breathing 30 and 50 percent oxygen. There was no additional reduction of hyperinflation when the patients breathed 75 or 100 percent oxygen. Similarly, a randomized trial demonstrated faster resolution of dynamic hyperinflation following exercise among patients who received oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While of interest in a research setting, supplemental oxygen at these levels carries the risk of hypercapnia and is not advised for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951508825\"><span class=\"h3\">Rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rehabilitative exercise training generally yields the greatest improvement in exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At least part of this improved exercise capacity is due to reduced dynamic hyperinflation. An observational study evaluated dynamic hyperinflation in 24 patients with COPD following a seven week training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Inspiratory capacity dropped less precipitously and exercise capacity increased following the training program, suggesting that dynamic hyperinflation was less, although still present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A preliminary study found that nasal positive expiratory pressure (PEP) during exercise reduced dynamic hyperinflation and increased six-minute walk distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Further study is needed to determine whether PEP could enhance endurance training in COPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung volume reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung volume reduction can be performed surgically (LVRS) or bronchoscopically (BLVR).

Postbronchodilator TLC was measured at each visit (prior to surgery and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months). During a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), IC was measured every two minutes and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) was calculated (EELV = TLC - IC). The main measure of DH was the <span class=\"nowrap\">EELV/TLC</span> ratio. Compared with the post-rehab (pre-LVRS) baseline, dynamic hyperinflation was significantly reduced at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after LVRS. Patients adopted a slower, deeper breathing pattern during exercise after LVRS, which strongly correlated with reductions in DH. Thus, improvements in dynamic hyperinflation appear to be durable for up to three years after LVRS. </p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BLVR using endobronchial valves prolongs exercise time by reducing dynamic hyperinflation. In an observational study, 19 patients with advanced COPD, who received unilateral valve insertion, were evaluated with spirometry, lung volumes, and exercise before and four weeks after BLVR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dynamic-hyperinflation-in-patients-with-copd/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. BLVR increased exercise capacity and decreased end-expiratory lung volume, during rest and exercise, compared to baseline.

Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or NAC 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for six weeks, followed by a two-week washout period, and then a cross over to alternate therapy for six weeks. Based on increases in IC, FVC, and endurance with NAC, NAC treatment appeared to reduce dynamic hyperinflation, probably due to a reduction in air trapping. However, routine long-term use of oral acetylcysteine is not recommended for COPD because of the minimal potential therapeutic benefit, the inconvenience of therapy, and potential side effects.

Static hyperinflation exists at rest and is predominantly due to decreased elastic recoil. Dynamic hyperinflation is induced by exercise and is primarily due to impaired expiratory flow. Dynamic hyperinflation may occur in the absence of static hyperinflation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea with exertion is the most common manifestation of dynamic hyperinflation. Dynamic hyperinflation can also occur during hyperpnea from other causes, such as an exacerbation of COPD, anxiety, pain, or mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct diagnosis of dynamic hyperinflation requires lung volume measurements during exercise. Due to the technical difficulties of measuring lung volumes during exercise, spirometric techniques are more commonly used. Progressive decrease of the inspiratory capacity during exercise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> similarity of the exercise and maximal flow-volume loops suggest dynamic hyperinflation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapies commonly used in the management of COPD that have been shown to improve static <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dynamic hyperinflation include anticholinergic drugs, beta-agonists, theophylline, supplemental oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lung volume reduction.
