Uveal melanoma comprises approximately 95 percent of melanomas arising from the eye, with the remainder arising from the conjunctiva.</p><p>The molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of metastatic uveal melanoma are discussed here. The initial management of uveal and conjunctival melanomas is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of uveal and conjunctival melanomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817983145\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molecular pathogenesis of uveal melanoma is incompletely understood but is distinct from that of cutaneous melanoma and other melanoma subtypes, including conjunctival melanoma. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma is genetically characterized by a small number of alterations. Advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis may eventually provide important opportunities for targeted therapy in patients with metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-molecular-biology-of-melanoma#H5643585\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The molecular biology of melanoma&quot;, section on 'MAPK pathway'</a>.) </p><p>Uveal melanoma is characterized by a low mutational burden, with approximately 2000 predicted somatic single-nucleotide variants per tumor and low levels of aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, uveal melanoma does not harbor recurrent mutations in <em>BRAF</em> or <em>NRAS</em> as are present in cutaneous disease. Rather, recurrent alterations in <em>GNAQ</em>, <em>GNA11</em>, <em>BAP1</em>, <em>PLCB4</em>, <em>CYSLTR2</em>, <em>SF3B1</em>, and <em>EIF1AX</em> are observed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>GNAQ </em>and <em>GNA11</em> are genes encoding for G protein alpha subunits and are mutated in over 90 percent of uveal melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These mutations lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway, in an analogous fashion to <em>BRAF</em> mutations in cutaneous melanoma, as well as the <span class=\"nowrap\">PI3K/AKT</span> pathway and <span class=\"nowrap\">Yap/Hippo</span> pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional mutations in <em>PLCB4</em> have been found in cases without <em>GNAQ</em> or <em>GNA11</em> mutations. <em>PLCB4</em> is a downstream effector of <em>GNAQ</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>GNA11</em></span> that was found to be mutated in 3 out of 28 uveal melanoma samples without <em>GNAQ</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>GNA11</em></span> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent activating mutations in the G protein coupled receptor <em>CYSLTR2</em> have been found in uveal melanoma without <em>GNAQ</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>GNA11</em></span> or <em>PCLB4</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <em>BAP1</em> gene is a nuclear deubiquitinase located on chromosome 3p21.1 that functions as a tumor suppressor and has an important role in transcription and the DNA damage response.

The most common initial sites of metastasis include the liver (60.5 percent), lung (24.4 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">skin/soft</span> tissue (10.9 percent), and bone (8.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients diagnosed with a primary uveal melanoma die of systemic metastases within five years of diagnosis, with 45 percent dead within 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Of those who develop metastases and die of uveal melanoma, 62 and 90 percent do so within 5 and 15 years of the original diagnosis, respectively. The extent of metastatic disease is incorporated into the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110766 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110765\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110765 \">table 2</a>), and its impact on overall survival is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112190 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The rarity of uveal melanoma has made it challenging to delineate the natural course and prognosis of patients with metastatic disease. A meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from phase <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/II</span> trials was conducted under the auspices of the International Rare Cancers Initiative (IRCI) Rare Melanoma Subgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Data were available from 968 patients treated in 29 studies conducted between 2000 and 2015:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response data (best response achieved on trial) were available for 796 patients; 5 (0.6 percent) and 77 (9.7 percent) achieved a complete response and a partial response, respectively. Stable disease was achieved in 368 patients (46 percent). Thus, clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, and stable disease) was seen in 450 patients (57 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.3 months (95% CI 2.9-3.6), with a PFS rate at six months of 27 percent (95% CI 24-30). Factors significantly associated with shorter PFS on multivariate analysis included male sex, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and increased diameter of the largest liver metastasis (&ge;44.5 versus &lt;44.5 mm). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.6-11.0), with a one-year overall survival rate of 43 percent (95% CI 40-47). Significant prognostic factors for shorter overall survival by multivariable analysis were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (&ge;1 versus 0), male sex, elevated LDH, elevated ALP, and larger diameter of the largest liver metastasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were numerically superior median PFS and overall survival for patients treated with liver-directed modalities; however, after adjusting for prognostic factors, only the PFS benefit of liver-directed therapies over other systemic regimens remained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H746925358\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in treatment of metastatic melanoma using targeted therapy and immunotherapy have led to prolongation of overall survival for patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. These approaches are being explored for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, but they do not have an established role in uveal melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H1165596880\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved systemic therapies for uveal melanoma in the adjuvant or metastatic settings, and no therapy has been shown to improve overall survival. As a result, there is no standard-of-care therapy, and participation in a clinical trial should be prioritized for patients with metastatic disease. </p><p>Although surgery or ablative procedures such as radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or stereotactic radiation therapy can be performed with curative intent in cases of oligometastatic disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], such cases are rare. There are no randomized trials that have compared metastasectomy or ablation with systemic therapy or best supportive care. A comprehensive review of the role of surgery in this setting suggested that patients who were able to have their liver metastases completely resected did better than patients for whom a complete resection was not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, only an estimated 2 to 7 percent of patients are candidates for resection of hepatic metastases, and the apparent improvement in survival may simply be a reflection of patient selection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-metastatic-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of metastatic melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A broad range of other treatment modalities have been evaluated to date, including systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and molecularly targeted agents for the MAPK pathway and others. In many patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, the predominant site of metastatic disease is the liver, and this has led to extensive evaluation of treatments targeting hepatic disease, such as bland embolization, chemoembolization, radioembolization, immunoembolization, and hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3354358429\" class=\"local\">'Liver-directed therapeutic strategies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3354358429\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER-DIRECTED THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with hepatic metastases, therapy directed specifically toward the liver metastases has been associated with responses that may have clinical utility. Some liver-directed therapies take advantage of the dual blood supply of the liver in order to deliver treatments more directly to the metastases through the hepatic artery. Recruited hepatic artery branches vascularize the melanoma, whereas portal circulation provides the majority of the blood to the normal liver tissue. Intrahepatic therapeutic approaches include bland embolization, intraarterial administration of chemotherapy, isolated hepatic perfusion, intraarterial hepatic chemoembolization, and immunoembolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Both fotemustine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> given by intrahepatic artery infusion have been compared with systemic chemotherapy in phase III trials. In both trials, no significant improvement in overall survival was observed despite differences in progression-free survival (PFS) or response rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fotemustine &ndash; In one trial, 171 patients with uveal melanoma and metastases limited to the liver were randomly assigned to fotemustine given either intraarterially or intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At a median follow-up of 1.6 years, 155 patients (91 percent) had died. Although there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS (median 4.5 versus 3.5 months), there was no improvement in overall survival with the intraarterial approach (median 14.6 versus 13.8 months, hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.79-1.50). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Melphalan</a> &ndash; In another trial, percutaneous hepatic perfusion of melphalan was compared with best alternative care in 93 patients with melanoma liver metastases. Approximately 89 percent of patients treated in this study had uveal melanoma. Hepatic PFS was significantly prolonged with the melphalan infusion (median 7.0 versus 1.6 months). However, there was no difference in overall survival (median 10.6 versus 10.0 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1165596880\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No therapy has been shown to improve overall survival for patients with uveal melanoma, and thus, there is no standard of care.

A subsequent phase III study of selumetinib and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> versus dacarbazine alone showed no improvement in either PFS or overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349223898\"><span class=\"h2\">Epigenetic therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that uveal melanoma is a genetically simple disease characterized by few somatic variants compared with cutaneous melanoma, other factors, such as epigenetic alterations, may be important in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma. </p><p>Preclinical data in uveal melanoma cell lines support the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in reversing the phenotypic and biochemical cell changes associated with <em>BAP1</em> loss and metastatic potential in uveal melanoma cells, with induction of G1 cell-cycle arrest, melanocytic differentiation, and gene-expression changes consistent with reversion to a class I phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Preclinical data suggest that epigenetic therapies targeting the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins may be a promising new strategy in uveal melanoma. JQ1, a first-generation BET inhibitor that competitively displaces BRD4 from acetylated histones, demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity in<em> GNAQ</em> and <em>GNA11 </em>mutant cell lines but not wild-type cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-metastatic-uveal-melanoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Microarray analysis of cell lines treated with JQ1 revealed changes in expression in genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and the DNA damage response. Interestingly, concomitant silencing of Bcl-xL and Rad51, regulators of apoptosis and the DNA damage response, respectively, was sufficient to induce apoptosis independent of Myc expression.</p><p>Studies of HDAC inhibitors and BET protein inhibitors are currently in clinical development for uveal melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2264399311\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with metastatic disease or who develop metastatic disease after treatment of their primary tumor, the prognosis is poor.
