Prior to the routine use of antifungal prophylaxis, <em>Candida</em> spp accounted for the majority of fungal infections that occurred during the preengraftment period of HCT, followed by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp. More recently, <em>Aspergillus</em> has surpassed <em>Candida</em> as a cause of invasive fungal infections in HCT recipients, associated with the use of effective antifungal prophylaxis targeting <em>Candida</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adult-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Prior to the routine use of antifungal prophylaxis, <em>Candida</em> spp accounted for the majority of fungal infections that occurred during the preengraftment period of HCT, followed by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp. HCT recipients are at highest risk for <em>Candida</em> infections during the preengraftment period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 1</a>). <em>Aspergillus</em> is the most common mold pathogen and the second most common fungal pathogen in HCT recipients, occurring most commonly during the postengraftment period in patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (See <a href=\"#H20422799\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20422813\" class=\"local\">'Candida infection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following recommendations represent our approach to antifungal prophylaxis. It should be noted that there is ongoing controversy about the use of antifungal prophylaxis. As a result, practices regarding antifungal prophylaxis differ widely at various cancer centers, and our approach may be different from the approach recommended at a specific institution. (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20422965\" class=\"local\">'Risk-benefit assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although antifungal prophylaxis has been proven to be efficacious in selected HCT recipients, issues surrounding overuse of antifungal agents (eg, resistance, toxicity, and cost) and the relatively low incidence of invasive fungal infections in these patients have tempered enthusiasm for universal prophylaxis. The risk-benefit analysis must include an assessment of the relative level of immunosuppression and comorbidities to identify those individuals at increased risk for invasive fungal infections. (See <a href=\"#H20422965\" class=\"local\">'Risk-benefit assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For recipients of myeloablative allogeneic HCT who do not have an indication for mold prophylaxis, we recommend prophylaxis against <em>Candida</em> infections during the preengraftment period rather than no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In such patients, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (200 or 400 mg once daily). (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For autologous HCT recipients who receive conditioning regimens that are expected to cause severe mucositis during the preengraftment period (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> plus either ablative doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> or total body irradiation), we suggest prophylaxis against <em>Candida</em> infections rather than no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such patients, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (200 or 400 mg once daily). (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who undergo myeloablative allogeneic HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia, we suggest anti-mold prophylaxis rather than narrower anti-<em>Candida</em> prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). When mold prophylaxis is indicated in an HCT recipient, we generally favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (200 mg orally twice daily), but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> is an appropriate alternative. (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the subset of HCT recipients with a lengthy duration of neutropenia immediately prior to HCT (eg, patients with aplastic anemia) and for those who are anticipated to have slow engraftment (&gt;28 days; eg, umbilical cord blood transplant recipients) or who fail to engraft, we suggest prophylaxis during the preengraftment period with an agent that has both anti-mold and anti-<em>Candida</em> activity rather than narrower anti-<em>Candida</em> prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such patients, we generally favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (200 mg orally twice daily), but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> is an appropriate alternative. (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the potential for serious drug interactions, administration of extended-spectrum triazole-based (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>) prophylaxis should be delayed until after completion of the transplant conditioning regimen; an echinocandin can be given safely during the conditioning regimen if a gap in antifungal coverage is unadvisable, such as in a patient with prior aspergillosis. Caution is advised for concomitant use of the extended-spectrum triazoles with chemotherapy drugs metabolized by the liver, especially those metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Recommendations about the timing of triazole administration in such patients are discussed below. Interactions between the anti-mold azoles and immunosuppressive drugs are substantial; reductions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> doses by 50 percent are important and monitoring of levels of these drugs is necessary to avoid toxicity. Coadministration with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> should be avoided due to extreme potentiation of sirolimus levels. (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20423021\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For allogeneic HCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at a dose of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (or the equivalent dose of another glucocorticoid) for longer than three weeks, we recommend anti-mold prophylaxis rather than no antifungal prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (200 mg orally twice daily) in such patients, but delayed-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> is an appropriate alternative. The same precautions regarding drug interactions that are discussed above must be considered. (See <a href=\"#H20422972\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a history of prior invasive aspergillosis undergoing allogeneic or autologous HCT and for patients with a prolonged period of neutropenia immediately prior to HCT, we recommend antifungal prophylaxis with a mold-active agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20422993\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H813221772\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Kieren A Marr, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adult-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kontoyiannis DP, Marr KA, Park BJ, et al.
