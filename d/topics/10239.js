These findings of effacement of gyral markings and patchy contrast enhancement appeared to colocalize with the source of the ictal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As MRI has become standard in the evaluation of patients with seizures and epilepsy, a growing range of periictal imaging findings have been described.

While most reported cases with these findings are status epilepticus or seizure clusters, these findings have also been described after single seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/6-9,11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,11,24</a>]. In one series of 69 patients with status epilepticus, 28 percent of patients had cortical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thalamic diffusion restriction on MRI that was deemed related to seizure based on clinical course and follow-up imaging; predictors of periictal changes included <span class=\"nowrap\">regional/unilateral</span> epileptiform discharges, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), and repetitive seizure patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Smaller series have documented DWI abnormalities in an even higher proportion of patients with focal status epilepticus (40 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/16,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26,27</a>].</p><p>In some cases, MRI changes are first apparent days or weeks after the start of focal status, suggesting that there may be a threshold of seizure duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity below which changes will not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. Other patient-specific variables may play a role, such as the seizure type and location, the duration and severity of ictal discharge, pharmacologic interventions, and the patient's age, comorbid conditions, and cardiovascular or metabolic reserve. In one small series, restricted diffusion on MRI was more likely with a neocortical rather than a medial temporal focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Periictal MRI findings usually resolve on follow-up imaging; however, residual T2 signal abnormalities can persist for several months, sometimes indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Focal atrophy in the region of T2 and DWI signal changes is also often reported on follow-up imaging, but these studies are usually compared with the periictal study, not a preictal baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3-5,7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7,28</a>]. This evolution of findings has also been documented in animal studies of induced epileptic seizures and suggests that these MRI findings are the result, not the cause, of the seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Case reports of these findings resolving with treatment and then reappearing with recurrent seizure activity also support this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>].</p><p>An exceptional case report documents a patient with multifocal epilepsy related to mitochondrial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Migratory T2 and DWI lesions appeared on serial MRI scans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63800\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63800 \">image 2</a>). These lesions corresponded to regions of focal hypermetabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62082\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62082 \">image 3</a>), as well as to areas of maximal electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality. This case provides further evidence that these MRI lesions are the consequence of the epileptic activity and not its cause.</p><p>DWI images may be misleading. For example, in patients presenting with paraneoplastic or autoimmune limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies against the leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, or the gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA-B) receptor, DWI imaging frequently shows increased signal in the limbic structures, but ADC maps can show normal diffusion coefficients or possibly &quot;pseudonormalization&quot; caused by T2 shine-through [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The absence of true diffusion restriction should raise the question of limbic encephalitis in patients presenting with recurrent seizures, behavioral changes, and increased T2 signal in limbic structures not accompanied by focal atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormalities of blood flow and perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perfusion-weighted MRI may show initial hyperperfusion in the area of ictal activity with subsequent relative hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,16,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,31</a>]. This temporal evolution is similar to that seen in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies that typically show focal ictal hyperperfusion with surrounding hypoperfusion, followed by postictal hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Postictal hypoperfusion on MRI can be confused with acute stroke. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Impact on clinical management'</a> below.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in patients with status epilepticus may demonstrate a reversible prominence of arterial branches in the region of the seizure focus, with corresponding increased flow-related enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78191\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78191 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3,5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,18</a>]. This finding corresponds with the observation of arterialization of venous blood reported by surgeons examining the cortex during provoked or spontaneous epileptic seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78191\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78191 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36</a>]. SPECT studies may not demonstrate corresponding ictal hyperperfusion; thus, some portion of the local increased blood flow observed on MRA may represent arteriovenous shunting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">REMOTE PERIICTAL MRI FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaschisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaschisis is a phenomenon of functional loss in an area of the brain that is anatomically remote from the primary lesion, but neuronally connected to it. This is most often described in the setting of stroke, but can also occur with a variety of cerebral pathologies including migraine, tumor, and encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis, in particular, is associated with lesions in the contralateral hemisphere. In acute injury, MRI evidence of diaschisis includes restricted diffusion and increased T2 signal. These findings typically normalize over time, although, with chronic injury, volume loss in these areas may occur.</p><p>Similar MRI findings have also been described in association with acute seizure activity. Restricted diffusion and increased T2 signal in the ipsilateral diencephalon and contralateral cerebellum have been prominent findings in a number of case reports of patients in both generalized and focal status epilepticus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58269\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58269 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3,5,12,13,16,18,21,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12,13,16,18,21,39-41</a>]. These lesions usually resolved over days to weeks with control of seizures, but may presage the appearance of local atrophy of the affected structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/13,21,38,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,38,40,42</a>]. The pathophysiology of these lesions is unknown, but presumably results from the recruitment and driving of connected thalamic and cerebellar circuits by the epileptic activity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum have been described in patients with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/43-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-51</a>]. These lesions are typically ovoid and well-circumscribed regions of increased T2 signal with restricted diffusion and resolve on follow-up imaging several weeks later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64710\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64710 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>]. In most cases, this finding appears to be clinically silent, although we have noted this finding in several patients who also had psychiatric disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Neither the mechanism nor the precise nature of the white matter change is understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Most cases are described in patients with clusters of seizures who have been rapidly withdrawn off antiseizure drugs as part of presurgical video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/43-45,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45,47-49</a>]. Although abrupt drug withdrawal might underlie this phenomenon, this theory is based on the assumption that the splenium lesion represents vasogenic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Our finding that the lesion demonstrates a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is inconsistent with that hypothesis and suggests instead that the lesion is related to ictal activity per se [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Microvacuolization of the myelin is one pathologic substrate that could account for the increased T2 signal, the decreased ADC, and the reversibility of lesions of the splenium. In one report, splenium lesions were associated with antiseizure drug toxicity in the absence of seizure activity, but the two cases in this report appear to be exceptional in this regard as such lesions are rarely seen in large numbers of patients who undergo MRI while on anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reversible, symmetrical, white-matter edema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres in large part defines the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), of which seizures are a hallmark clinical feature. RPLS usually occurs in association with hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, and the use of cytotoxic and immunosuppressant drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. However, some patients with seizures and radiologic features of RPLS have none of these conditions, suggesting that seizures may be the cause or contribute to the occurrence of this MRI finding. It is usually difficult to exclude moderate elevations in systemic blood pressure with respect to the patient's baseline as a cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Moreover, the high, rather than low, ADC values that are typically seen on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in RPLS make it at odds with other ictal MRI abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-posterior-leukoencephalopathy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiologic basis of local periictal imaging findings appears to be related to increased neuronal activity and its associated metabolic and vascular responses. The pathophysiologic basis of lesions that occur remote from the site of ictal activity is not understood.</p><p>Whereas increased T2 signal suggests edema or gliosis, restricted diffusion is usually associated with metabolic dysfunction or energy deficiency. This phenomenon is best described in acute ischemic stroke. In this setting, restricted diffusion suggests the presence of cytotoxic edema and permanent injury. However, in the periictal setting, the fact that these lesions are often reversible indicates that cell death is not an inevitable sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Another difference is that in ongoing status epilepticus, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and T2 signal changes appear to occur roughly synchronously, whereas in acute ischemia, restricted diffusion often precedes any abnormality of T2 signal. This suggests a difference in the pathophysiology of restricted diffusion in seizures and stroke; in ischemia there is early energy failure; in ongoing status, activity-induced injury with cytotoxic edema may precede overt energy deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is hypothesized that prolonged ictal activity increases glucose utilization that is not adequately matched by enhanced blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,19</a>]. A depletion of cellular energy reserves causes <span class=\"nowrap\">Na+/K+</span> ATP pump failure. This, along with the excitotoxic effects of ictal glutamate release, may trigger NMDA receptor-mediated calcium and water influx into the cell. A reduction in extracellular fluid causes restricted diffusion on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Only limited pathologic correlation for these MRI findings is available. Animal studies have shown swelling of dendrites and astrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In cases in which a biopsy of the affected lesion was undertaken, findings have included gliosis and cellular edema with little to no other evidence of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,10</a>]. Evidence of neuronal death is seen in some cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT ON CLINICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local and remote periictal imaging findings must be interpreted with caution. It is important to recognize that these changes can occur as the consequence of seizure activity per se and therefore may not be helpful in establishing the cause of the seizures.</p><p>In some cases, acute findings may mimic tumor, stroke, or encephalitis and if misinterpreted, would lead to inappropriate diagnostic or therapeutic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3,7,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,56</a>]. Because periictal imaging changes evolve over time, serial imaging studies can establish the nature of these findings as periictal and not related to another process.</p><p>In the setting of potential acute ischemic stroke, when treatment decisions are time-limited, the use of MRI or computed tomography (CT) perfusion studies can be helpful. The combination of hyperperfusion with increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion is uncharacteristic of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/16,38,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,57</a>]. If there is hypoperfusion, a symmetric mean transit time on either the MRI or CT perfusion study suggests a postictal state rather than ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Areas of signal abnormality that do not respect vascular territories are another clue to an ictal rather than vascular origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. An angiographic study may be required to detect or exclude a vascular occlusion potentially amenable to thrombolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The variability in the occurrence of these findings is such that acute MRI changes have little utility in the routine diagnostic evaluation of patients with seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because some acute MRI changes are remote from the site of maximal ictal activity, it is important to evaluate imaging abnormalities in conjunction with clinical and electrographic data; however, when these findings are convergent, it may support a plan for early surgical intervention and help in the process of surgical planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In exceptional patients, MRI may be useful to assess the efficacy of antiseizure treatment. We and others have observed that in focal status epilepticus, anesthesia sufficient to suppress seizure activity also results in reversal of imaging abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-resonance-imaging-changes-related-to-acute-seizure-activity/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>]; this finding might be exploited in settings in which electroencephalogram (EEG) activity is difficult to monitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies performed during or immediately after epileptic seizure can show structural abnormalities that are understood to represent the effect of the seizures rather than the underlying cause.
