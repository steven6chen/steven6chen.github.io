It is performed mainly in patients with short bowel syndrome, with multivisceral transplantation reserved for those patients who develop cholestatic liver disease from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. Primary indications for intestinal transplant include depletion of central venous access sites, multiple episodes of catheter related sepsis, electrolyte disturbance, dehydration, and progressive cholestatic liver failure. Additional indications for intestinal and multivisceral transplant include diffuse portomesenteric thrombosis, malignancies limited to the abdominal compartment, and congenital motility disorders of the intestine.</p><p>The number of patients who undergo ITx is much lower than for other forms of organ transplantation, and there are fewer <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/CertificationandComplianc/downloads/ApprovedTransplantPrograms.pdf&amp;token=MTPvEB9zm029Eoa+DCh9PYQrbxK7kc9WikptNK1MCzArA5I9a+VRWFKpf188TGLDIsz4XBGIKLp72yvUSjSWirhN+ZknXIVFanSDQpw/Gu2gr9eeoHiAhhjdMFoSfhEA&amp;TOPIC_ID=4595\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">centers</a> that perform it.

The number of ITx was highest in 2007 (198 transplants), whereas in the past few years the total number of ITX performed each year has been stabilizing at approximately 100 to 120 transplantation cases per year. In 2014, 139 intestinal transplants were performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review provides an overview of intestinal and multivisceral transplantation. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) <a href=\"http://www.gastro.org/guidelines&amp;token=vopbpe5EOafFTZeXuZ3m7EFROevl8uLSdXNUKt1FAxBdry9G4g4i2pMMCvxwMfBX&amp;TOPIC_ID=4595\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> for short bowel syndrome and ITx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], as well as other AGA guidelines, can be accessed through the AGA website.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal transplantation (ITx) has been performed in children with a variety of causes of short bowel syndrome (SBS) including congenital anomalies, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal atresia, mid-gut volvulus, gastroschisis, and motility disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51384 \">figure 1</a>). In adults, ITx has been performed mainly in those with SBS related to Crohn disease, mesenteric thrombosis, trauma, and desmoid tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72349 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>In both children and adults, ITx is usually considered in those who developed serious complications related to TPN, such as when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one-half of the sites typically used for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) (ie, jugular, subclavian, and iliac veins) become inaccessible due to thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catheter-related sepsis has resulted in disseminated infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repeated bacteremia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients have developed cholestatic liver disease attributable to TPN (such patients may also require liver transplantation). A large database study found that patients with TPN-related liver disease who underwent combined liver and intestinal transplantation had significantly worse outcomes than patients who underwent isolated ITx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This prompted a change in the organ allocation system so that donor organs from throughout the United States (rather than just organs donated within the patient's geographic region) could be offered to patients who require combined liver and intestine grafts in order to minimize their risk of death on the transplant list.</p><p/><p>ITx is also performed in patients who do not have SBS but have other causes of intestinal failure. These include dysmotility disorders (such as generalized Hirschsprung's disease, megacystis microcolon, intestinal pseudo obstruction), genetic intestinal disorders of the mucosal cells (such as microvillus inclusion disease and tufting enteropathy), disease with a high potential for malignant degeneration (such as familial adenomatous polyposis), neoplastic tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas that are limited to the abdominal cavity (eg, neuroendocrine tumors), and radiation-induced bowel injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Consensus criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society of Transplantation and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend intestinal transplantation under the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p>(1) Failure of home parenteral nutrition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impending or overt liver failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis of &ge;2 central veins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more episodes per year of systemic sepsis, particularly those requiring hospitalization with shock and fungemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent episodes of dehydration</p><p/><p>(2) High risk of death</p><p>(3) Severe SBS (gastrotomy, duodenostomy, residual small bowel &lt;10 cm in infants and &lt;20 cm in adults)</p><p>(4) Frequent hospitalization, narcotic dependency, or pseudo-obstruction</p><p>(5) Unwillingness to accept long-term home parenteral nutrition</p><p>The appropriateness of these criteria was confirmed in at least one study that evaluated survival based upon them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contraindications to ITx are similar to liver transplantation. The presence of active infection, aggressive malignancy, multisystem organ failure, cerebral edema, and overt AIDS are absolute contraindications for ITx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETRANSPLANT RECIPIENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with intestinal failure (IF) have an extensive medical history and are either home or hospital bound when they are referred for intestinal transplantation (ITx). Transplant evaluation is performed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a transplant clinician, <span class=\"nowrap\">hepatologist/gastroenterologist,</span> social worker, financial coordinator, pharmacist, infectious disease specialist, cardiologist, nutritionist, and psychologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The past medical and surgical histories and prior endoscopic and radiologic evaluations are reviewed in detail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59216 \">table 1</a>). A liver biopsy is performed in patients with suspected liver disease, although it may be deferred in those with overt clinical features of advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ultrasound of the liver and central veins is obtained to assess the vasculature.</p><p>Serological studies include testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Blood typing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is performed for crossmatching purpose. Evaluation for hypercoagulability is obtained in patients with history of mesenteric vessel thrombosis.</p><p>Part of the outcome of the evaluation is to determine whether the patients should undergo ITx alone, or combined ITx and liver or multivisceral transplantation. Combined ITx and liver transplantation may be required in those with IF and end-stage liver disease, while a multivisceral transplant may be required in those with IF and the presence of neuropathy or extensive mesenteric thrombosis. Intestinal transplantation without liver transplantation may be feasible in some patients with mild to moderate portal fibrosis and liver dysfunction; improvement in liver histology following intestinal transplantation has been described in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">WAIT LIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2006, the overall number of patients on the ITx wait list has been decreasing, most likely due to the advances made in intestinal rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Additionally, the proportion of adult patients listed for ITx has significantly increased and now surpasses the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The median time to transplantation among the patients on the waiting list has decreased over time. For patients listed in 2012 and 2013, median time to transplant was 11.3 months for adult liver and intestine recipients, 7.3 months for pediatric liver and intestine recipients, and 3.6 months for adult intestine alone recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The pretransplant mortality rate keeps decreasing and is currently 6.9 per 100 wait-list years for patients listed in 2012 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR SELECTION/OPERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodynamically stable donors after brain death who have no intestinal pathology represent the majority of donors. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive donors are accepted for CMV-positive recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The donor procurement operation is similar to procurement of the liver. A long midline incision from suprasternal notch to pubic symphysis is made, and the gross anatomy is reviewed with particular attention given to variations in the vascular anatomy of the liver. A biopsy of the liver is performed if there is obvious fatty change.</p><p>The organs are harvested and generally preserved in University of Wisconsin solution (UW solution), although Custodiol solution has also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cold ischemia time is kept to a minimum by coordinating timing of the donor operation with the recipient patient's surgery team.</p><p>The intestinal graft is prepared at the back table. The type of graft is based upon the requirements and condition of the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of anesthesia are similar to those for liver transplantation. However, as noted above, patients with intestinal failure (IF) often have limited vascular access. As a result, assistance from an interventional radiologist may be required to assure adequate venous access. Transesophageal Doppler ultrasound can also be helpful to monitor cardiac status of the recipient if a Swan-Ganz catheter cannot be positioned or if the patient does not have adequate venous access to allow for it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General surgical principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recipient operation is started when the donor organs are harvested and deemed satisfactory. The incisions are planned carefully, keeping in mind the presence of the stomas and creation of new stomas. The recipient inflow and outflow vessels are dissected. If an interposition vascular graft is needed it is anastomosed before the new graft is brought to the front table.</p><p>General surgery principles are followed for restoration of intestinal continuity, with two layer visceral anastomosis. The intestinal anastomosis is constructed in side-to-side fashion to overcome any size discrepancy between the graft and the recipient intestine. A feeding jejunostomy or gastrostomy is created. The distal end of the graft is brought out as a standard end ileostomy or a loop ileostomy. Graft cholecystectomy is performed routinely to reduce the chance of future complications when the liver is included with the graft. Pyloroplasty is performed routinely if the stomach is included in the multivisceral graft. There is an increased trend towards utilization of the donor colon within the allograft since there has been no observed risk of increased postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated intestinal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated intestinal transplantation is performed in patients who have only isolated IF and no associated liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79079 \">figure 3</a>). The arterial inflow is usually from the recipient infrarenal aorta and venous outflow to the portal vein. In patients with compromised mesenteric venous return, such as in mesenteric thrombosis, the venous outflow is created to the inferior vena cava (systemic drainage). The portal vein outflow is preferred due to the concept of hepatotrophic factors providing insulin-like factors for continued optimal hepatocyte function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver-intestinal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver-intestinal transplantation (L-ITx) is considered in recipients who have irreversible IF and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71185 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>In small children, the procedure may be modified to include the duodenum and a rim of pancreas to avoid the need for biliary reconstruction. Inclusion of the pancreas (total) has not increased complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There are some data to suggest that inclusion of the liver helps to confer immunologic tolerance to the small bowel grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, the degree of benefit (and shortage of organs) does not appear to justify routine use of such an approach. As a result, a liver transplant is generally reserved for patients who have ESLD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Multivisceral transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multivisceral transplantation (MVTx) includes the stomach, duodenum, pancreas, small intestine, and liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81359 \">figure 5</a>). A modified version excludes the liver, if the recipient liver is normal. A kidney is occasionally included if the recipient has end stage renal disease. Inclusion of the spleen has been proposed as a possible means to reduce the incidence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusion of donor bone marrow has been proposed as a means to induce immunologic tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/3,19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,26</a>]. The approaches used include a single infusion within 12 hours of revascularization of the allograft or two to five infusions of donor cells in equally divided doses. However, long-term results have not unequivocally shown advantages in terms of decreasing rejection episodes. As a result, many centers do not use this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of domain/abdominal wall transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal wall closure is quite difficult in some recipients of ITx due to multiple surgical operations, recurrent infections, scar tissue formation, and a contracted abdominal cavity. In difficult cases, the closure is obtained with temporary mesh or Gore-Tex grafts. In some cases plastic surgical procedures are required such as rotation flaps to secure the closure of the abdominal wall.</p><p>Case series have also described abdominal wall transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The blood supply is based upon inferior epigastric vessels left in continuity with the donor femoral and iliac vessels. In a series of nine such patients, six patients survived with five intact abdominal walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There were two mild rejection episodes and no episodes of graft versus host disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVING-RELATED TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal transplantation from live donors has been proposed as a means to increase the pool of donor organs and thereby reduce waiting time and wait list morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In addition, living donor transplantation can be performed electively, which may provide an immunologic advantage. Forty-one such procedures have been performed in the last 20 years in the United States, and a similar number have been performed worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>During procurement, the donor intestine is measured from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve. A segment of terminal ileum (200 cm for adult recipients and 150 to 180 cm for pediatric recipients) is harvested 20 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The donor is left with at least 60 percent of the small intestine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Ileal resection'</a>.)</p><p>One of the largest series described 11 recipients who received 12 living-related donor intestinal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Three-year patient and graft survival were 82 and 75 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal transplantation has been made possible by advances in immunosuppression. The earliest attempts (in the 1960s) failed due to lack of adequate immunosuppressive agents. Success improved dramatically after the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in the 1980s and, most notably, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (TAC) in the 1990s.</p><p>Most centers use an induction regimen that includes antilymphocyte (thymoglobulin, ATGAM, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) or anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies (Simulect), with baseline immunosuppression consisting of a combination of TAC, with or without corticosteroids. Initially, TAC is administered intravenously and switched to an oral dose as soon as the intestine resumes normal function. The 12-hour target trough level for TAC is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in the first 90 days of the transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/13,19,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,32</a>]. The new induction protocols have helped to reduce TAC trough levels to 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Optimal strategies to use immunosuppressive agents are intensively studied and are evolving. Thus, several immunosuppressant agents and regimens are being used. Other agents commonly utilized are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil, which has helped reduce dose-related toxicity of calcineurin agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and TAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>mTOR inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, which have the advantage of a low incidence of nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids are used commonly. A bolus is given at the time of transplantation with a taper for five days to a maintenance dose. Corticosteroids are not used as maintenance in patients who receive induction therapy with thymoglobulin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF INTESTINAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal function can be monitored using the d-xylose absorption test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Impaired absorption in the early transplant period may be seen with rejection, cytomegalovirus enteritis, or renal dysfunction. Other tests of intestinal function include fecal fat determination. Intestinal function may be reflected less directly by tolerance to oral feeding, the ability to taper <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, and serial monitoring of serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) is continued postoperatively until intestinal motility returns to normal, as assessed by bowel sounds and stoma output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Once anastomotic integrity is established, enteral feeds are initiated in the form of an elemental diet through a feeding tube. The enteral feeds are advanced gradually as tolerated.</p><p>TPN is usually tapered in four to six weeks once the intestine is able to meet full caloric needs of the recipient. Some patients lack appetite. In particular, children who have been on long-term TPN may need help learning how to eat again. Most patients continue to need supplemental intravenous fluids and electrolytes due to stoma loss during the first post-transplant year.</p><p>In a study that included 177 surviving recipients of intestinal and multivisceral transplantations, 160 (90 percent) achieved nutritional autonomy and were able to take an unrestricted oral diet without the need for intravenous nutrition or fluid supplementation after a mean follow-up of 9.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of technical complications can occur, including bleeding, thrombosis, and anastomotic leaks. Such complications can lead to serious morbidity and mortality. The rate of such complications has varied across reports, but is probably in the range of 10 to 15 percent, although much higher rates have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In an illustrative series, 18 of 39 patients (45 percent) required emergency surgery after intestinal transplantation (ITx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Three (8 percent) developed duodenal stump leak resulting in one death, five (13 percent) developed spontaneous small bowel perforation resulting in two deaths, and three (8 percent) needed emergency laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome, resulting in two deaths. In another series, technical complications, including intestinal anastomotic leak, hepatic artery thrombosis, and biliary anastomotic leak, led to graft loss in 4 of 35 recipients (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In other series, the overall incidence of technical complications is described as approximately 9 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious complications (particularly bacterial infections) are common after ITx and remain the leading cause of death. The most common include intra-abdominal or catheter-related sepsis, or sepsis related to bacterial translocation from the graft.</p><p>Treatment is directed at the underlying cause and may include, in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics, removal of the implicated catheter, treatment against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and gut decontamination. Gut decontamination is used when bacterial translocation is suspected, particularly when the patient has acute rejection. Patients are given a mixture of polymyxin, amphotericin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> orally every six hours.

Treatment principles include a substantial decrease in the immunosuppression regimen and antiviral therapy. Standard chemotherapeutic regimens, such as CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) or rituximab-CHOP are also widely utilized in PTLD patients after ITx.

Transplantation of the small bowel was considered to be particularly vulnerable to GVHD since the small intestine contains a large reservoir of lymphocytes, including the Peyer's patches, lamina propria, and large number of mesenteric lymph nodes. The incidence of GVHD after intestinal transplant is approximately 7 to 9 percent, but its severity varies among published series, with low morbidity and mortality in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and high mortality (up to 72 percent) in another series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The main targets of GVHD are skin, liver, lung, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. The presentation is usually with a skin rash, mouth or tongue lesions, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulcerations, liver dysfunction, and bone marrow suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The incidence of any type of rejection was about 85 percent during the 1990 to 1994 period and 67 percent during the 1995 to 2001 period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26</a>]. Mortality associated with severe rejection is approximately 25 to 45 percent at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Graft loss occurs in virtually all patients with severe rejection despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/25,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute rejection usually present with increased stoma output, fever, abdominal pain, distension, and ileus. Acute rejection also predisposes to sepsis from bacterial translocation and fungal infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is made pathologically from specimens obtained during endoscopy. The histologic features of small intestine rejection include a mixed but mostly mononuclear infiltrate with activated lymphocytes, crypt injury, inflammation, and increased crypt cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The rejection is graded as indeterminate, mild, moderate, or severe depending upon the extent of the mucosal injury and the degree of inflammatory infiltrate and apoptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68676%7EGAST%2F62340%7EGAST%2F74100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68676 graphicRef62340 graphicRef74100 \">picture 1A-C</a>).</p><p>The ability to diagnose rejection in its earliest stages provides the opportunity to intervene before irreversible complications develop. In the early postoperative period, protocol serial endoscopies through the stoma with intestinal biopsies are commonly used for graft surveillance, since the highest number of rejections is observed within the first month post-transplant. In many centers, serial endoscopy and biopsy are performed twice a week for the first month. After the first month, endoscopies are performed less frequently. After the ileostomy is closed, endoscopies are performed only if indicated by clinical signs or symptoms.</p><p>Another approach that has been suggested is zoom magnification endoscopy (up to 100-fold magnification), which may reveal suggestive early mucosal changes that may not be visible with standard endoscopy. These include erythema, villous congestion, and blunted and shortened villi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In one series of adults with clinical features suggestive of acute rejection, the sensitivity and specificity of these findings compared with histology were 45 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Similar test characteristics were described in children included in the study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment for mild rejection typically involves bolus doses of corticosteroids and intensification of the baseline immunosuppressive regimen. Anti T-cell antibodies may be used in steroid-resistant rejection. Unfortunately, more intensive immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (which increases the risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been efforts to reduce rates of rejection by irradiating donor grafts (ex vivo), infusing donor bone marrow, or by leukocyte depletion prior to transplant. In one report, for example, 15 ITx grafts were irradiated ex vivo and recipients also received a single bone marrow infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Outcomes were compared with five recipients who served as controls. The incidence of rejection was much lower in the irradiated group (7 versus 80 percent). However, this approach is not used routinely because of the risk of radiation-induced small bowel injury. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow infusion'</a> above.)</p><p>Most current anti-rejection protocols include induction immunosuppression with antilymphocyte agents such as thymoglobulin, given in the peri-operative period, in conjunction with a short course of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors as maintenance therapy. &#160;</p><p>Other approaches have been attempted, mainly by modifying the immunosuppressive regimen. In addition, as noted above, the inclusion of a liver may help to protect from rejection of the intestinal graft. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Liver-intestinal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC REJECTION AND GRAFT FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rejection is observed in approximately 8 percent of patients undergoing intestinal transplantation (ITx). Factors associated with chronic rejection include isolated ITx compared with small bowel-liver grafts, acute rejection within the first month, increased number and higher grade of acute rejection episodes, older recipient age, non-Caucasian race, and Caucasian to non-Caucasian transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/26,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,47</a>].</p><p>Patients usually present with poor oral intake and lack of appetite, thereby requiring enteral feeding for many months after transplant. Alternatively, some patients with prolonged or repeated episodes of chronic rejection may present with intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis can be suggested by intestinal biopsy obtained by endoscopy, or by intestinal function tests (such as d-Xylose absorption). The latter can suggest the diagnosis even before it becomes clinically evident and may be performed as part of a surveillance program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A definitive diagnosis is made with full-thickness biopsy of the allograft, usually after allograft removal. Characteristic findings include obliteration of submucosal vessels and fibrosis of the allograft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;, section on 'D-xylose test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">COSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of intestinal transplantation (ITx) with or without transplantation of other organs is in the range of $150,000 to $250,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This compares with an estimated annual cost of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) of $100,000 to $200,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. ITx is considered to be cost-effective provided that graft function is maintained for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Cost-effectiveness must consider the feasibility of alternatives, the consequences of a failed transplant, and quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data assessing quality of life in recipients of intestinal transplants. In a study of 29 children, quality of life scores were similar to age-matched controls one year after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, the assessment of quality of life differed when reported by parents. Parents more frequently reported decreased general health and physical functioning in intestinal transplant recipients. In other studies, quality of life after ITx appeared to be better than or equal to quality of life on TPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>In a study that included 76 adult recipients of intestinal and multivisceral transplantations, there was improvement in many psychosocial and emotional quality of life domains following transplantation, including anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">cognitive/emotional</span> ability, coping skills, sleep pattern, <span class=\"nowrap\">impulsiveness/control,</span> social support, and <span class=\"nowrap\">leisure/recreation</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. On the other hand, depression and financial obligations were worse after transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Karnofsky scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance status is a measure of a patient's functional capacity. A number of metrics have been developed to quantify performance status; among them, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) is the most commonly used. The KPS ranges from values of 100, signifying normal functional status with no complaints or evidence of disease, to 0, signifying death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In a summary of 551 recipients, Karnofsky scores of 90 to 100 were observed in 80 percent, 61 to 89 in 10 percent, 31 to 60 in 5 percent, and 1 to 30 in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Long-term physical and psychiatric rehabilitation was achieved in 85 percent of ITx recipients who survived beyond six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft and patient survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcomes in patients undergoing ITx has improved significantly compared with early efforts, with improvements in the immunosuppression protocols and early detection and treatment of rejection. Graft survival for adult and pediatric patients is similar. As reported by the 2013 Annual Report by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], one-year graft survival for all recipients of an intestinal graft (year 2011 to 2012) is approximately 75 percent, while five-year graft survival for patients transplanted between 2007 and 2008 is 52 percent. Patient survival is approximately 80 percent at one year and just over 60 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similarly, in a comprehensive report from the largest series of intestinal transplants, one- and five-year patient survival rates were 92 and 70 percent, respectively, in patients who underwent transplantation between 2001 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, overall patient survival at 10 and 15 years was only 42 and 35 percent, respectively. Thus, short- and medium-term graft and patient survival are good, but the long-term results are still disappointing.</p><p>Various predictors of graft and patient survival have been proposed. In the intestinal transplant registry, graft and patient survival were related to the type of immunosuppression, whereas graft survival was lower with retransplantation and varied across centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, the most important predictor appeared to be the recipients' status: Homebound recipients had a 68 percent survival, whereas hospitalized patients had a 42 percent survival at two years. These measures undoubtedly reflected the severity of underlying disease and comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The future of intestinal transplantation (ITx) is promising despite its obvious challenges. The surgical technique has been standardized, and the immunosuppression regimens are improving. Efforts are focusing on improving immunosuppression protocols including methods to promote tolerance.</p><p>There will also be improvements in recognition and prevention of complications. The early recognition and treatment of acute rejection to prevent graft loss and associated complications of opportunistic infections and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease remain a priority. Development of a clinical noninvasive marker for detection of acute rejection in ITx would be helpful.</p><p>The shortage of appropriate deceased donors contributes to significant wait list mortality, which needs to be overcome, possibly with the increased use of live donors.
