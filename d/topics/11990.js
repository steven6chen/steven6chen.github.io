The role of drug therapy has been questioned, however, because of concerns about efficacy, safety, and the observation that body weight loss slows and then plateaus with continued treatment, and most patients regain weight when their weight loss drugs are stopped.</p><p>The decision to initiate drug therapy in overweight individuals should be made only after a careful evaluation of risks and benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. This topic will review drug therapy for weight loss in patients with obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86204 \">table 1</a>).

Patients with obesity given drugs should be advised that when the maximal therapeutic effect is achieved, weight loss ceases. When drug therapy is discontinued, weight is expected to rise. Achieving and maintaining weight loss is made difficult by weight loss-induced changes in energy expenditure and hormonal mediators of appetite, favoring weight regain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Improve health status</strong> &ndash; If improvement in one's health is the goal, success may be measured by the degree of weight loss and measurable or perceived improvement in physical function, comorbidities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sense of well-being. Weight loss should exceed 2 kg during the first month of drug therapy (1 pound per week), fall more than 4 to 5 percent below baseline between three to six months, and remain at this level to be considered effective. A weight loss of 5 to 10 percent can substantially reduce the development of diabetes in those with prediabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and reduce blood pressure and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improvement in health status after weight loss is an important criterion in the determination of whether to continue drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

All patients who would benefit from weight loss should receive counseling on diet, exercise, and goals for weight loss. Refinement and continuance of health-seeking behaviors is encouraged for life. Earnest counseling around healthy eating, physical activity, and health-seeking behavior is essential for every patient seeking weight loss, whether used alone or in combination with weight loss medication or bariatric surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Approach to underlying comorbidities</strong> &ndash; An important component of the initial evaluation of obese and overweight patients is the assessment of obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, heart disease, sleep apnea, and symptomatic osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H13187459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the obese patient'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with specific comorbidities, we prefer a weight-centric approach to chronic disease management, trying, if possible, to select the drugs to treat the comorbidity that may produce weight loss, rather than weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. Several drugs are well known to produce weight gain and should be avoided if good alternatives are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Medications used to treat diabetes, depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85807\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85807 \">table 2</a>), and autoimmune diseases are particularly notorious for causing weight gain.

The decision to initiate drug therapy should be individualized and made only after a careful evaluation of the risks and benefits of all treatment options (lifestyle, pharmacologic, surgical). Recommendations for use of drug therapy vary greatly among clinicians. Some UpToDate experts do not use drug therapy often, whereas others prescribe them in selected patients after providing extensive counseling about lifestyle measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14282666\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic options for the treatment of obesity include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a> (daily injection), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorcaserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorcaserin</a>, combination phentermine-extended release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> (in one capsule), combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-and-naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion-naltrexone</a> (in one extended-release tablet), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzphetamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phendimetrazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phendimetrazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylpropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylpropion</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86204 \">table 1</a>). In meta-analyses of randomized trials comparing pharmacologic therapy with placebo, all active drug interventions are effective at reducing weight compared with placebo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115096 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/6,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,19</a>]. Many of the trials in the meta-analyses have serious limitations, however, including short duration of study, high attrition rates, heterogeneity, and inadequate reporting of important clinical outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, there are few head-to-head trials comparing the individual therapies, and it is uncertain whether people who fail to respond to one therapy will in fact respond to another.</p><p>For patients who are candidates for pharmacologic therapy, the choice of antiobesity drugs is often governed by the comorbidities and relative contraindications present in the individual patient. As an example, although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> does not produce enough weight loss (5 percent) to qualify as a &quot;weight loss drug&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], it is a good choice for overweight individuals at high risk for diabetes. This topics is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H3027901413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Choice of drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p>When a decision has been made to initiate pharmacologic therapy, agents with the fewest side effects are preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86204 \">table 1</a>) and single agents are preferred over combination therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Orlistat</a> may be the preferred first choice among weight loss medications owing to its demonstrated benefits with regard to glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure; long-duration trials; and safety profile. Unfortunately, it has a high prevalence of unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects and is often not tolerated by patients.<strong> </strong>Patients need to be counseled carefully about side effects before beginning this drug. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Orlistat'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Liraglutide</a> is an alternative option for initial treatment, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, owing to its demonstrated benefits with regard to cardiometabolic risk factors, glycemia, and quality of life. However, unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting), the need for a daily injection, and cost may limit the use of this drug.

It appears to have fewer adverse effects than orlistat, although long-term safety data are limited. Like orlistat and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a>, it may be used in obese patients with diabetes, hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyslipidemia. (See <a href=\"#H1269514\" class=\"local\">'Lorcaserin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-and-topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine-topiramate</a> (extended release) is an option for men or postmenopausal women with obesity <strong>without</strong> hypertension or coronary heart disease, particularly those who do not tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorcaserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorcaserin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a>. The efficacy for weight loss of phentermine-extended release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> appears to be greater than for either orlistat or lorcaserin, but it may have more side effects (eg, increased heart rate, dose-related increase in the incidence of psychiatric [eg, depression, anxiety] and cognitive [eg, disturbance in attention] adverse events). It may be an acceptable option for a patient with an obesity-related comorbidity, such as sleep apnea, who does not have any cardiovascular disease. The presence of topiramate in this combination may increase risk of fetal malformations, and it should thus be used with caution in women of childbearing age, who should have a pregnancy test before its use and monthly thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H3443778785\" class=\"local\">'Phentermine-topiramate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-and-naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion-naltrexone</a> (sustained release) produces similar weight loss as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorcaserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorcaserin</a>, but it has more side effects and contraindications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86204 \">table 1</a>). Owing to the uncertainty about cardiovascular effects, we prefer to use orlistat, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a>, or lorcaserin, rather than bupropion-naltrexone. (See <a href=\"#H3353512734\" class=\"local\">'Bupropion-naltrexone'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phentermine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzphetamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phendimetrazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phendimetrazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylpropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylpropion</a> are only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for short-term use, have more side effects, and there is potential for abuse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86204 \">table 1</a>). However, some clinicians and their patients choose to use phentermine for longer periods of time, owing to long-term clinical experience with this drug. (See <a href=\"#H1268482\" class=\"local\">'Sympathomimetic drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14282672\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight, vital signs</strong> &ndash; After initiating pharmacologic therapy, we monitor weight loss, blood pressure, and heart rate on a weekly basis for four weeks and then monthly for the next three to four months, at which time a decision should be made whether to continue the drug. If patients do not lose 4 to 5 percent of body weight after 12 weeks of tolerated maximum-dose therapy, the drug should be tapered and discontinued. Although it is uncertain whether people who fail to respond to one drug will respond to another (or to a combination drug), this approach can be tried if the patient and clinician believe the benefits outweigh the risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood sugar in patients with diabetes</strong> &ndash; Weight loss may cause hypoglycemia in patients taking medication for diabetes, especially insulin or insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas, meglitinides), and in such patients, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be performed more frequently for safety. SMBG should be performed at least daily in people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues during initiation and dose titration of weight loss medications. In patients with well-controlled diabetes, it may also be advisable to reduce the doses of sulfonylureas or meglitinides during the first four weeks of treatment with an antiobesity drug and adjust as needed based on blood glucose values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> &ndash; We ask about adverse effects during every visit. More specific monitoring instructions depend upon the drug initiated.

Patient taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a> should be monitored for symptoms of acute pancreatitis and gallbladder disease. Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and increases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients treated with phentermine-topiramate because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Thus, serum electrolytes (including bicarbonate) and creatinine should be measured before and approximately four weeks after initiation of this combination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS THAT ALTER FAT DIGESTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Orlistat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Orlistat</a> alters fat digestion by inhibiting pancreatic lipases. Thus, fat is not completely hydrolyzed, and fecal fat excretion is increased. In normal individuals eating a diet that contains 30 percent fat, orlistat causes a dose-dependent increase in fecal fat excretion, inhibiting the absorption of approximately 25 to 30 percent of calories ingested as fat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> in facilitating weight loss has been demonstrated in several randomized trials and in meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/9,21-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21-32</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 12 trials that included patients with and without diabetes and reported data with 12-month outcomes, patients randomly assigned to orlistat plus a behavioral intervention lost 5 to 10 kg (8 percent of baseline weight) compared with 3 to 6 kg in the control group (placebo plus behavioral intervention), for a mean placebo-subtracted difference of 3 kg (95% CI -3.9 to -2.0 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Weight loss was maintained with up to 24 to 36 months of orlistat treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another meta-analysis, orlistat was equally effective in Caucasians and ethnic minority groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In one of the longest trials, 3304 overweight patients, 21 percent of whom had impaired glucose tolerance, were randomly assigned to placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Over the remaining three years of the trial, there was a small regain in weight, such that by the end of four years, the orlistat-treated patients were 6.9 percent below baseline compared with 4.1 percent for those receiving placebo. After four years, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was lower in the orlistat group (6.2 versus 9 percent). In other trials in patients with diabetes, orlistat resulted in significantly more weight loss and reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) at one year than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent trial published after the meta-analyses (146 obese patients [mean body mass index (BMI) 39.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>]),</span> the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a> and a low-fat diet (&lt;30 percent of daily energy) resulted in similar weight loss (approximately 9 percent) as a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (initially &lt;20 g <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Ephedra and ephedra alkaloids (Ma huang) are a group of ephedrine-like molecules found in plants. Ephedrine stimulates weight loss, at least in part, by increasing thermogenesis and by reducing food intake. Because of safety concerns, ephedrine with or without caffeine and the ephedra alkaloids are not approved for treatment of obesity and have been removed from the market [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; Conclusions from a 2015 review of available dietary supplements were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Green tea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>], <em>Garcinia cambogia</em> (hydroxycitric acid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], conjugated linoleic acid, and chitosan were ineffective for weight loss, and their use should be discouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Efficacy and safety data were unclear for chromium, <em>Gambisan</em>, <em>Hoodia gordonii</em>, and <em>Cynanchum auriculatum</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a 2013 meta-analysis of nine trials comparing chromium picolinate with placebo in overweight adults or adults with obesity, the mean difference in weight after 12 to 16 weeks was -1.1 kg, favoring chromium picolinate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. There was no evidence of a dose effect. The meta-analysis was limited by the poor quality of the included trials and the absence of safety data. Given the limited evidence, we do not suggest chromium as a dietary supplement for the treatment of obesity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Guar gum preparations derived from the Indian cluster bean have been promoted as weight reduction agents. The presumed mechanism of action is an increase in the viscosity of gastric contents, leading to a feeling of postprandial fullness. However, in a meta-analysis of 20 clinical trials, guar gum was not effective for weight loss and caused adverse events such as abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2350894365\"><span class=\"h2\">Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been advertised to aid in weight loss, clinical trials fail to support this claim. Oral or sublingual diet drops of hCG are also available and are touted to have the same benefits as injectable hCG. Among the values claimed for this treatment are loss of 1 to 2 pounds daily, absence of hunger, and maintenance of muscle tone. Several randomized trials have shown that the hCG diet is <strong>not</strong> more effective than placebo in the treatment of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. An integral component of the hCG diet is adherence to a very-low-calorie diet (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day),</span> which has been recognized to result in short-term weight loss simply from caloric restriction, with no added benefit from hCG. Thus, hCG should <strong>not</strong> be used for the treatment of obesity. In addition, very-low-calorie diets have not been shown to be superior to conventional diets for long-term weight loss.

The decision to initiate drug therapy should be individualized and made only after a careful evaluation of risks and benefits. Recommendations for use of drug therapy vary greatly among clinicians. Some UpToDate experts do not use drug therapy often, whereas others prescribe them in selected patients after providing extensive counseling about lifestyle measures.
