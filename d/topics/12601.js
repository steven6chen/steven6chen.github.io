Fetal arrhythmias complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies and have the potential to compromise fetal health. They are categorized according to their rhythm (irregular, regular) and rate (tachycardia, bradycardia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The type and distribution of arrhythmias in one large series are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60210 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Fetal arrhythmias will be reviewed here. Diagnosis and management of arrhythmias in neonates and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Irregular heart rate (arrhythmias) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H353807113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The conduction system of the fetal heart is functionally mature by 16 weeks of gestation, and produces a regular rhythm and rate between 110 and 160 beats per minute (bpm) for the remainder of the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fetal arrhythmias are defined by deviations from these parameters. They are typically detected when auscultating the fetal heart, while monitoring the fetal heart rate (FHR) with external or internal devices, or during an antenatal ultrasound examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;, section on 'Physiologic basis of fetal heart rate changes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At present, ultrasonography is the best modality for evaluation of fetal arrhythmias. It is important to differentiate fetal arrhythmias, particularly intrapartum, from nonreassuring FHR changes related to hypoxemia or other factors. This distinction is usually obvious because of the clinical circumstances. For example, repetitive bradycardia that begins and ends with (or following) uterine contractions is probably related to hypoxemia, while tachycardia associated with prolonged fetal activity or maternal fever probably reflects a normal physiological response rather than a conduction abnormality. When there are concerns, fetal well-being can be evaluated by assessing the FHR response to fetal stimulation or movement, biophysical profile score, or through umbilical blood gas analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fetal heart rate assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-fetal-biophysical-profile\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The fetal biophysical profile&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-dimensional ultrasound is used to diagnose the specific arrhythmia, evaluate cardiac anatomy, evaluate cardiac function, and look for signs of hydrops fetalis. The cardiac anatomy should be carefully reviewed, as arrhythmias can be associated with congenital heart disease. This risk is about 10 percent in patients with tachycardia and about 50 percent in patients with bradycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of fluid collections consistent with hydrops is an ominous sign that the arrhythmia has impaired the normal cardiovascular physiology by affecting ventricular filling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular output.

It allows determination of the relative timing of cardiac events, thus helping to characterize the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulsed wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulsed wave Doppler velocimetry can be used to evaluate the relationship of the atrial contractions to the ventricular contractions. This is done by placing the Doppler cursor in the left ventricular outflow tract so that the cursor is parallel to the direction of aortic flow. Once the cursor is lined up, the Doppler gate is widened so that it can sample both left ventricular inflow and outflow at the same time. With this tracing, one can measure the P-R interval and evaluate the timing of the atrial and ventricular contractions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-essentials-physics-and-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography essentials: Physics and instrumentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulsed Doppler can also be used to assess blood flow in the umbilical vein and artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The waveform in the umbilical vessels may be abnormal secondary to changes in intracardiac pressures or the presence of AV valve regurgitation caused by atrial-ventricular dyssynchrony <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Doppler ultrasound of the umbilical artery for fetal surveillance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue Doppler imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) can be utilized to help characterize wall motion. This makes it easier to identify the origin of the arrhythmia and can be quite helpful when other modalities are not diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8167751\"><span class=\"h2\">External fetal heart rate monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard FHR monitoring has the advantages of being readily available and able to provide continuous monitoring over long periods of time. However, aliasing at 240 bpm limits its ability to track the most rapid tachycardias and very transient arrhythmias (ie, the internal logic of the monitor may display a rate that is half that of the true rate). Despite these limitations, standard FHR monitoring is useful for sustained monitoring of fetuses with slower forms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (eg, atrial flutter) and to determine the proportion of time the fetus is in normal and abnormal rhythms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8167758\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal magnetocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetocardiography shifts the electrical signals into an evoked magnetic signal that can be processed to create a beat-to-beat magnetocardiogram that looks much like a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG). Continuous recordings can be performed for relatively sustained periods and have permitted elegant demonstration of arrhythmia <span class=\"nowrap\">onset/offset</span> and more direct observation of mechanisms. The equipment is not widely available, requires careful shielding and requires skilled technical support, so the technology remains investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104719830\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although arrhythmias in children and adults can be evaluated by obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG), fetal electrocardiography is complicated by difficulty obtaining a signal due to low voltage, background noise, and the inclusion of the maternal electrocardiographic signal during the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The technique requires time and skill to ensure good-quality signals and involves the use of up to 12 maternal abdominal leads and a single ground lead across the maternal body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Vernix caseosa can attenuate or eliminate the fetal electrocardiography signal because of its electric insulating properties.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">IRREGULAR RHYTHMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irregular rhythms are the most common arrhythmias noted during routine obstetrical evaluation. They are most common in the late second or third trimester, but can present earlier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Premature atrial contractions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of an irregular rhythm in the fetus is premature atrial contractions (also known as isolated atrial extrasystoles). In some cases, there is 1:1 conduction of ectopic beats so the ventricular contraction will also be early. On auscultation, the rhythm will sound irregular, but the rate will be nearly normal.</p><p>In other cases, the premature beat will be blocked so there will be no associated ventricular contraction. In these cases, the ventricular rate will be slower than the atrial rate. When the premature beats are blocked intermittently, the rhythm sounds irregular and the heart rate rapidly varies from normal to slow.</p><p>Premature atrial contractions are usually benign and intermittent, and may resolve prior to delivery or shortly after birth. However, 1 to 3 percent of fetuses with premature atrial contractions will develop a tachyarrhythmia, which can lead to cardiovascular decompensation. Any fetus with a tachyarrhythmia should be evaluated promptly by a fetal cardiology team.</p><p>Congenital heart disease is identified in only 0.3 to 2 percent of fetuses with premature atrial beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2235116146\"><span class=\"h4\">Infrequent isolated ectopy (&lt;3 to 5 beats per minute)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In fetuses with frequent isolated ectopy (not bigeminy, trigeminy or &gt;3 to 5 beats per minute), the FHR should be evaluated by auscultation or Doppler device at each prenatal visit to exclude conversion to a tachyarrhythmia. If frequent ectopy is noted, the fetal heart rate should be checked more frequently (weekly) by the obstetric provider to exclude intermittent sustained tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ectopy will often resolve within a few weeks, at which point routine obstetrical visit schedules can be resumed.</p><p>An obstetric ultrasound examination also should be performed. Since most fetuses do not have significant structural heart disease, a level II ultrasound by a sonologist with experience in assessment of cardiac function and structure is often sufficient. The examination should include color Doppler evaluation of intracardiac and great artery flow. If this evaluation is abnormal, we suggest referral to a fetal cardiology team for a full evaluation of cardiac function and anatomy.

They are also more difficult to diagnose by echocardiography alone. Premature junctional contractions may be characterized by simultaneous premature atrial and ventricular wall motion. Premature ventricular contractions are characterized by ventricular wall motion, which is not preceded by atrial contraction.</p><p>Isolated junctional and ventricular premature contractions have a benign prognosis for the fetus. As with premature atrial contractions, cardiovascular compromise can occur if sustained junctional or ventricular tachycardia develops. These cases should be evaluated promptly by a fetal cardiology team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TACHYARRHYTHMIAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of fetal tachycardia should prompt immediate evaluation and consultation with a fetal cardiology team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The presence of sustained tachyarrhythmia or an intermittent arrhythmia that is frequent and prolonged (occurring &gt;50 percent of the time) puts the fetus at risk for cardiovascular failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Early echocardiographic signs of hemodynamic compromise include biatrial enlargement and atrioventricular valve regurgitation; later findings include cardiomegaly and decreased systolic function, ultimately resulting in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Signs of evolving hydrops include fluid accumulation in pericardial or pleural spaces, ascites, subcutaneous edema, increases in amniotic fluid volume, thickening of the placenta. These signs can appear within 24 hours of onset of sustained tachycardia; therefore, if tachycardia is persistent, re-evaluation for hydrops should occur at frequent intervals, even daily.</p><p>The goal in managing fetuses with tachyarrhythmias is prevention or resolution of hydrops since the mortality rate of fetuses with arrhythmias and hydrops is over 50 percent, which is far higher than in cases without evidence of significant heart failure. This is achieved with medical therapy, either in utero or postnatally, to convert the tachycardia to sinus rhythm or by slowing the ventricular rate. Individual series report that cardioversion is successful in 65 to 95 percent of cases, within 48 hours to one week of initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A summary of these series found that termination of atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">flutter/supraventricular</span> tachycardia (SVT) before birth occurred in 51 percent of fetuses (115 of 226) treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> as first line-therapy, in 64 percent (45 of 70) of those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> initially, and in 66 percent (23 of 35) of those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Five to 10 percent of fetuses with pathologic tachycardia have congenital heart disease.

Fetal heart rate variability is usually present. Prolonged sinus tachycardia may result from early fetal hypoxia, elevated maternal catecholamine levels due to anxiety or pain, maternal fever or thyrotoxicosis, intraamniotic infection, or maternal administration of medications, typically beta-adrenergic or vagolytic drugs, but sometimes also antihistamines with anticholinergic activity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Thyroid function studies may be warranted as a routine component of maternal assessment, and are always appropriate if the mother has symptoms of thyroid disease.</p><p>An initial period of fetal observation to document baseline status is warranted before beginning drug therapy. A reasonable approach is to admit the patient to the labor or antepartum unit and either obtain frequent Doppler FHR assessments (eg, hourly when the mother is <span class=\"nowrap\">awake/every</span> two hours when she is asleep) or perform continuous external fetal monitoring when technically possible, as in the slower tachycardias. Fetal assessment can be done while performing the maternal medical and obstetrical assessment, and possibly coincident with an initial drug loading.</p><p>For the nonhydropic fetus (particularly with clearly intermittent SVT or slow SVT) with a healthy mother, slowly initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> orally as an outpatient is reasonable; however, most other antiarrhythmic drugs are initiated with inpatient maternal monitoring, including daily ECGs.

Many medications have the potential to break SVT; they differ in their side effects and their ability to cross the placenta. In general, they all have a lower success rate in fetuses with hydrops, likely due to lower transplacental transfer. There are no standards for drug dosing, the need for loading doses, and whether the mother should be hospitalized when therapy is initiated. Drug dosing is empiric and depends on maternal, as well as fetal, factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2595640\"><span class=\"h4\">Digoxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on its safety profile and efficacy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> has long been the initial drug of choice, either administered orally or intravenously to the mother or, if unsuccessful, via direct intramuscular fetal injection. As discussed above, a literature review found that termination of atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">flutter/SVT</span> before birth occurred in 51 percent of fetuses (115 of 226) treated with digoxin as first line-therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis (10 studies, n = 291 patients) concluded that more potent agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, may be more appropriate first-line agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Compared with digoxin, flecainide was more likely to result in SVT termination, especially in hydropic fetuses, with no increase in maternal side effects or fetal demise. &#160;</p><p>Presuming normal maternal renal function, a reasonable oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> loading dose for rapid loading is 1 to 2 mg, which can be given in three doses: 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg, and 0.25 mg over 18 to 24 hours, followed by a digoxin level. Additional doses are given if the digoxin level is low. The target level is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. After this target is achieved, it may take an additional 24 hours before fetal serum levels reach a steady state, so a period of observation to assess the fetal response to maximum maternal therapy is reasonable. Once the target (therapeutic) maternal serum level is achieved, the risk of maternal toxicity from additional dose increases likely outweighs any fetal benefits of supratherapeutic maternal digoxin levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-with-digoxin-initial-dosing-monitoring-and-dose-modification#H2474850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment with digoxin: Initial dosing, monitoring, and dose modification&quot;, section on 'Rapid digoxin loading'</a>.)</p><p>The maternal maintenance dose is then determined by titrating to the fetal response, which might take several days. Close inpatient maternal monitoring is mandatory to avoid maternal toxicity (gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances, arrhythmias including premature beats and atrioventricular [AV] block). Daily ECGs to monitor for P-R prolongation and T wave changes are required when rapid loading is performed; continuous cardiac monitoring is not usually done. With slower or nonsustained arrhythmias, a slower outpatient course of drug initiation and maintenance is appropriate.</p><p>Maintenance dosing usually needs to be higher in pregnant women than nonpregnant women because of increases in blood volume and glomerular filtration rates associated with pregnancy, often ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 mg daily given in divided doses. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> levels can be obtained rapidly in most facilities, which permits relatively timely dose adjustments.</p><p>When the fetus is hydropic, it is less likely to respond at standard therapeutic levels so higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> may be given, but there is substantial practice variability on this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/3,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30,31</a>]. If supratherapeutic levels of digoxin are induced, the maternal ECG and digoxin levels must be closely monitored to avoid maternal toxicity. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies of transplacental treatment of fetal tachycardia, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> were more effective than digoxin for conversion of any fetal tachycardia to sinus rhythm, and the difference in efficacy was greatest in hydropic fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; another meta-analysis also concluded that flecainide was more effective for termination of SVT than digoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Direct fetal intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is another approach which has been used to achieve therapeutic fetal drug levels, particularly in the hydropic fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Because of maternal risks associated with the use of these medications, we do not use them routinely as first-line agents and carefully consider the specific maternal risks and benefits when deciding which second-line therapy to try. For the fetus with sustained, rapid arrhythmia during the initial period of monitoring, a rapid shift to the potent agents is warranted. There are multiple case series in experienced centers and collaborative groups where flecainide and, at times, sotalol are the initial agents for those with sustained tachycardia &gt;210 bpm.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> has also been used; however, there are concerns about cardiovascular collapse in fetuses and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Because none of these drugs have been evaluated in randomized trials, there are no strong data favoring one drug or combination over another. Case reports suggest that all of these alternative therapies may be effective both singly and in combination with digoxin. Flecainide consistently decreases the heart rate in most SVT. Time to conversion is typically shorter with both flecainide and sotalol compared with standard- to mid-dose digoxin. All of the treatments appear to be safe, although careful monitoring for maternal toxicity is important. Sotalol and flecainide can be proarrhythmic in certain settings, so it is important to have an accurate diagnosis of the arrhythmia, and to monitor both the fetus and the mother carefully.</p><p>Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, the balance of the evidence suggests a slightly higher conversion rate of SVT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> and possibly a slightly higher conversion rate of atrial flutter with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Relatively few patients have been treated and reported so these conclusions are tentative. Flecainide has the advantage of not having beta-blockade effects. Serum levels can be obtained, although it may take several days before the results are available.

The electrical impulse originates in the sinus node and is normally conducted. Short episodes of sinus bradycardia, especially in the second trimester fetus, are common and physiologic. They may be due to transient fetal head or umbilical cord compression.</p><p>New-onset sinus bradycardia can be secondary to maternal hypotension, maternal seizures, paracervical block anesthesia, or impaired fetal oxygenation, which can result from conditions including, but not limited to, abruptio placenta, uterine rupture, prolapsed umbilical cord, fetal hemorrhage, and fetal hypotension. Under these circumstances, a poor outcome may result if the cause of the fetal distress cannot be corrected. However, sustained sinus bradycardia may also be associated with structural cardiac anomalies or long Q-T syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/16,17,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,73</a>]. In the healthy pregnancy with fetal sinus bradycardia and cardiac disease, the most common explanation is heterotaxy or long Q-T. In heterotaxy, the bradycardia is thought to be due to a primary abnormality of the sinus node. The actual structural heart disease may be quite mild (eg, interrupted IVC), or can be very complex (single ventricle heart disease).</p><p>It is possible for fetuses to tolerate heart rates in the 70 to 90 bpm range over a long period of time, including fetuses with structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As in complete heart block, weekly obstetrical follow-up with assessment of fetal well-being is recommended. Alternative methods of evaluation of fetal well-being, such as heart rate variability, umbilical artery Doppler flow, or biophysical profile assessments, may be of assistance in these cases.

Optimally, if sustained tachycardia is present, either cardiology or pediatrics specialists should be available at the time of delivery to help with diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. </p><p>For mildly bradycardic fetuses, delivery is typically uneventful and the heart rate is adequate to support cardiac output. In a small percentage of cases, the heart rate can drop dramatically after birth, resulting in poor cardiac output. Even in those infants whose heart rate does not change much, cardiac output can be insufficient to support systemic perfusion once the low resistance placenta is gone.

However, atrial fibrillation is quite rare in fetuses and the diagnosis should be made carefully. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Management of atrial flutter and fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia may be due to consistently blocked premature contractions, complete heart block or sinus bradycardia. Heart block and sinus bradycardia are more likely to be associated with structural heart disease than tachyarrhythmias. A short burst of sinus bradycardia is a normal physiologic finding, but sustained bradycardia requires further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Bradyarrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a fetus is diagnosed with complete heart block, maternal blood should be sampled for <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies. In addition, a complete anatomic survey should be done to exclude structural heart disease, particularly forms of heterotaxy. Treatment of the fetus with complete atrioventricular (AV) block is primarily expectant. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complete heart block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> positive women whose fetuses have incomplete heart block (mechanical AV interval &gt;~150 msec or second degree AV block), we suggest a short course of maternal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While dexamethasone does not reverse complete AV block, it may ameliorate hydrops, which has a high mortality rate. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complete heart block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged sinus bradycardia is nonreassuring. Causes include maternal hypotension, maternal seizures, paracervical block anesthesia, and impaired fetal oxygenation (eg, abruptio placenta, uterine rupture, prolapsed umbilical cord). It may also be due to fetal cardiac disease such as heterotaxy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long Q-T syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Sinus bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetus with a sustained arrhythmia can undergo labor and be delivered vaginally as long as fetal well-being can be monitored in some way. We suggest that appropriate support personnel from pediatrics, neonatology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiology be available at the time of the delivery. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If antepartum treatment is initiated, potential maternal toxicity must be monitored, and collaborative care including obstetrics, pediatric cardiology and often an adult cardiologist is needed.
