Although the etiology is benign in most cases, this symptom may lead to school absences, restriction of activities and causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families. A thorough history and physical examination usually can determine the cause and identify patients who require acute intervention and those who can be managed with reassurance and continued follow-up. Laboratory testing is necessary only in a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the absence of associated symptoms of illness, positive findings on physical examination related to the cardiac or respiratory systems, or symptoms during exertion, a serious organic cause is unlikely.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents.

life-threatening cause, an accurate description of the chest pain can help establish a specific diagnosis as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96739 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management/abstract/3,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-8</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Temporal elements</strong> &ndash; The duration and time course of the onset of chest pain may be a useful distinguishing feature. Chronic pain is unlikely to have a serious underlying cause and often is musculoskeletal, psychogenic, or idiopathic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute pain is more likely to be caused by a medical condition. As examples, pain caused by pulmonary conditions (eg, asthma or pneumothorax) or vascular events (eg, aortic dissection or acute pulmonary embolism) typically has an abrupt onset. However, ischemic myocardial pain, which is unusual in children and is described in greater detail above, may have a gradual onset with increasing intensity over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quality</strong> &ndash; A description of the quality of the pain may be helpful. The pain associated with costochondritis typically is described as midsternal in location and sharp in quality with minimal radiation. It occurs mainly at rest and lasts for seconds to a few minutes. The pain may increase in intensity with deep inspiration because of stretching of the costochondral junctions or muscle fibers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with slipping rib syndrome may describe &quot;something slipping or giving away,&quot; &quot;a popping sensation,&quot; or &quot;hearing a clicking sound&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In that condition, pain frequently occurs with bending over or deep breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Location</strong> &ndash; Pain that localizes to a small area on the chest more likely is of chest wall or pleural origin rather than visceral. Ischemic pain is a diffuse discomfort that may be difficult to localize.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiation usually is associated with causes of pain that are uncommon in children. As an example, the pain of myocardial ischemia may radiate to the neck, throat, lower jaw, teeth, upper extremity, or shoulder. Other unusual causes include acute cholecystitis, which can present with right shoulder pain (although concomitant right upper quadrant or epigastric pain is more typical), aortic dissection, which may be associated with chest pain that radiates between the scapulae, or pericarditis that can radiate to the left shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Precipitating factors</strong> &ndash; The patient should be asked about factors that induce or make the pain worse:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deep breathing may exacerbate chest pain of musculoskeletal origin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain made worse by swallowing likely is of esophageal origin. Discomfort that occurs with eating also may suggest upper gastrointestinal disease. History of a choking spell or witnessed foreign body ingestion, especially in a preschool child warrants evaluation for an esophageal foreign body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest discomfort provoked by exertion often has a cardiac or respiratory cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pleuritic chest pain is worsened by inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest pain that increases when lying supine and decreases when sitting suggests pericarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain associated with coronary artery anomalies typically occurs with exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> &ndash; Associated symptoms may help determine etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever, especially when associated with tachypnea or cough, may suggest a respiratory infection. Fever is also present in patients with pericarditis, myocarditis, or Kawasaki disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dyspnea may indicate pulmonary disorders, including pathology of the airways, lung parenchyma, or pulmonary vasculature, or be a sign of cardiac disease. In addition to chest pain, for example, patients with pulmonary embolism can develop dyspnea, hypoxemia, apprehension, cough, and diaphoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Bruises associated with trauma sometimes are seen. However, serious underlying thoracic injury can occur without obvious chest wall bruising. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intrathoracic injuries in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examination should also include palpation of the costochondral junctions, the insertion site of the pectoralis major muscle group (by grasping the head of the muscle between the examiner's fingers and thumb), the inframammary area, and other regions of the chest where pain is reported. In patients with costochondritis, involvement of the costochondral junctions often is asymmetric, with the left side more frequently affected. The diagnosis is confirmed when palpation reproduces the discomfort. Provocative maneuvers for costochondritis include horizontal arm traction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96607 \">figure 1</a>) and the &ldquo;crowing rooster&rdquo; maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96606 \">figure 2</a>).

Tender subareolar masses may also be palpable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast disorders in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Breast pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lungs</strong> &ndash; Signs of a respiratory etiology may include tachypnea and respiratory distress. Patients with respiratory distress warrant urgent assessment of airway and breathing and administration of supplemental oxygen. Airway management in patients with signs of impending respiratory failure should be initiated prior to full evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress in children: Emergency evaluation and initial stabilization&quot;, section on 'Initial rapid assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to lung pathology, tachypnea with or without wheezing can also be an important sign of heart failure in children with myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac causes of chest pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H23884780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diminished breath sounds over affected areas of the lung raises suspicion for pneumothorax. Rales or tubular breath sounds suggest pneumonia whereas wheezing may be audible in patients with asthma. Pneumomediastinum or esophageal rupture may produce subcutaneous emphysema that is detected as crepitus on palpation of the supraclavicular or neck region. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H876681638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Spontaneous pneumothorax'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H876681698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Respiratory'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperventilation, associated with chest pain of psychogenic origin, may be present at the time of the examination. Patients will display light, shallow breathing with normal lung sounds and oxygenation. If the patient is not actively hyperventilating, it may be possible to reproduce the chest pain by asking the patient to hyperventilate.

Some patients have none of these findings.

Coarctation of the aorta is associated with elevated blood pressure in the arms and a lower blood pressure in the legs, and frequently with a systolic murmur on the back between the scapulae. If the coarctation is long-standing (present for more than five to seven years), collateral vessels may form that connect the upper and lower portions of the aorta; these vessels create a continuous murmur over the lateral aspect of the ribs.

Very rapid tachycardia for age (180 to 240 beats per minute in older children and adolescents) suggests supraventricular tachycardia, including Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Exposure to a variety of sympathomimetic agents, including cocaine, amphetamines, bath salts, and synthetic cannabinoids may cause sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety.

The pain typically improves with sitting up and leaning forward. Signs of pericarditis depend upon the size of the pericardial effusion. Patients with a small effusion typically have an audible pericardial friction rub, caused by rubbing together of the inflamed parietal and visceral pericardial surfaces. The rub often is continuous in systole and diastole. It is easier to hear with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient is sitting and leaning forward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A rub will not be heard if the effusion is large because the two pericardial surfaces of the pericardium are not in contact with each other. A large effusion may result in cardiac tamponade, manifested by a narrow pulse pressure, elevated pulsus paradoxus (&gt;10 mmHg), elevated jugular venous pressure, distant heart sounds, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Myocarditis </strong>&ndash; Myocarditis may on occasion present with chest pain. Signs of myocarditis include tachycardia, diminished heart sounds, a gallop rhythm, and a murmur of mitral regurgitation, usually accompanied by fever. Patients often complain of dyspnea and fatigue and may display tachypnea on examination. Tachycardia out of proportion to age and poor perfusion can be findings of myocarditis in children with an otherwise normal examination.

While troponin is highly specific for myocardial injury, it is not specific for ACS as the cause. As a result, if troponin testing is applied indiscriminately in broad populations with a low pretest probability of thrombotic disease, the positive predictive value for ACS is greatly diminished.
