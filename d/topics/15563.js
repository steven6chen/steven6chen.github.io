One of the stereoisomers, S-citalopram (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>), more potently inhibits reuptake of serotonin compared with the other stereoisomer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399779781\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSRIs appear to treat depression by increasing serotonergic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They are selective in that they have relatively little affinity for other types of receptors.</p><p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is an indoleamine neurotransmitter released in the brain from neurons originating in the brainstem raphe nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain involves at least 14 different types of pre- and postsynaptic serotonin receptors. All SSRIs potently decrease the action of the presynaptic serotonin reuptake pump, by 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. This increases the length of time that serotonin is available in the synapse and increases postsynaptic serotonin receptor occupancy. </p><p>However, reuptake inhibition does not appear to be sufficient for the treatment of depression. Reuptake inhibition occurs soon after SSRIs are started, and the full therapeutic effects of SSRIs may not appear for three to eight (or more) weeks after treatment has started. The full clinical response may require additional &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; effects. As an example of one such effect, the initial increase in synaptic serotonin eventually leads to increased production of neuroprotective proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Bc1-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, treatment with an SSRI for weeks modifies the serotonergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The relatively benign side effect profile of the SSRIs is due to their selectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. None of the SSRIs significantly affect alpha-adrenergic, histaminic, or cholinergic receptors, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, which weakly antagonizes the cholinergic receptor. Side effects that occur with SSRI treatment are attributed to their effects upon serotonin receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399779788\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the SSRIs are well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-11</a>]. </p><p>SSRIs are well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and reach peak plasma levels within one to eight hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Food generally does not affect absorption. Following absorption, SSRIs bind to proteins and are widely distributed throughout the body, including the brain, because they are lipophilic.</p><p>Metabolism and elimination occur largely in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Metabolism of each SSRI except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a> produces pharmacologically active metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> yields a metabolite (norfluoxetine) that potently inhibits reuptake of serotonin and has antidepressant activity. </p><p>The elimination half-life for the SSRIs is approximately one day (ranging from about 20 to 30 hours), except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. The half-life for fluoxetine ranges from 1 to 3 days, and for its metabolite norfluoxetine, 4 to 16 days.

Additional information about each drug and its inhibition of hepatic enzymes can be found in the individual drug information topics in the section on <span class=\"nowrap\">Metabolism/Transport</span> Effects. </p><p>Among the numerous potential drug-drug interactions that may occur with SSRIs is the interaction between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>. Tamoxifen is used to treat or prevent recurrence of breast cancer, and is a prodrug that is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 to the active metabolite. Although a review concluded that paroxetine and fluoxetine should not be prescribed to patients receiving tamoxifen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], more recent studies indicate that the clinical significance of the drug-drug interactions is not clear.

Although many observational studies have found an association between SSRIs and an increased risk of abnormal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>], the low quality of this evidence leads us to suggest that clinicians should generally not change their practice with regard to using SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Associations between SSRIs and bleeding that are found in observational studies may be confounded by many factors, such as intracranial small vessel disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol abuse. In addition, depressed patients who received SSRIs may have been compared with healthy controls; thus, observed associations between SSRI exposure and bleeding may be confounded by exposure to depression (confounding by indication). &#160; </p><p>Bleeding complications of SSRIs identified in observational studies include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke, postpartum hemorrhage, and intraoperative bleeding, as well as more minor problems such as easy bruising, petechiae and purpura, epistaxis, and hematomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. The association between SSRI exposure and abnormal bleeding across multiple studies appears to be more consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding than stroke. In addition, the risk of bleeding in observational studies was amplified in patients who were taking other medications that can cause bleeding, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>), other antiplatelet agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>), or anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/63,69-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,69-72</a>]. Among the different SSRIs, there is little indication that any specific SSRI is more strongly associated with bleeding.</p><p>The biological plausibility of the association between SSRIs and increased bleeding is supported by the finding that SSRIs can inhibit serotonin uptake into platelets and decrease intraplatelet serotonin concentrations, which may affect platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>].

By contrast, a separate subgroup analysis found that the risk of bleeding was comparable for patients who took SSRIs plus NSAIDS plus acid suppressing drugs and for patients who were not exposed to SSRIs.

The six commonly available SSRIs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>. (See <a href=\"#H399779766\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSRIs inhibit the serotonin reuptake pump and increase postsynaptic serotonin receptor occupancy. This initial action may cause subsequent changes involved in treating depression. SSRIs are selective in that they have relatively little affinity for other types of receptors. (See <a href=\"#H399779781\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacodynamics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SSRIs may inhibit hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize other medications and cause drug-drug interactions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Citalopram</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> inhibit liver enzymes less than other SSRIs and are thus the SSRIs of choice for situations in which drug-drug interactions are a concern. (See <a href=\"#H399780619\" class=\"local\">'Drug-drug interactions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSRIs should generally be started at their minimal effective dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>). A process of trial and error is used to find the effective dose. Dose adjustments are made according to patient response, tolerability, and clinical urgency. Clinicians should not prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> at doses that exceed 40 mg per day because of dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. In addition, the dose should not exceed 20 mg per day in patients with risk factors for increased serum concentrations of citalopram, including hepatic impairment, age &gt;60 years, CYP2C19 variants that slowly metabolize citalopram, and concomitant medications that inhibit CYP2C19. (See <a href=\"#H74872026\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31651631\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common SSRI side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 2</a>) include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, weight gain, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth. In addition, observational studies suggest SSRIs may increase the risk of diabetes, abnormal bleeding, and bone loss.
