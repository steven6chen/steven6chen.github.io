These infections are characterized clinically by fulminant tissue destruction, systemic signs of toxicity, and high mortality. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment must include early surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Several different names have been used to describe the various forms of necrotizing infections; this is related in part to naming based on clinical features rather than surgical or pathologic findings. The degree of suspicion should be high since the clinical presentation is variable and prompt intervention is critical.

Necrotizing infection may be categorized based on microbiology and presence or absence of gas in the tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116305 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Distinguishing necrotizing fasciitis from necrotizing myositis may be difficult as skeletal muscle and fascia are involved in both syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Necrotizing myositis primarily involves skeletal muscle, whereas necrotizing fasciitis primarily involves fascia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650406663\"><span class=\"h2\">Necrotizing fasciitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection of the deep soft tissues that results in progressive destruction of the muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat. Infection typically spreads along the muscle fascia due to its relatively poor blood supply; muscle tissue is frequently spared because of its generous blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Development of anesthesia may precede the appearance of skin necrosis and provide a clue to the presence of necrotizing fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Initially, the overlying tissue can appear unaffected; therefore, necrotizing fasciitis is difficult to diagnose without direct visualization of the fascia.</p><p>Necrotizing fasciitis may be divided into two microbiologic categories: polymicrobial (type I) and monomicrobial infection (type II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymicrobial (type I) necrotizing infection is caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Typically, at least one anaerobic species (most commonly <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Clostridium</em>, or <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>) is isolated in combination with Enterobacteriaceae (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>) and one or more facultative anaerobic streptococci (other than group A <em>Streptococcus </em>[GAS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Obligate aerobes (such as <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>) are rarely components of such mixed infections. Uncommonly, fungi (predominately <em>Candida</em> species) are recovered in polymicrobial (type I) necrotizing infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>Fournier's gangrene </strong>is caused by facultative organisms (<em>E. coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, enterococci) along with anaerobes (<em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Fusobacterium</em>, <em>Clostridium</em>, anaerobic or microaerophilic streptococci) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3846414689\" class=\"local\">'Involved sites'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>Necrotizing infection of the head and neck</strong> is usually caused by mouth anaerobes (such as Fusobacteria, anaerobic streptococci, <em>Bacteroides</em>, and spirochetes). (See <a href=\"#H3846414689\" class=\"local\">'Involved sites'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other terms for polymicrobial (type I) infection include synergistic necrotizing cellulitis and progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monomicrobial (type II) necrotizing infection is usually caused by GAS or other beta-hemolytic streptococci. Infection may also occur as a result of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Infection with no clear portal of entry occurs in about half of cases; in such circumstances, the pathogenesis of infection likely consists of hematogenous translocation of GAS from the throat (asymptomatic or symptomatic pharyngitis) to a site of blunt trauma or muscle strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">M protein is an important virulence determinant of GAS. Necrotizing infection caused by GAS strains with M types 1 and 3 is associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in about 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. These GAS strains can produce pyrogenic exotoxins, which induce cytokine production, likely contributing to shock, tissue destruction, and organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>].

Infections due to these pathogens typically occur in the setting of traumatic injury associated with sea water or fresh water, respectively. Other risk factors for necrotizing infection due to <em>V. vulnificus</em> include cirrhosis and ingestion of contaminated oysters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Fournier's gangrene is a form of polymicrobial (type I) infection. Fournier's gangrene typically begins abruptly with severe pain and may spread rapidly to the anterior abdominal wall and the gluteal muscles. Men are more commonly affected than women.

Fasciitis spread to the face (22 percent), lower neck (56 percent), and mediastinum (40 percent). In a separate study, 28 percent of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck developed mediastinitis; factors that contributed to mediastinal involvement included prior corticosteroid use, infection by gas-producing microbes, and a pharyngeal focus of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Cervical (head and neck) necrotizing fasciitis is usually a polymicrobial (type I) infection. However, monomicrobial (type II) infection due to group A <em>Streptococcus</em> can also occur.

Fever may be present, but cellulitis is generally not associated with hemodynamic instability or exquisite tenderness. Elevations in serum CK or AST concentrations suggest deep infection involving muscle or fascia (as opposed to cellulitis).

Distinguishing features are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F115267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115267 \">table 2</a>). The distinction is important because inappropriate surgical debridement of pyoderma gangrenosum can cause extension of the lesion, and inappropriate administration of immunosuppressive therapy may worsen necrotizing fasciitis.

Both gas gangrene and polymicrobial (type I) necrotizing soft tissue infection are associated with gas in the tissues. In gas gangrene, the Gram stain typically demonstrates gram-positive rods, while, in polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis, the Gram stain typically demonstrates mixed aerobes and anaerobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116305 \">table 1</a>).

These conditions differ in that pyomyositis is characterized by abscess formation in skeletal muscle, while necrotizing myositis is characterized by gangrenous necrosis.

These infections are characterized clinically by fulminant tissue destruction, systemic signs of toxicity, and high mortality. They may be categorized based on microbiology and presence or absence of gas in the tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116305\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116305 \">table 1</a>). Risk factors for NSTI include skin or mucosal breach, traumatic wounds, and diabetes or other immunosuppressing conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3864839350\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection of the deep soft tissues that results in progressive destruction of the muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat. Infection may be polymicrobial (type I) or monomicrobial (type II) (see <a href=\"#H650406663\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polymicrobial (type I) necrotizing infection is caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It usually occurs in older adults <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in individuals with underlying comorbidities including diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monomicrobial (type II) necrotizing infection is most commonly caused by group A <em>Streptococcus </em>(and other beta-hemolytic streptococci). It may occur in any age group and in individuals with no underlying comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing myositis is an infection of skeletal muscle typically caused by group A <em>Streptococcus </em>(and other beta-hemolytic streptococci). Necrotizing cellulitis is typically caused by anaerobic pathogens and may be divided into two types: clostridial (usually caused by <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>) and nonclostridial (caused by polymicrobial infection). (See <a href=\"#H1339346879\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing myositis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H233742482\" class=\"local\">'Necrotizing cellulitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of NSTI include erythema, edema extending beyond the visible erythema, severe pain (out of proportion to exam findings in some cases), fever, crepitus, and skin bullae, necrosis, or ecchymosis. Systemic toxicity may be observed. Necrotizing infection most commonly involves the extremities (lower extremity more commonly than upper extremity) and usually presents acutely. Other presentations of necrotizing fasciitis include involvement of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), head and neck region, and neonatal infection. (See <a href=\"#H2371333042\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSTI should be suspected in patients with soft tissue infection (erythema, edema, warmth) and signs of systemic illness (fever, hemodynamic instability) in association with crepitus, rapid progression of clinical manifestations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe pain (out of proportion to skin findings in some cases) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116424\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116424 \">algorithm 1</a>). The diagnosis of necrotizing infection is established via surgical exploration of the soft tissues in the operating room, with physical examination of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascial planes, and muscle. (See <a href=\"#H2611694952\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic imaging studies can be useful to help determine whether necrotizing infection is present but should not delay surgical intervention when there is crepitus on examination or rapid progression of clinical manifestations. The best initial radiographic imaging exam is computed tomography scan. Presence of gas in the tissues (seen most frequently in the setting of polymicrobial [type I] necrotizing fasciitis or clostridial infection) is highly specific for NSTI and should prompt immediate surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1770115080\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of necrotizing infection consists of early and aggressive surgical exploration and debridement of necrotic tissue, together with broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy and hemodynamic support. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, empiric treatment of necrotizing infection should consist of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, including activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. Acceptable empiric antibiotic regimens include (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A carbapenem or beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor <strong>plus</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An agent with activity against methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> <strong>plus</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> (for its antitoxin effects against toxin-elaborating strains of streptococci and staphylococci)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Issues related to surgical management of NSTI and hemodynamic support are discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection, we suggest not administering intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2540005751\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close contacts of a patient with necrotizing infection due to group A <em>Streptococcus</em> can become colonized with a virulent strain. For highly susceptible individuals (such as immunocompromised individuals or patients with recent surgery) who are close household contacts of a patient with necrotizing infection due to group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, we suggest administration of prophylaxis with oral penicillin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
