Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters allow for the safe infusion of medications, hydration fluids, blood products, and nutritional supplements.</p><p>This topic will discuss the indications, contraindications, performance, and complications of peripheral venous catheter placement without the use of ultrasound guidance. Emergency vascular access in children, peripheral venous catheter placement under ultrasound guidance, and central venous catheter placement are reviewed separately.

As examples, IV hydration and nutritional support can be given to a patient with severe vomiting or abdominal pain from a surgical condition. Certain medications are more effective when given intravenously due to rapid onset or increased bioavailability. Some clinical situations, such as cardiac arrest, require treatment using IV medications; blood products must be given intravenously. In some instances, IV catheters are left in place when medications are given intermittently over a longer period (eg, long-term antibiotic therapy) or in case of a potential emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755089\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for peripheral versus central venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to obtain peripheral rather than central venous access depends upon clinical circumstances. In general, peripheral catheters are preferred when IV access is required for shorter periods, when direct access to the central circulation is unnecessary, and when smaller gauge catheters suffice. Peripheral access is generally safer, easier to obtain, and less painful than central access. In patients taking anticoagulants, peripheral access allows for direct compression of puncture sites and fewer hematoma-related complications compared with the sites used for central venous catheters.</p><p>Central venous catheters are often preferred in patients receiving sclerosing medications that can damage peripheral veins or being treated with vasopressors, which can cause injury if extravasated. Central venous access may also be preferable in patients with severe volume depletion or in whom peripheral venous catheter placement has a low likelihood of success (ie, frequent users of illicit IV drugs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103243\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15275188\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few contraindications to the placement of peripheral venous catheters. Most concern problems with cannulation at a specific site. The sole absolute contraindication is when appropriate therapy can be provided by a less invasive route (eg, orally). Guidelines about appropriate sites for the placement of peripheral venous catheters are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H27755111\" class=\"local\">'Site selection'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clinicians consider the use of a limb with a significant motor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory deficit for placement of a peripheral IV catheter to be relatively contraindicated. Anecdotal evidence suggests that paralyzed extremities and limbs with significant weakness may be at slightly increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. However, there is no clear evidence that routine placement of a standard length peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter increases this baseline risk, especially in upper extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Placement of a peripheral IV catheter in a limb with a significant sensory deficit may delay detection of fluid or medication infiltration if the patient is unable to feel the discomfort caused by such infiltration. In general, we think that a limb with a significant motor or sensory deficit may be used safely for temporary placement of a peripheral IV catheter, provided the limb is monitored closely, until a preferable site for venous access can be found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52513128\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipated difficulty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to observational data, factors associated with difficulty placing a peripheral IV catheter in an adult include obesity, underweight, clinician inexperience, and clinician judgement of poor peripheral venous access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In a prospective study of IV placement in 563 consecutive emergency department patients, difficult venous access was predicted by paucity or absence of visible or palpable peripheral veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>If difficulty is anticipated or apparent when it is critical to obtain access, alternative approaches include intraosseous catheters, and possibly central venous catheters or peripheral catheter placement under ultrasound guidance depending upon clinical circumstances and available equipment.

In such cases, a small syringe filled with a flushing solution (eg, isotonic saline) is required to ensure the catheter's patency. </p><p>Other materials that may be needed when obtaining peripheral venous access include a topical anesthetic to minimize the pain of venipuncture, fluid warmers, and pressure infusers. If a catheter is placed over a joint, a splint may help to reduce movement and decrease the risk of dislodging the catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209344\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous (IV) catheters in common use today are pliable plastic tubes with an inner needle obturator (over-the-needle catheters) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55791\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55791 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Steel needles, such as butterfly needles, may be appropriate for blood draws, but should not be used for prolonged IV therapy due to the risk of vein injury and extravasation of fluids or medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Catheter material and the risk of phlebitis and infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Catheter material'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Phlebitis'</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral catheters range in size from 24 (smaller) to 14 (larger) gauges. Twenty-two to 20 gauge catheters are typically used for medication administration or infusion of moderate volumes of fluid. Infusion of large fluid volumes or blood products typically requires larger sizes (eg, 18 to 16 gauge). The smallest appropriate needle size should be used, as smaller catheters cause less trauma and phlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Catheters range in length from 2 to 3 cm (0.75 to 1.25 inches). Longer catheters (5 to 15 cm; 2 to 6 inches) may be beneficial for placement proximal to the antecubital fossa by reducing the risk of dislodgement when the patient moves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. To reduce the risk of injury, the needles in most catheters in current use can be retracted into a needle guard by pushing a button on the flashback chamber after the catheter is inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755111\"><span class=\"h1\">SITE SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209385\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many sites can be used for peripheral intravenous (IV) access, and they vary in their ease of cannulation and potential risks. Site selection varies according to clinical circumstances, expected duration of treatment, and the condition of the extremities.</p><p>In general, distal extremity sites should be used first, saving more proximal sites for subsequent cannulation, if needed. Placing an IV in a vein distal to a site that was previously punctured can lead to extravasation of fluids and hematoma formation. Larger veins are generally more easily cannulated and are preferable to smaller veins in the same region. Veins of the upper extremity are preferred due to the increased risk of thrombosis and thrombophlebitis with venous cannulation of the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11</a>]. Whenever possible, avoid using the dominant upper extremity.</p><p>Sites over joints (eg, antecubital fossa) should be avoided if possible due to the increased risk of catheter dislodgement and kinking, and the need to then immobilize the joint to reduce these risks. Peripheral IV catheters used for trauma resuscitation are an exception to this rule and are routinely placed in the larger veins of the antecubital fossa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Circulation'</a>.)</p><p>Contraindications to the use of a particular extremity include the presence of an arteriovenous fistula (catheter can alter venous blood flow or damage the fistula) and a history of mastectomy or lymph node dissection (catheter can exacerbate impaired lymphatic drainage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Venous catheter placement should be avoided at a site that may interfere with an anticipated procedure (eg, an injured extremity that requires surgery).</p><p>Veins that are firm to palpation may be sclerosed (eg, from IV drug abuse) and should be avoided as should veins with evidence of phlebitis or thrombosis. Venous puncture at sites where catheter placement was recently attempted should also be avoided, especially if a hematoma formed (ie, vein was &quot;blown&quot;) following the previous attempt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial lower extremity veins&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.) </p><p>Placement of an IV through infected tissue is not advised due to the risk of introducing a systemic infection. In addition, peripheral IV catheters should not be placed through burned tissue or in extremities with massive edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209392\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and vein selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The veins of the dorsum of the hand are often the most accessible sites for peripheral cannulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70665\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70665 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55596 \">figure 2</a>). As an example, the dorsal metacarpal veins are usually visible and palpable and make good sites for IV catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These veins merge into the dorsal venous network (or arch) and then form the cephalic vein, which runs along the lateral distal forearm. The cephalic vein is usually visible and palpable and therefore another good site for cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The volar forearm also contains several veins that can be cannulated, including the median antebrachial veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The antecubital fossa, though not a primary choice for nonemergent IV access, contains several accessible veins, including the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These veins are usually large and easily cannulated and provide a useful option when emergent IV access is needed. Veins in the proximal arm are more safely cannulated using ultrasound guidance. They include the more proximal portions of the basilic, cephalic, and brachial veins. If catheter placement is attempted in these proximal veins without ultrasound guidance, there is an increased risk of arterial puncture and nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the arm, leg and neck veins can be used to obtain peripheral IV access. The external jugular vein, which drains into the subclavian, is a large vein in the neck that is easily cannulated, even in patients with severe volume depletion or otherwise poor extremity access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53785 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Placing the patient's bed in a head-down (ie, Trendelenburg) position or having them perform a Valsalva maneuver often enlarges the vein making cannulation easier. When inserting the catheter, avoid the valves in the external jugular vein, which can impair function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27755140\" class=\"local\">'Vein dilation'</a> below.)</p><p>Veins of the leg, including the greater saphenous vein at the level of the medial malleolus and the dorsal metatarsal veins on the dorsum of the foot, are often accessible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, lower extremity sites should be used only if veins in the arm cannot be cannulated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73200\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73200 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2209385\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755118\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755126\"><span class=\"h2\">Consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implied (presumed) consent is felt adequate for a procedure such as placement of a peripheral venous catheter where the risks and benefits are common knowledge to &quot;persons of average intelligence&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For IV catheter placement, consent can be assumed if the patient extends their arm for the procedure to be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some patients may be apprehensive about IV placement and in nonemergent cases, it is important to take some time to explain the reason for venous catheterization, risks and benefits, alternatives, expected duration of therapy, and the pain involved, and to allow the patient an opportunity to ask questions.</p><p>Obtaining IV access in uncooperative patients is challenging. It is important to determine why the patient will not or cannot cooperate. If the patient lacks the capacity to make reasoned medical decisions and has a potentially life or limb-threatening condition requiring urgent intervention, the use of restraints may be necessary. Chemical restraint is preferred, but temporary use of physical restraints may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient is alert and has capacity but will not cooperate due to fear or anxiety, provide reassurance. Administration of a short-acting anxiolytic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) prior to the procedure may be beneficial, as may allowing a parent, family member, or friend to help comfort the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755133\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keep the patient warm and relaxed; both excessive cold and anxiety stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and can cause vasoconstriction of superficial vessels, thus making cannulation more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients who are excessively anxious may benefit from a small dose of a short-acting anxiolytic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) prior to the procedure.</p><p>Excessive hair around catheter sites may be clipped to ease cannulation and improve dressing adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Do not shave hair because this increases the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If a topical anesthetic is used, allow sufficient time for it to take effect. If possible, use the patient's nondominant extremity to reduce inconvenience and the effect of extravasation, should it occur.</p><p>The practitioner placing the IV and the patient should both be comfortable throughout the procedure. If possible, place patients in a supine position to avoid lightheadedness from pain or the sight of blood. Place the extremity with the venipuncture site on a stable surface below heart level to allow gravity to enhance venous dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209949\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before venipuncture is attempted, take appropriate steps to protect the patient and healthcare worker from infection. Wash your hands, and wear clean gloves and protective eye wear. Do not touch the puncture site after it has been cleaned with an appropriate solution (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>). Prevention of infection associated with IV catheters, including cleaning agents and sterile technique, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755140\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple methods for enhancing venous dilation to facilitate cannulation have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Placing the anticipated cannulation site below the level of the heart uses gravity to reduce venous return, which causes blood to pool and veins to distend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Lightly tapping or gently stroking the vein along its length in a proximal to distal direction causes venous distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Another simple, effective way to dilate veins consists of having the patient alternately clench and relax their fist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Elevating skin temperatures to 39 to 42&deg;C at the cannulation site causes venous dilation. This can be accomplished by placing the site in warm water or by applying a warm compress (eg, warm moist cloths, warming packs, heated carbon fiber mitts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/23,24,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,27-29</a>].</p><p>Proximal compression, most often using a thin rubber tourniquet placed 5 to 10 cm proximal to the anticipated venipuncture site, impedes venous return and enhances venous dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Tourniquet pressures should be greater than venous pressure, but less than arterial pressure to allow arterial inflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>]. Other devices similar to tourniquets may be used, such as blood pressure cuffs and Esmarch bandages. If a blood pressure cuff is used, inflate it no higher than the diastolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Avoid excessive pressure and prolonged application of the tourniquet to reduce the risk of vein injury and hematoma formation, especially in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>An Esmarch bandage is similar to the rubber tourniquets commonly used, but is 7.5 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) in width, and each roll is several hundred centimeters long. The Esmarch bandage is placed at the proximal end of the involved limb, and the limb is then wrapped circumferentially in a proximal to distal direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This squeezes blood from the proximal to the distal end of the limb, thereby dilating the veins.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroglycerin</a> ointment applied to the venipuncture site and left for two minutes causes venous dilation and does not appear to cause deleterious changes in blood pressure, even in hypotensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>For the placement of larger intravenous (IV) catheters, a technique for dilating veins similar to Bier block regional anesthesia has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After a small gauge IV catheter is placed, usually in the hand, the tourniquet is left in place. A volume of isotonic crystalloid (60 to 300 mL) is then infused. This fluid distends the surrounding collateral veins, allowing for placement of a larger gauge catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2663664\"><span class=\"h2\">Tools for locating veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When no veins are readily visible or palpable, any of several transillumination devices can be used to locate veins for cannulation. One such device uses infrared light, which reflects off tissue surrounding the veins, but not the vein itself (eg, The VeinViewer, Luminetx, Memphis, Tennessee) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other devices use a light frequency that causes deoxygenated venous blood to appear darker than surrounding tissues (eg, Veinlite LED, TransLite, Sugarland, Texas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Nevertheless, topical and subcutaneous anesthetics reduce the pain and anxiety associated with IV catheter insertion, and they should be used whenever possible. Multiple methods are available for providing analgesia prior to venipuncture, including intradermal injection, topical medication, and technologies such as iontophoresis. A thorough discussion of topical anesthetics is found separately; a brief description of selected analgesic techniques for peripheral venous cannulation is provided here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intradermally injected local anesthetics are the traditional method of anesthetizing a puncture site. One percent buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> injected subcutaneously provides rapid anesthesia and does not appear to decrease successful catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This method reduces the pain from venipuncture, but involves a separate injection, which itself can cause pain, anxiety, and may distort puncture site anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. Avoid intradermal anesthetics that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, which can cause the vein to constrict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>A number of topical anesthetics can be used to reduce the pain of venipuncture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMLA, the eutectic mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a>, reduces pain but requires approximately one hour to achieve peak effect. If used, 1 to 2 g should be applied per 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of skin and then covered with an occlusive dressing. EMLA is generally safe, but can cause methemoglobinemia with prolonged use or in those who are predisposed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'EMLA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMX (formerly ELA-max) is a topical preparation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> encapsulated in liposomes, which are spherical, microscopic, phospholipid-based carriers that promote passage of the anesthetic through intact skin. LMX appears to have similar efficacy to EMLA in preventing pain from venipuncture, but takes only 30 minutes to exert its effect. Dosing is similar to EMLA: apply 1 to 2 g per 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of skin.

If time allows, topical agents are a good approach, but they may require 30 to 60 minutes to achieve maximum effect.</p><p>Iontophoresis, the application of a small electrical current to move ionized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> through intact skin, has been used to provide local analgesia. Iontophoresis provides pain relief from venipuncture within 10 to 20 minutes. The technique can cause minor skin irritation and blistering. Similarly, sonophoresis, the use of low frequency ultrasound to facilitate skin penetration of a local anesthetic, has been shown to be fast (15 to 20 seconds of ultrasound time followed by five minutes of local anesthetic application) and effective in reducing pain from venipuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. A disadvantage of such techniques is the need for relatively expensive equipment.</p><p>Researchers have assessed the use of a single pulse of an erbium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser to remove the stratum corneum, thereby improving the penetration of local anesthetic. While the technique was found to reduce the pain of IV cannulation in volunteers within minutes, the cost of the laser device is prohibitive (approximately USD $2000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755154\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER INSERTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755162\"><span class=\"h2\">Traditional percutaneous technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an appropriate site is selected, use the following technique to place the catheter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a tourniquet proximal to the intended site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62529\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62529 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse the skin, being careful not to contaminate the puncture site after the skin is cleansed.

This reduces movement of the vein when inserting the needle. Avoid applying excessive pressure, which will collapse the vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the catheter in the dominant hand between the thumb and forefinger with the bevel facing upwards (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57369\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57369 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approach the vein with the needle at a low angle, generally about 10 to 30 degrees from the skin surface. Puncture the skin, and enter the vein using a slow, smooth, continuous movement. A flash of blood in the flash back chamber of the catheter indicates that the needle has entered the vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance the catheter another 1 to 2 mm to ensure that the catheter tip, which sits back slightly from the needle lumen, lies completely within the vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70200\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70200 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the tip of the dominant index finger against the small tab that extends up from the top of the hub of the catheter. Advance the catheter into the vein by extending the dominant index finger, thereby exerting pressure against the small tab with the fingertip. Maintain slight traction on the vein with the nondominant hand to prevent vein movement while the catheter advances. If the catheter is within the vessel lumen, it should advance easily and relatively painlessly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82130 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you cannot advance the catheter, it has either been advanced too far through the posterior wall of the vein, or the needle entered the vein but the catheter did not. If you suspect the former situation, withdraw the needle slightly until you see a good blood flash in the hub, and then try advancing the catheter. If you suspect the latter situation, advance the needle slightly, and then try to advance the catheter. In many cases, you must abort the attempt at cannulation if these problems arise, and try a different site, proximal to the first if the same extremity is used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, the catheter is in the lumen of the vein but cannot be advanced because it lies against a valve or tortuous portion of the vein. If you suspect this, attach a syringe filled with isotonic saline to the catheter, and gently infuse fluid through the catheter while slowly advancing it. This problem can often be avoided by using relatively straight veins and by avoiding valves which are often visible as small, circumscribed bulges in the vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the IV catheter is appropriately placed, venous blood will flow steadily from the catheter, and no swelling will occur at the puncture site. Once the catheter has been inserted, push the button on the needle guard to allow the needle to be retracted and to prevent inadvertent needle stick injuries. Remove the tourniquet, secure the catheter, and attach the appropriate IV set up. If correctly placed, medicine or fluids should infuse easily, without pain or swelling at the catheter site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56946\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56946 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If swelling occurs and extravenous placement is suspected, remove the catheter, and apply pressure at the puncture site to reduce hematoma formation; then place a dressing over the puncture site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadvertent arterial catheter placement usually causes a pulsatile flow of bright red blood and produces an arterial wave form when a transducer is attached.

In addition, movement of a poorly secured catheter may increase the risk of thrombophlebitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. If the IV catheter must be placed over a joint or in a dominant hand, it is often helpful to place a splint. Selection of an appropriate site for catheter placement is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H27755111\" class=\"local\">'Site selection'</a> above.)</p><p>Peripheral catheters can be secured with tape, prefabricated adhesive dressings (eg, Opsite, Smith and Nephew, United Kingdom; Tegaderm, 3M, St. Paul, Minnesota), suture, or specific IV securing devices. An unblinded randomized trial found that application of a drop of skin adhesive to the skin insertion site, and a drop under the catheter hub after insertion, followed by a standard tape and polyurethane dressing, resulted in lower rates of catheter failure (eg, dislodgement) at 48 hours, without significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The relative advantages and disadvantages of methods for securing an IV catheter are discussed separately.

This is not a concern when catheters are used for continuous infusions. Previously, dilute heparin solutions were used to flush catheters, thus the term &quot;heparin lock.&quot; Multiple studies have found that periodic flushing with isotonic saline is equally effective in maintaining the patency of catheters used for INT, while avoiding heparin-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. No studies address the issue of how best to flush peripheral catheters with saline, but common practice is to use 2 to 10 mL of isotonic saline after any IV medication is given or every 4 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209609\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an IV has been successfully placed, clinicians should periodically reassess the catheter to verify proper placement and patency. Examine the site carefully if any redness, edema, pain, tenderness, or problems infusing develop. Ultrasound can be used to verify the catheter's position.</p><p>Extravasation of fluid usually manifests as swelling and pain at the site and slow infusion rates. If IV fluids no longer infuse via gravity and the catheter cannot be flushed easily, a clot may have formed within the catheter. Do not flush the catheter forcefully because this can dislodge a clot into the circulation and should not be done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27755190\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performed properly, peripheral IV placement is a safe procedure with little serious risk. Nevertheless, a number of potential complications have been described.

Thrombophlebitis occurs in up to 15 percent of those with peripheral venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This risk can be reduced by avoiding lower extremity IV placement, minimizing catheter movement, placing the smallest suitable catheter size, and removing the catheter as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripheral-venous-access-in-adults/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Catheters placed in emergency circumstances are more prone to complications.</p><p>Peripheral venous catheters are thought to be rare causes of blood stream infections.
