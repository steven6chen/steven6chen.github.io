Most GBC is found incidentally in patients undergoing exploration for cholelithiasis; a tumor will be found in 1 to 2 percent of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy for GBC. However, even after complete resection, outcomes are poor, particularly for T3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> node-positive disease. High rates of both local and distant recurrence have prompted interest in adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer#H111057050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gallbladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gallbladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A high percentage of GBCs are initially unsuspected and detected at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. The next step for these patients (before adjuvant therapy) is additional surgery to remove lymph nodes and the segments of liver above the gallbladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer#H1159124143\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gallbladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Managing an incidental gallbladder cancer'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover adjuvant treatment for localized, resected GBC. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation, surgical treatment, and treatment for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic GBC are covered separately, as is adjuvant treatment after resection of cholangiocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gallbladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced, unresectable gallbladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS AND PATTERNS OF SPREAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current (eighth) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging criteria contains several changes compared with the earlier 2010 edition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most important are the subdivision of T2 disease into two categories based upon whether the tumor has arisen on the peritoneal or the hepatic side of the gallbladder, and a change from location-based definitions to a number-based N category assessment. Observed survival rates from a multicenter series of 437 cases of gallbladder cancer (GBC), stratified according to stage using the eighth edition staging criteria, are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110891 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p>The poor prognosis associated with GBC is related to the advanced stage at diagnosis, which is due both to the vagueness and nonspecificity of symptoms, and the anatomic position of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Locoregionally, GBC frequently extends directly to adjacent structures such as the liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, colon, omentum, or abdominal wall. Peritoneal carcinomatosis involving the upper abdomen may complicate the disease in patients with transmural or serosal penetration.</p><p>The risk of both lymphatic and distant metastases increases as T stage increases. As an example, in one report of 410 patients presenting for therapy of GBC with or without a prior operation elsewhere, lymph node metastases were present in 33, 58, and 69 percent of those with T2, T3, or T4 primary tumors; the corresponding rates for peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver metastases were 16, 42, and 79 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An important point is that the T staging for GBC differs from that of other sites in the gastrointestinal tract; while a T2 designation at other sites, such as the colon, indicates invasion of the muscular layer, this is classified as T1b disease for GBC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>).

In contrast to patients who have margin-positive resections, in whom locoregional recurrences predominate, the pattern of disease recurrence following complete resection of GBC is predominantly distant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], though locoregional recurrences also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 97 patients undergoing surgery for GBC (90 percent of whom had a margin-negative resection), isolated locoregional disease as the first site of failure occurred in 15 percent of cases, while an initial recurrence involving a distant site, with or without concomitant locoregional recurrence, occurred in 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective review of 166 patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent for GBC, 53 had a tumor recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The main patterns of recurrence were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Retroperitoneal lymph nodes (28 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intrahepatic (22 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Locoregional recurrence (hilum, bilioenteric anastomosis, hepatic resection margin; 20.9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peritoneum, lung, bone, and abdominal wall (totaling 15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other distant lymph nodes (14 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support adjuvant treatment in gallbladder cancer (GBC), and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials evaluating new strategies. One such trial, <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01313377?term=adjuvant+therapy+and+gallbladder+cancer&rank=2&amp;token=JzvOkKob7lfNFdo7Yq2kG7pkR7b/y2DX+FmM8Of/UzJleMRM7obm9Ks8kXnVZ/rrYY5v/thPQTXfVjN+uAsjn0YbBt2ftjaUWaEMt6ZhiyCOIp+ydbABjQT5zwT3AvJ99yCCOm+vRpCafvXNsbMSlg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2525\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ACTICCA-1</a>, is open to accrual in Europe, and eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll. </p><p>If protocol participation is not available or is declined, we suggest adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected &ge;T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>), node-positive, or margin-positive GBC. There is no consensus as to the optimal adjuvant approach. Given the high rate of distant recurrence, especially after completely resected GBC, we prefer six months of postoperative chemotherapy alone. The choice of drug (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [FU], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>) is empiric. An alternative approach combining concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy with four months of systemic chemotherapy with capecitabine plus gemcitabine (eg, as was used in Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] S0809 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107377 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]) is also acceptable, particularly for patients with margin-positive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-hepatobiliary-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for hepatobiliary cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who receive both chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, the optimal way to integrate chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy is uncertain. In general, it is preferable to start with chemotherapy first, based on the rationale that this approach may avoid radiation therapy (RT) for patients who are destined to develop early distant metastases and will not benefit from it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055863693\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no adequately powered randomized trials of adjuvant therapy to guide clinicians treating patients with GBC. The lack of prospective trials makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions as to the benefit of any adjuvant strategy. Nevertheless, several retrospective series and analyses from population-based databases, including the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, support benefit for adjuvant therapy. Given these findings and the poor prognosis of patients with &ge;T2 disease, adjuvant therapy is routinely recommended to patients with &ge;T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>), node-positive, or margin-positive tumors at many institutions. The following sections will review the available data on adjuvant therapy for a variety of adjuvant therapy strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation and chemoradiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of adjuvant RT, with or without concomitant chemotherapy, in the treatment of GBC is not well established. Among patients undergoing potentially curative resection, postoperative external beam RT can diminish local recurrence rates, but the lack of randomized trials makes it difficult to ascertain whether survival is favorably impacted. Nevertheless, impressions of a survival advantage have been reported in many (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-17</a>]) retrospective reports in which either RT alone, chemotherapy alone, or chemoradiotherapy (generally with a concomitant fluoropyrimidine) was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-28</a>]. In most cases, the authors concluded that the patients who underwent RT as a component of therapy (particularly at doses &ge;40 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29</a>] survived longer than those who did not. Benefit has varied according to tumor stage and extent of surgery. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional database of 291 patients with GBC who underwent curative-intent resection between 2000 and 2015 included 186 who underwent surgery alone, 61 who received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 44 who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In multivariate analysis, after controlling for T stage, tumor size, the rate of nodal positivity, lymphovascular invasion, positive resection margins, and postoperative complications, receipt of adjuvant therapy was associated with a significant survival benefit compared with surgery alone (hazard ratio [HR] for chemotherapy 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.65; HR for chemoradiotherapy 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.43). The survival benefit of adjuvant therapy was limited to those patients with high-risk features (American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">[AJCC]/Union</span> for International Cancer Control [UICC] T3 or 4 stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>), lymph node metastases, and macroscopically incomplete [R1] resection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 73 patients from the Mayo Clinic, no significant difference was seen in survival when patients receiving FU and RT were compared with those treated with surgery alone. However, when analyzed by stage, those patients with a higher stage and involved lymph nodes appeared to derive a significant benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This finding was also noted in a year 2012 meta-analysis of adjuvant strategies (predominantly RT and chemoradiotherapy) following resection of GBC. (See <a href=\"#H10305638\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy alone versus chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feasibility study conducted by SWOG supports the use of capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this nonrandomized study, 79 patients with resected extrahepatic biliary cancer or GBC received four cycles of gemcitabine (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenously on days 1 and 8) plus capecitabine (1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day on days 1 to 14) followed by concomitant capecitabine (1330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day) and RT (45 Gy to regional lymphatics, 54 to 59.4 Gy to tumor bed). The two-year survival rate was 65 percent. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse effects were neutropenia (44 percent), hand-foot syndrome (11 percent), and diarrhea (8 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit for chemoradiotherapy is further supported by an analysis derived from the NCDB of 5029 patients diagnosed with T1-3N0-1 GBC and treated with surgical resection from 2005 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Any adjuvant treatment was associated with improved three-year overall survival (HR for death with chemoradiotherapy was 0.47 [95% CI 0.39-0.58], for chemotherapy alone it was 0.77 [95% CI 0.61-0.97], and for RT alone it was 0.63 [95% CI 0.44-0.92]). When outcomes were analyzed according to T and N categories and margin status, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly improved survival in all categories except T1N0 and in patients with negative and positive margins. </p><p/><p>However, it is entirely possible that the apparent survival prolongation in all of these studies is attributable to selection of fitter and younger patients for adjuvant therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor biology, and thus, is unrelated to the use of RT or chemoradiotherapy. On the other hand, in the NCDB series reported above, advanced tumor stage, large primary tumor size, and involvement of lymph nodes (which would all predict for a worse outcome) were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving some form of adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10305289\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant IORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limited radiation tolerance of normal tissues surrounding the gallbladder led to the introduction of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), a technique that enables the delivery of a large dose of RT to the exact tumor area while protecting adjacent radiosensitive structures. Early reports suggest a benefit for IORT for both cure and palliation of GBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In one nonrandomized series, 17 of 27 patients undergoing resection for T4 or N1 (as defined by the 2010 tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] staging for GBC, in which N1 disease is defined by the location of the positive nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 3</a>)) GBC received IORT with or without postoperative external beam RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The three-year cumulative survival following resection plus IORT versus resection alone was 10 versus 0 percent. However, these are all retrospective series, and interpretation is subject to the same selection bias as with postoperative external beam RT. Given the lack of high-quality evidence to support benefit, the lack of widespread availability of IORT, and the logistics of intraoperative treatment, routine use of IORT cannot be considered a standard component of therapy for GBC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10305445\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of disease recurrence in completely resected GBC, in which the majority of patients have distant failure as a component of initial disease recurrence, suggests that chemotherapy might be a more rational adjuvant treatment strategy than RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1521999\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of disease recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p>However, the available data are inconclusive as to the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with resected GBC. Although most (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]) retrospective single-institution series and population-based database analyses have suggested some degree of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/17,30,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30,35-38</a>], few prospective randomized trials have been conducted, and the small number of patients with GBC enrolled in each of these trials compromises interpretation of the results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single multicenter trial of 140 patients from Japan comparing surgery with and without postoperative chemotherapy (two courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C plus infusional FU, followed by prolonged oral administration of FU until tumor progression) showed a modest benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Ninety percent of enrolled patients had node-positive disease. Among the 112 patients with GBC, the five-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients who received chemotherapy (26 versus 14 percent). However, the intent-to-treat analysis failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit for chemotherapy (median survival 16.4 versus 14.1 months). Furthermore, when stratified according to the type of surgery, the benefit of chemotherapy was statistically significant only for those undergoing a noncurative resection (9 versus 0 percent, p = 0.02) but not a curative resection (46 versus 31 percent, p = 0.15).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the phase III BILCAP trial, 447 patients with completely resected cholangiocarcinoma or GBC (n = 79, 18 percent) were randomly assigned to eight cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (1250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Overall, 207 (46 percent) had node-negative disease; the margins were negative (R0 resection) in 279 (62 percent) and microscopically positive (R1 resection) in 168 (38 percent). In a preliminary report presented at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), there was a potentially clinically meaningful, although not statistically significant, improvement in overall survival with capecitabine according to the intent to treat analysis (median 51 versus 36 months, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63-1.06). The benefit was statistically significant when ineligible patients (four in each group) and the 10 patients who received no postoperative capecitabine doses despite being randomized to receive the drug were eliminated from the analysis (per protocol analysis, median overall survival 53 versus 36 months, HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.97).

In contrast to patients who have margin-positive resections, in whom locoregional recurrences predominate, the pattern of disease recurrence following complete resection of GBC is both distant and local. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and patterns of spread'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) or concomitant chemoradiotherapy after resection of GBC has not been tested in randomized controlled trials. However, impressions of a survival advantage have been reported in many retrospective reports in which either radiation alone or chemoradiotherapy (generally with a concomitant fluoropyrimidine) was administered. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Radiation and chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The available data from randomized trials are inconclusive as to the benefit of chemotherapy in patients with resected GBC. However, at least two trials have demonstrated a potentially clinically meaningful, albeit statistically insignificant, survival benefit. (See <a href=\"#H10305445\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the paucity of high-quality evidence to support benefit, we suggest adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected &ge;T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110890 \">table 1</a>), node-positive, or margin-positive GBC (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There is no consensus as to the optimal adjuvant approach. Given the high rate of distant recurrence, especially after completely resected GBC, we prefer six months of postoperative chemotherapy alone. The choice of drug (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>) is empiric. An alternative approach combining concomitant fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy with four months of systemic chemotherapy with capecitabine plus gemcitabine (eg, as was used in Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] S0809 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107377 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-for-localized-resected-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]) is also acceptable, particularly for patients with margin-positive disease.
