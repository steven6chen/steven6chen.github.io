Doctors do not know what causes it. Eczema often happens in people who have allergies. It can also run in families. Another term for eczema is &quot;atopic dermatitis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477851475\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of eczema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of eczema can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bumps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that flakes off or forms scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76214 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Most people with eczema have their first symptoms before they turn 5. But eczema can look different in people of different ages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>babies</strong>, eczema tends to affect the front of the arms and legs, cheeks, or scalp. (The diaper area is not usually affected.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>older children and</strong> <strong>adults</strong>, eczema often affects the sides of the neck, the elbow creases, and the backs of the knees. Adults can also get it on their face, wrists, hands, and forearms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>older children and adults</strong>, the skin can become thick and dark. It might even forms scars from too much scratching.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477851482\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for eczema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. But doctors and nurses can tell if you have eczema it by looking at your skin and by asking you questions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477851489\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use unscented thick moisturizing creams and ointments to keep the skin from getting too dry. Also, try to avoid things that can make eczema worse, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having dry skin that has not been treated with moisturizing creams or ointments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being too hot or sweating too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being in very dry air</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress or worry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden temperature changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harsh soaps or cleaning products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfumes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wool or synthetic fabrics (like polyester)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477851496\"><span class=\"h1\">How is eczema treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are treatments that can relieve the symptoms of eczema. But the condition cannot be cured. Even so, about half of children with eczema grow out of it by the time they become adults. The treatments for eczema include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moisturizing creams or ointments</strong> &ndash; These products help keep your skin moist. In some cases, your doctor or nurse might suggest using a moist dressing over special creams or medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid creams and ointments</strong> &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids athletes some athletes take illegally. They go on the skin, and they relieve itching and redness. (In severe cases, you might need steroids in pills. But your doctor or nurse will want to take you off steroid pills as soon as possible. Even though these medicines help, they can also cause problems of their own.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines that change the way the immune system works</strong> &ndash; These medicines are only for people who do not get better with safer treatment options.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antihistamine pills</strong> &ndash; Antihistamines are the medicines people often take for allergies. Some people with eczema find that antihistamines relieve itching. Others do not think the medicines do any good. Many people with eczema find that itching is worst at night. That can make it hard to sleep. If you have this problem, talk with your doctor or nurse about it. He or she might recommend an antihistamine that can also help with sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Light therapy</strong> &ndash; Another treatment option is something called &quot;light therapy,&quot; but doctors do not use it much. During light therapy, your skin is exposed to a special kind of light called ultraviolet light. This therapy is usually done in a doctor's office.</p><p/><p>Light therapy can help with eczema but experts worry that it might increase a person's risk for skin cancer. Doctors usually recommend it for people who do not get better with other treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606566068\"><span class=\"h1\">Can eczema be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Babies who have a parent, brother, or sister with eczema have a higher risk of getting it, too. In these babies, using moisturizing creams or ointments (starting right after birth) might help prevent eczema during the first year. But doctors don't yet know if this also helps prevent eczema later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477851503\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Topical corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
