Many survivors live with significant disabilities, resulting in major socioeconomic burden as well. In 2000, the economic impact of TBI in the United States was estimated to be $9.2 billion in lifetime medical costs and $51.2 billion in productivity losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The focus of this topic is on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and classification of TBI.

Somewhat lower rates are reported in Europe (235 per 100,000) and Australia (322 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Rates of TBI are highest in the very young (age group zero to four years) and in adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years); there is another peak in incidence in the elderly (age &gt;65 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 78 percent of TBI are treated in the emergency department only; 19 percent of patients require hospitalization, and 3 percent are fatal. Most cases treated in emergency departments occur in the very young (ages zero to four years), while hospitalization rates are highest in patients older than 65 years.</p><p>As with most traumatic injuries, the incidence of TBI is significantly higher in men compared to women, with ratios that vary between 2.0 to 1 and 2.8 to 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. For severe TBI, the gender ratio is more pronounced, 3.5 to 1. Lower socioeconomic status, alcohol and drug use, and underlying psychiatric and cognitive disorders are also risk factors for head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Falls are the leading cause of TBI (particularly in older patients), followed by motor vehicle accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. In adolescents, sports-related injuries account for a substantial proportion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The proportion of TBI secondary to violence has risen over the past decade and now accounts for 7 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. TBI related to military combat has received increased attention in the years from 2002 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mechanistic aspects of combat-related trauma may differ from TBI related to other causes, as the former usually involve blast explosives.</p><p>Moderate and severe TBIs are associated with neurologic and functional impairments. The prevalence of long-term disability related to TBI in the United States is variably estimated to be between 3.2 to 5.3 million, or approximately 1 to 2 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic trends more specific to mild TBI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a heterogeneous disease. There are many different ways to categorize patients in terms of clinical severity, mechanism of injury, and pathophysiology, each of which may impact prognosis and treatment.</p><p>The best prognostic models ideally include all of the factors described below, as well as age, medical comorbidity, and laboratory parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, treatment decisions are likely best informed by considering these variables individually rather than as a lump score. Further efforts at improved classification are ongoing as these may help to refine treatment approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical severity scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TBI has traditionally been classified using injury severity scores; the most commonly used is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A GCS score of 13 to 15 is considered mild injury, 9 to 12 is considered moderate injury, and 8 or less as severe traumatic brain injury.</p><p>The GCS is universally accepted as a tool for TBI classification because of its simplicity, reproducibility, and predictive value for overall prognosis. However, it is limited by confounding factors such as medical sedation and paralysis, endotracheal intubation, and intoxication. These confounding issues are often particularly prominent in patients with a low GCS score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>An alternative scoring system, the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score, has been developed in order to attempt to obviate these issues, primarily by including a brainstem examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, this lacks the long track record of the GCS in predicting prognosis and is somewhat more complicated to perform, which may be a barrier for nonneurologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging scales</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic brain injury can lead to several pathologic injuries, most of which can be identified on neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skull fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural hematoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subdural hematoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraparenchymal hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral contusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraventricular hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal and diffuse patterns of axonal injury with cerebral edema</p><p/><p>Two currently used CT-based grading scales are the Marshall scale and the Rotterdam scale:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Marshall scale uses CT findings to classify injuries in six different categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67172\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67172 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Surgical treatment of primary brain injury lesions is central to the initial management of severe head injury. Likewise, the identification, prevention, and treatment of secondary brain injury is the principle focus of neurointensive care management for patients with severe TBI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary brain Injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary brain injury occurs at the time of trauma. Common mechanisms include direct impact, rapid <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/deceleration,</span> penetrating injury, and blast waves. Although these mechanisms are heterogeneous, they all result from external mechanical forces transferred to intracranial contents. The damage that results includes a combination of focal contusions and hematomas, as well as shearing of white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury) along with cerebral edema and swelling.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shearing mechanisms lead to diffuse axonal injury (DAI), which is visualized pathologically and on neuroimaging studies as multiple small lesions seen within white matter tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67573\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67573 \">image 1</a>). Patients with severe DAI typically present with profound coma without elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and often have poor outcome. This typically involves the gray-white junction in the hemispheres, with more severe injuries affecting the corpus callosum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> midbrain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (in particular diffusion tensor imaging) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) for detecting DAI, and the sensitivity of the test declines if delayed from the time of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal cerebral contusions are the most frequently encountered lesions. Contusions are commonly seen in the basal frontal and temporal areas, which are particularly susceptible due to direct impact on basal skull surfaces in the setting of <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/deceleration</span> injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53951\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53951 \">image 2</a>).

EDHs are lenticular-shaped and tend not to be associated with underlying brain damage. For this reason, patients who are found to have EDHs only on CT scan may have a better prognosis than individuals with other traumatic hemorrhage types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56200\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56200 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

While the coagulopathy may result from existing patient medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or antiplatelet agents, acute TBI is also thought to produce a coagulopathy through the systemic release of tissue factor and brain phospholipids into the circulation leading to inappropriate intravascular coagulation and a consumptive coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary brain Injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary brain injury in TBI is usually considered as a cascade of molecular injury mechanisms that are initiated at the time of initial trauma and continue for hours or days.

These various pathways of cellular injury have been the focus of extensive preclinical work into the development of neuroprotective treatments to prevent secondary brain injury in TBI. No clinical trials of these strategies have demonstrated clear benefit in patients.</p><p>However, a critical aspect of ameliorating secondary brain injury after TBI is the avoidance of secondary brain insults, which would otherwise be well-tolerated but can exacerbate neuronal injury in cells made vulnerable by the initial TBI.
