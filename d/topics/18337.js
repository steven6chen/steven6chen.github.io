The first two disorders will be reviewed here, while uric acid nephrolithiasis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uric acid is a weak organic acid and exists in one of two forms in biological systems, depending upon the prevailing pH (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>): the sparingly soluble undissociated uric acid form (the most highly represented form when the pH is less than 5.5), and the substantially more soluble urate anion form (the most highly represented form [98 percent] at the physiologic pH of 7.4). For the purposes of this discussion, we use the term &quot;uric acid&quot; to denote the poorly soluble undissociated form and the term &quot;urate&quot; to denote the soluble dissociated urate anion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE URIC ACID NEPHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute uric acid nephropathy (UAN) is characterized by acute oliguric or anuric renal failure due to uric acid precipitation within the tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is most often due to overproduction and overexcretion of uric acid in patients with lymphoma, leukemia, or a myeloproliferative disease (such as polycythemia vera), particularly after chemotherapy or radiation has induced rapid cell lysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Definition, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, etiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less frequent causes of UAN include tissue catabolism due to seizures or treatment of solid tumors, primary overproduction of uric acid due to the rare syndrome of severe hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome), or hyperuricosuria due to decreased urate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, as can occur with a Fanconi-like syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>] or with exercise in patients with familial renal hypouricemia due to an inherited deficiency in the activity of the urate-anion transporter URAT1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Lesch-Nyhan syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypouricemia-causes-and-clinical-significance#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypouricemia: Causes and clinical significance&quot;, section on 'Familial renal hypouricemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypouricemia-causes-and-clinical-significance#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypouricemia: Causes and clinical significance&quot;, section on 'Acute kidney injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UAN is typically associated with no symptoms referable to the urinary tract, although flank pain can occur if there is renal pelvic or ureteral obstruction. The diagnosis should be suspected when acute kidney injury develops in any of the above settings in association with marked hyperuricemia (plasma urate concentration generally above 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 893 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span>. This is in contrast to most other forms of acute kidney injury in which the plasma urate concentration usually is less than 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (714 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L),</span> except for prerenal disease in which there is an increase in proximal sodium and urate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The urinalysis in UAN may show many uric acid crystals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61827%7ENEPH%2F73642\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61827 graphicRef73642 \">picture 1A-B</a>), but can be relatively normal due to no output from the obstructed nephrons. Overexcretion of uric acid can be documented in many patients by a uric acid-to-creatinine ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/mg)</span> above 1 on a random urine specimen; in comparison, the value is below 0.60 to 0.75 in most other forms of acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Release of other intracellular constituents also occurs when there is marked tissue breakdown (as in the tumor lysis syndrome), possibly leading to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Hyperphosphatemia may result in acute kidney injury, independent of uric acid precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Definition, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, etiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention is the best therapy for UAN, which usually occurs as part of the tumor lysis syndrome. Prevention in patients at high risk (eg, high-grade lymphoma and some leukemias) consists of aggressive intravenous hydration and recombinant urate oxidase (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a>, which converts urate to the much more water soluble end product, allantoin) or a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>), with rasburicase being preferred. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Definition, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, etiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If prevention is not possible, therapy after the onset of acute kidney injury consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a> and an attempt to &quot;wash out&quot; the obstructing uric acid crystals by increasing the urine output with intravenous fluids and a loop diuretic. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> should <strong>not</strong> be given at this time, particularly if the patient does not have a metabolic acidosis, since it has not been proven effective and may increase the risk of calcium phosphate precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Hemodialysis can remove the excess circulating urate in patients with persistent oliguria or anuria, and is useful in managing the volume status and other complications of acute kidney injury. The prognosis for complete recovery is excellent if treatment is initiated rapidly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC URATE NEPHROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic urate nephropathy is a form of chronic kidney disease induced by the deposition of sodium urate crystals in the medullary interstitium. This results in a chronic inflammatory response, similar to that seen with microtophus formation elsewhere in the body, potentially leading to interstitial fibrosis and chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although urate crystals in the renal medulla are demonstrable on biopsy, the clinical features of chronic urate nephropathy are nonspecific: renal functional impairment, bland urinary sediment, mild proteinuria, and serum urate concentrations often higher than expected for the degree of impaired renal function. Thus, it is difficult to separate this disorder from the multiple other causes of renal impairment that can occur in patients with hyperuricemia, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In the 1980s, many patients thought to have chronic urate nephropathy had lead nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, the applicability of this association to current practice in developed countries is uncertain in view of the reductions in population lead exposure (although excessive lead exposure does still occur in some regions). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lead nephropathy and lead-related nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Chronic urate nephropathy was primarily seen in the past in patients with tophaceous gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, it is currently thought to be uncommon and some feel that the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds in the absence of renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Others feel that chronic urate nephropathy can be considered in patients who have chronic kidney disease, the above nonspecific clinical features, and hyperuricemia out of proportion to the degree of renal insufficiency, which has been defined as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (535 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> if the serum creatinine concentration is &le;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (595 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> if the serum creatinine concentration is between 1.5 and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 to 176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (714 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with more advanced renal dysfunction</p><p/><p>There are at least two potential problems with these definitions of hyperuricemia out of proportion to the degree of renal insufficiency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum creatinine concentration may not be an accurate estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) since it is also determined by muscle mass. As an example, elderly or chronically ill patients may have a marked impairment in GFR with serum creatinine concentrations that are only modestly elevated. Estimation equations have been devised to account for this, but these equations have not been used to define serum urate concentrations higher than expected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20659769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Estimation equations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic kidney disease often have hypertension treated at least in part with diuretic therapy. The ensuing volume depletion can raise the serum urate concentration and, potentially, the serum creatinine concentration. Treatment of hypertension with angiotensin inhibition, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a>, may lower both the blood pressure and serum urate concentration. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia and gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The relatively modest hyperuricemia in chronic kidney disease <strong>not</strong> due to urate nephropathy may reflect mechanisms that partially compensate for the reduced efficiency of renal excretion, such as enhanced intestinal uric acid excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uric-acid-renal-diseases/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p>The potential role of modest hyperuricemia in the progression of chronic kidney disease is discussed in detail elsewhere.
