The etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in association with HIV infection is still the subject of intense speculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), patients are living longer, and the disease has become a chronic infection, even in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nevertheless, HIV infection confers a 61 percent increase in death compared with uninfected subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and a growing body of evidence implicates chronic inflammation that persists despite effective ART in the development of vascular dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With this, atherosclerotic vascular disease, especially coronary artery disease, has become the most important cardiovascular complication of HIV infection and has had the most attention directed to its pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In resource-limited settings where medical treatment is sparse, limited, or absent, HIV disease and its complications are similar to the disease in the pre&ndash;ART era.</p><p>This topic is devoted to the spectrum of cardiac and vascular diseases seen in HIV-infected patients. Discussions related specifically to coronary artery disease and its management in HIV-infected patients is discussed elsewhere.

However, certain cardiac disorders have been reported with greater frequency among HIV-infected patients compared with the general population; the specific type of cardiac disease varies by setting.</p><p>In resource-rich countries, with the widespread availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), patients are living longer, and other comorbidities have surfaced, such as hypertension, metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lipodystrophy), and accelerated atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-11</a>]. Thus, cardiovascular disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. As an example, in a study from the United States of death certificates that listed HIV infection, the proportion of deaths attributed to heart disease increased from 5 to 10 percent from 1996 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although cardiovascular disease is accounting for a larger percentage of all those who died, the number of patients dying from cardiovascular disease has actually decreased. In a study of almost 50,000 HIV-infected patients, all-cause deaths decreased by 48 percent from 17.5 deaths per 1000 person-years in 1999 to 2000 to 9.1 deaths per 1000 person-years in 2009 to 2011; cardiovascular deaths also decreased by 50 percent over this time period from 1.8 to 0.9 deaths per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The decrease in cardiovascular death could be explained by improved use of non-HIV-specific preventive measures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>HIV infection has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure in the ART era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, which followed 98,015 patients without baseline cardiovascular disease for a median of 7.1 years, HIV-infected veterans had an increased risk of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% CI 1.40-1.86) and heart failure with preserved (HFpEF; HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.72) compared with matched seronegative veterans. The risk of HFrEF was associated with high HIV viral loads (&gt; 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> and low CD4 cell counts (&lt; <span class=\"nowrap\">200/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> and it was pronounced in veterans younger than 40 years at baseline (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.95-6.58).</p><p>By contrast, pericardial effusion and myocardial disease, such as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, which were frequently reported among HIV-infected patients before the widespread use of ART, particularly in the setting of significant immunosuppression, are increasingly uncommon. However, in resource-limited settings, where many patients have limited access to ART, these syndromes remain the most common manifestations of HIV-associated cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In a study of 5328 patients presenting with a first diagnosis of heart disease to a large cardiology center in South Africa, 518 (10 percent) were HIV-infected, among whom cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 38 percent and pericarditis in 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Only 14 HIV-infected patients (2.7 percent) had a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.</p><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a relatively uncommon vascular complication associated with HIV infection. It can occur at all stages of infection, does not seem to be related to the degree of immunodeficiency, and carries a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with human immunodeficiency virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other cardiac and vascular processes that have been associated with HIV infection include venous thromboembolic disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), infective endocarditis (almost exclusively in injection drug users), cardiac rhythm disturbances, and very rarely, cardiac tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568654047\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In resource-rich settings, where there is widespread availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of death in HIV-infected patients relative to the decreasing incidence of opportunistic disease. Several lines of evidence, from modeling of calculated cardiovascular risk to clinical studies evaluating such hard endpoints as stroke, myocardial infarctions, and sudden cardiac death, have cumulatively supported this finding. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOCARDIAL DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347005872\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the prevalence of HIV-associated myocardial disease has dropped significantly in resource-rich areas since the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), subtle abnormalities in myocardial structure and function on echocardiography and imaging are still observed among treated HIV-infected individuals. Cardiomyopathy associated with HIV infection remains a major issue in resource-limited settings.</p><p>The spectrum of myocardial disease in patients with HIV infection ranges from incidental asymptomatic findings to symptomatic heart failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal myocarditis, usually seen incidentally at autopsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of abnormal myocardial structure or function on cardiovascular imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical cardiomyopathy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519455145\"><span class=\"h3\">Focal myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autopsy studies performed before the widespread availability and use of ART, myocarditis was detected among 9 to 52 percent of HIV-infected patients (average 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Nearly all had focal collections of mononuclear cells with or without evidence of myocardial necrosis, and ventricular dilatation was occasionally seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most of these patients had had no cardiovascular signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>There are minimal data on the prevalence of histopathological myocarditis among HIV-infected individuals in the ART era; however, advanced imaging studies suggest that subtle findings potentially reflective of prior myocarditis are still evident in HIV-infected patients on ART. In a study from the United Kingdom of 90 HIV-infected patients taking ART with a mean CD4 cell count of 546 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and without a known history of cardiac disease or associated symptoms, 76 percent had evidence by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patchy myocardial fibrosis, possibly suggestive of prior myocarditis, compared with 13 percent among 39 age- and ethnicity-matched HIV-uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Despite the increased frequency in myocardial fibrosis among HIV-infected patients overall, the actual volume of focal fibrosis in each individual remained low in both groups. The overall burden of left ventricular patchy fibrosis was small: 4 percent in the HIV-infected cohort and 2 percent in the control subjects. An endomyocardial biopsy study from South Africa conducted in the ART era found histologic evidence of myocarditis in 44 percent of 14 patients with HIV-associated cardiomyopathy compared with 25 percent of patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cardiotropic viral infection was present in 100 percent of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy and in 90 percent of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Patients with HIV-associated cardiomyopathy had a mean of 2.5 cardiotropic viruses identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784418106\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormalities on cardiovascular imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519455153\"><span class=\"h4\">Echocardiographic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several asymptomatic echocardiographic abnormalities have been reported among HIV-infected patients at various disease stages. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction appears to be the most common, although systolic dysfunction is also observed with moderate frequency, particularly among untreated HIV-infected patients.</p><p>Among HIV-patients in resource-rich settings who have access to ART, subclinical structural and functional cardiac abnormalities are found more frequently compared with the general population and appear to be associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>]. As an example, in a study of 196 HIV-infected adults in the United States, 97 (49 percent) had echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction compared with 15 (29 percent) of 52 age- and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among HIV-infected patients, the presence of diastolic dysfunction was not independently associated with CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level, or duration of ART after adjustment for age and hypertension. Only 4 percent of HIV-infected patients and no controls had systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;50 percent). In a meta-analysis of 11 studies from the ART era including over 2000 HIV-infected patients, the prevalence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction by echocardiography was 43.4 and 8.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Hypertension and old age were independently associated with diastolic dysfunction, and a history of myocardial infarction, an elevated C-reactive protein level, and current tobacco smoking were independently associated with systolic dysfunction.</p><p>By contrast, in resource-limited settings, echocardiographic abnormalities associated with HIV, in particular left ventricular systolic dysfunction, are generally associated with immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As an example, in a study from Rwanda that included 416 untreated HIV-infected patients without known cardiac disease, left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;45 percent) was found in 71 (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. On multivariate analysis, low socioeconomic status, longer duration of HIV infection, higher HIV viral load, more advanced HIV stage, and low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> plasma level were factors significantly associated with the presence of systolic dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614939281\"><span class=\"h4\">Magnetic resonance abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac MRI can also identify more subtle and subclinical myocardial abnormalities. Several studies have suggested that HIV-infected individuals have a higher rate of MRI findings suggestive of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31,32</a>]. As an example, a cross-sectional study of 90 HIV-infected individuals reported a 47 percent greater myocardial lipid content on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy compared with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, HIV-infected subjects had lower median high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher total <span class=\"nowrap\">cholesterol/high-density</span> lipoprotein ratio, and higher plasma triglycerides than HIV-uninfected subjects. HIV-infected individuals were also found to have impaired peak myocardial systolic and diastolic strain when compared with controls, despite the preserved global ejection fraction, consistent with studies of echocardiographic findings associated with HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H519455153\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiographic abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519455219\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically symptomatic cardiomyopathy is less common than histopathologic and cardiovascular imaging abnormalities, even in the era prior to the availability of potent ART, when it was reported in approximately 1 to 3 percent of patients with AIDS and the incidence of new cases was 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Nevertheless, it remains a significant manifestation of cardiac disease among HIV-infected individuals in resource-limited settings.</p><p>In a study from South Africa of patients presenting with newly diagnosed heart disease, among the 518 HIV-infected patients included, cardiomyopathy (left ventricular dysfunction or dilatation) was the most common primary diagnosis, made in 38 percent, and the majority (86 percent) of these patients reported some level of symptoms and functional limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, among the total cohort of 5328 patients, cardiomyopathy was only documented in 3.7 percent.</p><p>The clinical presentation of cardiomyopathy is similar in HIV-infected patients as in those who are not infected. The initial symptoms are nonspecific: as an example, dyspnea may be due to pulmonary involvement or cardiac disease. More specific signs of cardiac involvement are an S3 gallop or pulmonary edema or a pathologic murmur. The clinical presentation of heart failure is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Some patients with asymptomatic or overt left ventricular dysfunction have a known or clear etiology such as coronary artery disease, cocaine use, alcoholic heart disease, drug toxicity, or myocarditis due to an opportunistic infection such as toxoplasmosis or cryptococcosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,2,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,37</a>]. However, in a number of cases, the etiology and pathogenesis is unknown or unidentified.</p><p>The etiology of heart failure and myocarditis in general is discussed elsewhere.

Although in-hospital and one-year mortality rates were similar in both groups, HIV-infected patients were more likely to be rehospitalized for heart failure during that year than the controls (3.3 versus 1.4 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568654087\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although an alternative causative pathogen can be identified in some cases of myocarditis in HIV-infected patients, the etiology of 80 to 85 percent of cases remain uncertain. Direct invasion by HIV itself may be responsible, but other cardiotropic viruses that are not directly identified, such as cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, or Epstein-Barr virus, also may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37</a>].

Since the myocardial cell lacks CD4 receptors, HIV is denied the usual mode of entrance into the cell. However, the organism could enter the cell if the cell was injured by another virus. In in vitro studies, for example, Epstein-Barr virus permitted the entrance and replication of HIV into CD4 receptor-negative myocardial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, HIV has been localized in or near the myocardial cell by immunocytochemical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>] and in situ DNA hybridization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,48,49</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial and myocardial disease had historically been the most frequent clinical manifestations of heart disease in HIV-infected patients, but their prevalence has decreased dramatically with the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Nevertheless, they remain common in resource-limited settings where access to diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection is limited. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of cardiac disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the prevalence of HIV-associated myocardial disease has dropped significantly since the widespread use of ART, subtle abnormalities in myocardial structure and function on echocardiography and imaging are still observed among treated HIV-infected individuals. Nevertheless, routine echocardiography in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients is not indicated, as there appears to be no advantage to finding subclinical disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac ischemia may emerge as an important cause of clinical cardiomyopathy in treated HIV-infected patients. The clinical presentation, diagnosis and evaluation, and management of heart failure in HIV-infected patients are generally the same as in the general population. However, the potential involvement of opportunistic infections should be considered among HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-the-etiology-and-severity-of-heart-failure-or-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial disease among HIV-infected patients generally manifests as a pericardial effusion in patients with significant immunosuppression, often found incidentally. The majority of symptomatic pericardial effusions are due to infection (particularly tuberculosis) or malignancy. The diagnosis and evaluation of a pericardial effusion in an HIV-infected individual are the same as those in the general population. The management of pericardial effusion in HIV-infected patients varies by the severity and etiology of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H519454363\" class=\"local\">'Pericardial disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a relatively uncommon complication of HIV infection that can occur at all stages of infection, does not seem to be related to the degree of immunodeficiency, and carries a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with human immunodeficiency virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cardiac and vascular processes that have been associated with HIV infection include venous thromboembolic disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), infective endocarditis (almost exclusively in injection drug users), cardiac rhythm disturbances, and, very rarely, cardiac tumors.
