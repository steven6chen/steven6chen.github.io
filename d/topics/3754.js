At diagnosis, approximately 50 percent have disease that extends beyond locoregional confines, and only one-half of those who appear to have locoregional tumor involvement can undergo a potentially curative resection. Surgically curable early gastric cancers are usually asymptomatic and only infrequently detected outside the realm of a screening program. Screening is not widely performed, except in countries which have a very high incidence, such as Japan, Venezuela, and Chile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-cancer-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric cancer screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The common presenting symptoms and diagnostic approaches to gastric cancer will be reviewed here. Epidemiology, issues related to screening for high-risk patients, and the treatment of gastric cancer are discussed separately.

They may also present with a gastric outlet obstruction from an advanced distal tumor.</p><p>Occult gastrointestinal bleeding with or without iron deficiency anemia is not uncommon, while overt bleeding (ie, melena or hematemesis) is seen in less than 20 percent of cases. The presence of a palpable abdominal mass is the most common physical finding and generally indicates long-standing, advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A pseudoachalasia syndrome may occur as the result of involvement of Auerbach's plexus due to local extension or to malignant obstruction near the gastroesophageal junction. For this reason, gastric cancer needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis for older patients presenting with achalasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Approximately 25 percent of patients have a history of gastric ulcer. All gastric ulcers should be followed to complete healing, and those that do not heal should undergo resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Need for follow-up endoscopy for gastric ulcers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs of tumor extension or spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms described above are those most commonly seen at initial presentation of gastric cancer. More unusual presentations, related to the propensity of gastric cancer to spread by direct extension through the gastric wall, can also alert the clinician to the diagnosis. As an example, feculent emesis or passage of recently ingested material in the stool can be seen with malignant gastrocolic fistula, although this is quite rare. More commonly, colonic obstruction may occur.</p><p>Patients may also present with signs or symptoms of distant metastatic disease. The most common metastatic distribution is to the liver, peritoneal surfaces, and nonregional or distant lymph nodes. Less commonly, ovaries, central nervous system, bone, pulmonary or soft tissue metastases occur.</p><p>Since gastric cancer can spread via lymphatics, the physical examination may reveal a left supraclavicular adenopathy (a Virchow's node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) which is the most common physical examination finding of metastatic disease, a periumbilical nodule (Sister Mary Joseph's node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]), or a left axillary node (Irish node).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal spread can present with an enlarged ovary (Krukenberg's tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]) or a mass in the cul-de-sac on rectal examination (Blumer's shelf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]). However, there are patients with ovarian metastasis without other peritoneal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites can also be the first indication of peritoneal carcinomatosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palpable liver mass can indicate metastases, although metastatic disease to the liver is often multifocal or diffuse. Liver involvement is often, but not always, associated with an elevation in the serum alkaline phosphatase concentration. Jaundice or clinical evidence of liver failure is seen in the preterminal stages of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic manifestations of gastric cancer related to paraneoplastic phenomena are rarely seen at initial presentation. Dermatologic findings may include the sudden appearance of diffuse seborrheic keratoses (sign of Leser-Tr&eacute;lat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which is characterized by velvety and darkly pigmented patches on skin folds. Neither finding is specific for gastric cancer.</p><p>Other paraneoplastic abnormalities that can occur in gastric cancer include a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and hypercoagulable states (Trousseau's syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Polyarteritis nodosa has been reported as the single manifestation of an early and surgically curable gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though a delay in diagnosis has not been associated with a poorer prognosis, a prompt diagnostic evaluation should be commenced when gastric cancer is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue diagnosis and anatomic localization of the primary tumor are best obtained by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58136%7EGAST%2F71672\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58136 graphicRef71672 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Although more invasive and more costly, upper endoscopy is also more sensitive and specific for diagnosing a variety of gastric, esophageal and duodenal lesions than alternative diagnostic strategies (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies, see below). The early use of upper endoscopy in patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints may be associated with a higher rate of detection of early gastric cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Early diagnosis of gastric cancer'</a>.)</p><p>The ability to perform biopsy during endoscopy adds to its clinical utility. Since up to 5 percent of malignant ulcers appear benign grossly, it is imperative that all such lesions be evaluated by biopsy and histologic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During endoscopy, any suspicious-appearing gastric ulceration should be biopsied. A single biopsy has a 70 percent sensitivity for diagnosing an existing gastric cancer, while performing seven biopsies from the ulcer margin and base increases the sensitivity to greater than 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. While it is clear that any suspicious-appearing lesion requires biopsy, it may be even more important to take numerous biopsies from smaller, benign-appearing gastric ulcers, since the diagnosis of early gastric cancer offers the greatest opportunity for surgical cure and long-term survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of a particularly aggressive form of diffuse-type gastric cancer, so called &quot;linitis plastica&quot;, can be difficult endoscopically. Because these tumors tend to infiltrate the submucosa and muscularis propria, superficial mucosal biopsies may be falsely negative. For this reason, the combination of strip and bite biopsy techniques should be used when there is a suspicion of a diffuse type of gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Poor distensibility of the stomach or the classic appearance on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow (described as a leather-flask appearance) may suggest the presence of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Barium studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Brush cytology increases the sensitivity of single biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but the extent to which it enhances diagnostic yield when seven biopsies are obtained remains unknown. If bleeding with biopsy is of concern to the endoscopist, it is reasonable to brush the ulcer base, since the risk of bleeding from this technique is negligible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Need for follow-up endoscopy for gastric ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for a follow-up endoscopy in patients with an established gastric ulcer is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1279661632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Upper endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Barium studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> studies can identify both malignant gastric ulcers and infiltrating lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62708%7EGAST%2F64355%7EGAST%2F62794%7EGAST%2F51673%7EGAST%2F51893%7EGAST%2F63601\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62708 graphicRef64355 graphicRef62794 graphicRef51673 graphicRef51893 graphicRef63601 \">image 1A-F</a>), and some early gastric cancers also may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61767\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61767 \">image 2</a>). However, false-negative barium studies can occur in as many as 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is a particular problem in early gastric cancer where the sensitivity of barium meals may be as low as 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, in most settings, upper endoscopy is the preferred initial diagnostic test for patients in whom gastric cancer is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The one scenario in which a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> study may be superior to upper endoscopy is in patients with linitis plastica. The decreased distensibility of the stiff, &quot;leather-flask&quot; appearing stomach is more obvious on the radiographic study, and the endoscopic appearance may be relatively normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79963\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79963 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major classification systems currently in use for gastric cancer. The most elaborate, the Japanese classification, is based upon refined anatomic location, particularly of the lymph node stations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The other and more widely used staging system, developed jointly by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), is the classification most often used in the Western hemisphere and now commonly in Asian countries as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">TNM staging criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging schema of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> is based upon tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classifications.</p><p>The most recent revision of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> TNM staging classification (eighth edition, 2017) includes separate prognostic stage groups for clinical and pathologic staging, including pathologic staging after neoadjuvant therapy (yp stage) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Tumors involving the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal rather than gastric cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 3</a>). In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers.

Distal splenic artery involvement is not an indicator of unresectability; the vessel can be resected en bloc with a left upper quadrant exenteration: stomach, spleen and distal pancreas.

Linitis plastica has an extremely poor prognosis, and many surgeons consider the presence of linitis plastica to be a contraindication to potentially curative resection.

CT is widely available and noninvasive. It is best suited to evaluating widely metastatic disease, especially hepatic or adnexal metastases, ascites, or distant nodal spread. Patients who have CT-defined visceral metastatic disease can avoid unnecessary surgery, although biopsy confirmation is recommended because of the risk of false-positive findings.</p><p>Peritoneal metastases and hematogenous metastases smaller than 5 mm are frequently missed by CT, even using modern CT techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In 20 to 30 percent of patients with a negative CT, intraperitoneal disease will be found at either staging laparoscopy or at open exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>Another limitation of CT is its inability to accurately assess the depth of primary tumor invasion (particularly with small tumors) and the presence of lymph node involvement. CT accurately assesses the T stage of the primary tumor in only about 50 to 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>]. The tumor is more often understaged because the depth of invasion is underestimated; however, overstaging also occurs.</p><p>The classification of nodal status is usually based on lymph node size, and sensitivity of CT for detecting regional nodal metastases is limited for involved nodes that are smaller than 0.8 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>]. Furthermore, false-positive findings may be attributed to inflammatory lymphadenopathy. In series of patients undergoing staging CT for gastric cancer or gastric and esophageal cancer, sensitivity and specificity rates for regional nodal metastases range from 65 to 97, and 49 to 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is thought to be the most reliable nonsurgical method available for evaluating the depth of invasion of primary gastric cancers, particularly for early (T1) lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a systematic review of studies comparing EUS staging versus histopathology as the reference standard, the summary sensitivity and specificity rates for distinguishing T1 from T2 cancers with EUS were 85 and 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> tumors were 86 and 90 percent, respectively. For metastatic involvement of lymph nodes, the summary sensitivity and specificity rates were 83 and 67 percent, respectively. There was significant between-study heterogeneity that could not be easily explained. However, as with any technical endeavor, there is a degree of variability in operator expertise, which could at least partially explain these findings. Furthermore, the analysis of positive and negative likelihood ratios revealed that EUS diagnostic performance was favorable neither for exclusion or confirmation of nodal positivity. Thus, EUS cannot be considered optimal for distinguishing positive versus negative lymph node status.</p><p>In comparative studies of preoperative staging, EUS generally provides a more accurate prediction of T stage than does CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>], although newer CT techniques (such as three-dimensional multidetector row CT) and MRI may achieve similar results in terms of diagnostic accuracy in T staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/37,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,44,45</a>].

One of the most important changes compared with the earlier 2010 classification is a redefinition of the boundary between esophageal and gastric cancers. Tumors involving the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers, while EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ.
