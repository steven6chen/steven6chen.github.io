Another name for this procedure is &quot;pregnancy termination.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513508\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do women have abortions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many reasons why a woman might have an abortion. She might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not be able to afford a baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have room in her life for a baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be single and not want to raise a baby alone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with her husband or partner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find out that something is wrong with her unborn baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have health problems that make pregnancy a problem</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513515\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide if an abortion is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a very personal decision. If you don't know what to do, talk to someone you trust. Your doctor, nurse, or clinic can help. It might also help to talk to your partner, family members, or friends. If you are younger than 18, you might need permission from an adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513522\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an abortion done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 main ways to do an abortion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medication abortion</strong> &ndash; You take pills to end the pregnancy. This only works until 10 weeks into a pregnancy (that means 10 weeks after your last period). It is also sometimes called &quot;medical abortion.&quot; Women who have a medication abortion need to take 2 separate medicines. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical abortion</strong> &ndash; A doctor uses surgical tools to end the pregnancy. This can be done in the first or second trimester. The procedure takes 15 to 30 minutes, but most women spend a few hours at the clinic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513529\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a medication abortion done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the clinic or doctor's office, you will take a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mifepristone</a> (brand name: Mifeprex). A few hours or days later, you will take another medicine. This one is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">misoprostol</a> (brand name: Cytotec). You can take the second medicine at home. The medicines cause your body to end the pregnancy. It might take 4 to 6 hours after taking the second medicine for this to happen. When it does, you will bleed from your vagina. You might also see blood clots or pieces of tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513536\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have symptoms after a medication abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and cramps in the lower belly after you take the second medicine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">misoprostol</a>). These last for up to 6 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the vagina. Bleeding can be very heavy for a few hours after you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">misoprostol</a>. Light bleeding might go on for a few weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513543\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a surgical abortion done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, you will get a shot of anesthesia, so you will not feel pain. Some kinds of anesthesia allow you to stay awake. Some put you to sleep. After the anesthesia starts working, the doctor will use special tools to remove the pregnancy tissue from your uterus. This is done through your vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>), so there will be no cuts or scars. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513550\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have symptoms after a surgical abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is common to have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and cramping in the lower belly. This lasts for a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the vagina. This is usually lighter than after a medication abortion. The bleeding can last for up to 2 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513557\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have an abortion if I am 14 or more weeks pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women can have an abortion until the legal limit in their area. The legal limit in many places is about 20 to 24 weeks or until a baby could live outside the womb. Abortions after 14 weeks sometimes involve a longer procedure. But they still involve medicines or surgery, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513564\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse after an abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your bleeding is heavy enough to soak through one menstrual pad each hour, for at least 2 hours, and you are still bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain is really bad (it makes you double over or makes it hard to move), and you don't feel better with pain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Motrin, Advil)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad-smelling discharge comes out of your vagina</p><p/><p>In some cases, abortions do not work completely. In other words, they do not always get rid of all the pregnancy tissue. If that happens to you, you will need to have a procedure to remove any leftover tissue. Signs that an abortion was not complete include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not bleeding after a medication abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Still feeling symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and tender breasts, 1 week or more after your abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding for more than 2 weeks after an abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having a period in the first 6 weeks after an abortion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513571\"><span class=\"h1\">Is it risky to have an abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, abortions are very safe. But like any medical procedure, abortions do have some small risks. If you have an abortion, make sure it is done by a doctor or specially trained nurse in a clinic or hospital. Do not take any medicines, or put anything in your vagina, without talking to a doctor or nurse first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513578\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I should do differently after an abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Do not have sex or put anything into your vagina for 2 weeks after an abortion. If you do, you could get a very serious infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513585\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again someday?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having an abortion does not make it harder to get pregnant again. Abortions do not harm your health, and they do not harm the health of your future babies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729513592\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abortion-pregnancy-termination-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abortion (pregnancy termination) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
