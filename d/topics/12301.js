Five-year overall survival in patients with stage I or stage II disease is typically 70 to 90 percent. The prognosis for patients who present with more advanced (stage III or IV) disease is poorer. As an example, patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal carcinoma have an approximately 40 percent overall survival rate at five years. However, in patients with tobacco- and alcohol-related cancers, a 20 percent rate of second malignancy might be expected over five years.</p><p>For patients with an oropharyngeal HNSCC, prognosis is also associated with whether or not the cancer is related to human papillomavirus (HPV). For patients with locoregionally advanced oropharyngeal cancer, HPV is associated with long-term survival rates of approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. The overall improvement in survival for oropharyngeal cancer may be due to this epidemiologic shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14542126\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FOR FOLLOW-UP, SURVEILLANCE, AND SECONDARY PREVENTION IN THE LONG-TERM SURVIVOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the intensity of follow-up is greatest in the first two to four years following diagnosis, since approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences occur within this timeframe. However, patients should continue to be followed beyond five years because of the risk of late complications, as well as the risk of late recurrence or second malignancies. This may be especially important for patients with non-human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancers.

Other than post-treatment baseline imaging of the primary and the neck if treated, there is no role of routine serial imaging in long-term survivors of head and neck cancer unless otherwise indicated by new signs or symptoms. However, patients with over 20 or more pack-years of smoking history would be candidates for annual low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) scan of the lung. Surveillance for recurrences is based on detailed clinical examination and fiberoptic visualization by the multidisciplinary treatment team.

As a result, there are little data to inform the issues experienced in long-term HNSCC survivors who are without evidence of disease for five years or more. However, they are at an increased mortality due to cancer and other causes, which persists for up to 10 years after diagnosis. As an example, one study evaluated almost 36,000 HNSCC survivors followed for a median of 7.7 years after initial diagnosis (range, 3 to 17.9 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Worsening of dental health after treatment is common and could lead to significant compromise in quality of life of the long-term head and neck cancer survivors. Deterioration of dental and oral health is thought to be secondary to xerostomia, change in salivary pH to acidic, demineralization, and decreased vascularity associated with radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28</a>]. Gradual dental decline, xerostomia and difficulties with ill-fitting dentures, coupled with the financial limitations including the lack of proper dental insurance coverage, can add to the burden of long-term survivors. In addition, inadequate dental rehabilitation results in a compromised ability to eat and has been directly linked to poor quality of life due to compromised eating and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Although data on the late effects of mucositis are limited, the patient&rsquo;s dental status at one year post-treatment appears to be a strong predictor of quality of life of survivors five years from completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-approach-to-long-term-survivors-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

More commonly seen after oral cavity, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal cancer therapy, trismus is caused by inflammation and fibrosis of the pterygoid and masseter muscles.

(See <a href=\"#H608998309\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The steady increase in the rate of head and neck cancer survivors is likely due to advances in treatment, decrease in smoking rates, and the improved prognosis associated with the now recognized and improved prognosis from oropharyngeal carcinomas associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Today there are more than half a million survivors who have been rendered cured of head and neck cancer in the United States alone. (See <a href=\"#H590111951\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is based on whether the disease is early or advanced-stage at presentation and the primary site of the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H608998315\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with early (stage I and II) HNSCC are generally managed with single-modality treatment, consisting of either surgery or radiation therapy (RT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with advanced (stage III, IVA, and IVB) cancers are typically managed with multimodality treatment with organ preservation, an important objective of therapy. Such patients should receive care from a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise in the treatment of HNSCC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of HNSCC depends on stage at presentation and the site of involvement. Five-year overall survival in patients with stage I or II disease is typically 70 to 90 percent. The prognosis for patients who present with more advanced (stage III or IV) disease is poorer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the intensity of follow-up is greatest in the first two to four years following diagnosis, since approximately 80 to 90 percent of all recurrences occur within this timeframe. However, patients should continue to be followed beyond five years because of the risk of late complications, as well as the risk of late recurrence or second malignancies. This may be especially important for patients with non-human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancers.

Worsening of dental health after treatment is common and is mostly as a result of dry mouth or &quot;xerostomia&quot; from head and neck radiation. Poor oral hygiene and dental health decline could lead to significant compromise in quality of life of the long-term head and neck cancer survivors. Among common complications in these patients are mucosal sensitivity, malocclusion of teeth or dental prosthesis (dentures), osteoradionecrosis, and trismus.

In addition, neck stiffness is a common complaint that is encountered in clinic. (See <a href=\"#H14541923\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivors of HNSCC are at risk for psychosocial issues related to body image, speech unintelligibility, food-related lifestyle limitations, and sexual health. In addition, they are at high risk for mood disorders, including depression and anxiety. Fear of recurrence and fear regarding secondary cancers add to the burden of survivorship. Clinicians should be aware of these issues and screen for them in follow-up to ensure that these patients get the support and counseling necessary.
