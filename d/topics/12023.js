Occupational asthma is a disease characterized by variable airflow limitation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and inflammation resulting from an inciting agent only found in the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis and pathology of occupational asthma will be reviewed here. Issues related to other aspects of occupational asthma are discussed separately.

This type includes reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) caused by a single high level exposure to an irritant, irritant-induced asthma caused by multiple high level exposures to an irritant, and possibly asthma caused by chronic lower level of exposure, although the latter is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Some occupational agents, such as diisocyanates, may induce asthma through more than one mechanism. As an example, asthma may develop in subjects after a diisocyanate spill by causing acute airway injury and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), while in others, respiratory sensitization to diisocyanate develops with lower levels of exposure. Exposure to high levels of diisocyanates causing irritant-induced occupational asthma can also promote the development of immunologic occupational asthma caused by diisocyanates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of immunologically mediated occupational asthma, the pathology in the airways at the time of exposure is similar to that seen in patients with nonoccupational asthma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-asthma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of asthma&quot;, section on 'Airway inflammation'</a>). Nonimmunologic irritant mediated occupational asthma is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathologic abnormalities associated with occupational asthma persist for weeks to years after cessation of exposure. One study examined the bronchial biopsies of 18 subjects with occupational asthma after cessation of exposure for a period of 3 to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Eleven subjects had disease due to exposure to high molecular weight compounds, and seven to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds. Extensive epithelial desquamation, epithelial cell ciliary abnormalities, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and subepithelial fibrosis were found, and the numbers of total inflammatory cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were increased compared to healthy controls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60266\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60266 \">picture 1</a>). Similar findings were described in reports of subjects with isocyanate- and Western red cedar-related asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Animal models have suggested that profibrotic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-13, can be involved in these changes although a direct toxicity of some agents against epithelial cells can be involved in the remodelling process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Subjects with isocyanate-induced asthma show a reduction in subepithelial fibrosis, but persistence of inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways after removal from exposure for a period ranging from 5 to 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The course of airway hyperresponsiveness parallels that of airway inflammation, suggesting that airway inflammation contributes to the persistence of hyperresponsiveness. It is possible that inflammatory and remodeling airway changes precede the development of clinical features of occupational asthma, as shown in asthma induced by common allergens, but this remains to be further documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Persistent airway inflammation and remodeling exists even in subjects whose occupational asthma is presumed to be cured. In an observational study, 133 subjects with occupational asthma were evaluated at a mean of nine years after cessation of the exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among those from whom induced sputum was obtained (n = 84), eosinophils were increased (&ge;2 percent) in 18 percent, including 3 of the 20 subjects who were considered cured, based on resolution of symptoms, no need for respiratory medication, normal airway caliber, and nonallergic airway responsiveness. Neutrophils were increased (&ge;61 percent of cells in induced sputum) in 45 percent (including nine of those considered cured). Furthermore, 10 of the subjects considered cured, who had no evidence of bronchial eosinophilia on induced sputum, underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies at a mean of 14 years after cessation of exposure. Compared to controls, subjects with prior occupational asthma had more transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) positive cells, increased subepithelial fibrosis, and decreased distance between the epithelium and airway smooth muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These findings suggest that permanent inflammatory and structural changes persist many years after stopping exposure to an antigenic material. The reason for the persistence of eosinophilic inflammatory changes many years after stopping exposure is unknown.</p><p>Acute changes in the airways of subjects with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) or irritant-induced asthma consist of rapid denudation of the mucosa with fibrinohemorrhagic exudate and swelling in the submucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53602\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53602 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is followed by regeneration of the epithelium with proliferation of basal and parabasal cells and persistent subepithelial edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similar findings have been described in an animal model of RADS due to chlorine exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Furthermore, bronchial biopsies from subjects with persistent asthma symptoms two years following chlorine-induced RADS show a thickened basement membrane with reticulocollagenic fibrosis of the bronchial wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62311\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62311 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In irritant-induced asthma due to multiple exposures to an irritant, an inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils and lymphocytes is found, as well as diffuse deposition with collagen fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Even many years after the inhalational accident, induced sputum can show increased levels of mediators involved in inflammation and airway remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome and irritant-induced asthma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Evidence of eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation and also airway remodeling can persist for several years following acute irritant-induced asthma. Ten subjects with irritant-induced asthma (mean interval of 10.9 years, minimum of 4 years, since the inhalational accident) underwent bronchoscopy followed by bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most significant difference in tissue morphometry was the increase in basement membrane thickness in subjects with irritant-induced asthma compared with the healthy controls and subjects with mild asthma. The detachment of epithelium was increased in subjects with irritant-induced asthma, although not significantly so. Also, the number of TGF-beta1 positive cells and ECP positive cells was increased by comparison with normal controls and comparable to subjects with common asthma. Finally, the levels of cells (neutrophils and eosinophils) and of several mediators that reflect an inflammatory and remodeling effect were significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage than in normal controls and comparable or even higher than in subjects with common asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic loci associated with non-occupational asthma have been investigated as susceptibility markers for occupational asthma, primarily in workers with diisocyanate asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innate immunity and immunoregulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Th2-cell differentiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial biology and mucosal immunity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function (airway hyperresponsiveness), airway remodeling, and disease severity</p><p/><p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, which is synonymous with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), encodes a variety of cell surface markers, antigen-presenting molecules, and other proteins involved in immune function. Studies of genes involved in immunoregulation have shown associations between HLA Class II antigens and various types of occupational asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Several examples of HLA associates (eg, DR3, DQ5, DQA1, DQB1, DR1) have been described in the case of workers exposed to diisocyanates, Western red cedar, platinum salts, laboratory animals, and anhydrides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study of 140 diisocyanate-exposed workers, diisocyanate asthma was associated with HLA Class I (HLA-B and HLA-E) and Class II single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), not identified in prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The associations with HLA antigens have biological implications in that they provide evidence for a specific immunological response and for T cell involvement in the development of occupational asthma caused by low molecular weight compounds.</p><p>Several studies support a role for antioxidant genes, such as the glutathione S-transferases (eg, GSTP1 and GSTM1) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT1, NAT2), in the development of occupational asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glutathione S-transferases belong to a family of enzymes that detoxify chemical substances in the body. The GSTM1 null genotype is associated with an approximately two fold increased risk of diisocyanate-induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, GSTM1 null and GSTM3 AA genotypes are significantly related to late asthmatic reactions induced by diisocyanates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. On the other hand, homozygosity for the GSTP1*Val allele may provide a protective effect against asthma in workers exposed to isocyanate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NAT1 also helps to metabolize drugs and chemicals. The slow acetylator genotype increases the risk of asthma in workers exposed to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. NAT2 SNPs and SNP combinations have been associated with a higher likelihood of diisocyanate asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic variants in manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) and their interactions may contribute to development of diisocyanate asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p>Associations have also been found for other genes (eg, toll-like receptors, IL-4 receptor, IL-13, CD14, neurokinin 2 receptor, alpha-catenin) in patients with occupational asthma due to diisocyanates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. An association between diisocyanate asthma and two linked alpha-catenin gene variants was identified by GWAS and confirmed in a second worker population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In addition, genetic variations in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) 1, and PTGS2 are associated with diisocyanate asthma susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Work-related exposure to occupational chemicals could result in epigenetic modification of specific genes associated with airway inflammation. The interferon (IFN)-gamma gene promoter region was significantly hyper-methylated in a study of workers with diisocyanate asthma in comparison to asymptomatic workers, suggesting that epigenetic effects could play an important mechanistic role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Gene-environment interactions are difficult to study in the workplace. A cross-sectional study performed in laboratory animal workers demonstrated that those workers with high endotoxin exposure and a known CD14 endotoxin responsive genotype had significantly lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), suggesting that workers with the latter genotype are at greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOLOGIC MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents that induce occupational asthma by immunologic mechanisms are characterized by a latency period between exposure and the development of symptoms. Immunologic occupational asthma affects only a small proportion of exposed subjects, but in these patients exposure to a minute quantity of the offending agent can lead to a severe asthmatic reaction. While some compounds, mostly metal salts and those containing protein, induce asthma through the production of specific IgE antibodies, the immunologic mechanism(s) that pertain to other agents (most chemicals) have not been identified.</p><p>Specific IgE-mediated responses to work-place sensitizers are considered to be involved in the majority of cases of occupational asthma, particularly when caused by high-molecular-weight agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Low molecular weight agents are, however, more likely to cause non-IgE-mediated disease. In this regard, bronchial biopsies obtained after inhalation challenge with diisocyanates did not reveal an expression of messenger RNA for IgE &epsilon; (epsilon) chains or interleukin (IL)-4, suggesting that IgE is not usually involved in this type of OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>T lymphocytes appear to play a major role in the pathophysiology of occupational asthma. When causative agents are inhaled, antigen-presenting cells collect and process the antigen, and then migrate to regional lymph nodes where the antigen is presented to T helper cells, which are responsible for the initiation of the immune response. In a series of nonsmoking patients with occupational asthma, a triple-color immunohistofluorescence labelling technique was used on cryosections of bronchial samples to demonstrate a significantly increased bronchial density of regulatory T cells, effector T cells, proliferative T cells, and activated CD8+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, skin exposure has also been incriminated in the onset of sensitization to diisocyanates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE-mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High molecular weight (HMW) agents (eg, latex, animal proteins, and flour) act as complete antigens and induce the production of specific IgE antibodies. Certain low molecular weight (LMW) occupational agents, including platinum salts, trimellitic anhydride, and other acid anhydrides, can also induce specific IgE antibodies, probably by acting as haptens and binding with proteins to form functional antigens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66185 \">table 1</a>). These agents mostly affect atopic subjects. Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations have been described, but the results have not been convincingly reproduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the characteristics of the inciting antigen, reactions between specific IgE antibodies and antigens lead to a cascade of events that results in an influx of inflammatory cells into the airway and the release of inflammatory mediators.</p><p>Inhalational challenge with culprit antigens in sensitized individuals generally results in an isolated early reaction, although inhalation challenge may sometimes result in a late reaction or a biphasic reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56482\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56482 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An isolated early asthmatic reaction occurs within a few minutes after an inhalation challenge, reaches it maximum within one-half hour, and subsides within 1 to 1.5 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A late reaction occurs four to six hours after a challenge, reaches maximal intensity within eight to ten hours, and subsides after 24 to 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biphasic reaction is a combination of an early and a late reaction.</p><p/><p>Specific inhalation challenges can also cause atypical temporal patterns of airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although occupational asthma due to high-molecular-weight agents is frequently if not always associated with increased levels of specific IgE antibodies, this test alone should not be considered as confirming the disease. Confirming the effect of exposure to the agent on airway function should always be recommended for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection of IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to detect specific IgE antibodies in patients with occupational asthma to low molecular weight agents may be technically difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Specific IgE antibodies to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) have been reported in 0 to 50 percent of workers with TDI induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This variation has been attributed to several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The short half-life of the specific IgE antibodies to TDI of about two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appearance of new antigenic determinants after the binding of specific IgE to TDI-human albumin conjugate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of different carrier proteins.

However, many LMW agents are NOT associated with production of specific IgE.

As examples, certain transitional metals form coordination complexes that may chelate human proteins (eg, chromium, cobalt, nickel, platinum), and some organic substances have two or more reactive chemical groups (eg, amines, cyanates) that are highly reactive with human macromolecules. The agents with two or more reactive chemical groups, also known as bifunctional bases, (eg, diisocyanate) have a much higher propensity to induce asthma than those with a single reactive group, also known as a monofunctional base (eg, monoisocyanates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence against IgE mediation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence against IgE mediation in occupational asthma induced by LMW agents includes the following observations: affected workers are typically nonatopic, the pattern of airflow limitation following inhalational challenge is different from that of IgE-mediated occupational asthma, and the IgE molecules identified lack the ability to cause passive sensitization.</p><p>Specific inhalation challenge tests with LMW agents generally induce an isolated late asthmatic reaction or a biphasic reaction, rather than the predominantly early reaction of IgE-mediated occupational asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Atypical reactions are often observed with LMW agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65163 \">figure 2</a>): a progressive type with onset during or minutes after exposure, progressing to a maximum reaction five to six hours later, a continuous asthmatic reaction with no remission between the early and the late phases (square-waved), and a prolonged immediate reaction.

As an example, Western red cedar-related asthma, caused by sensitization to the LMW agent plicatic acid, results in production of IgE antibodies to plicatic acid in approximately 20 percent of affected subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, these antibodies do not passively sensitize human lung fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Based on the high proportion of patients without evidence of specific IgE production and the lack of passive sensitization, it is likely that non-IgE mechanisms are responsible for the majority of plicatic acid-induced occupational asthma.</p><p>In contrast, among workers with suspected diisocyanate-induced asthma, having a higher level of specific IgE to diisocyanates is highly specific for being affected with occupational asthma as confirmed by specific inhalation challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence for cell mediated responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies have found that cellular mediated immunological mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of non-IgE mediated immunologic (low molecular weight antigen) occupational asthma.

Among workers exposed to diisocyanate, production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to stimulation with diisocyanate-human serum albumin (DIISO-HSA) was more sensitive and specific for diisocyanate-induced asthma than serum levels of specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy 24 hours after diisocyanate inhalational challenge, bronchial recruitment of IL-5, CD25 (soluble IL-2 receptor), and CD4 positive cells was noted in patients with diisocyanate-induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to most studies that suggest mediation by CD4 T cells, one study of bronchial biopsies from patients with diisocyanate-induced asthma found that the majority of T cells exhibited the CD8 phenotype and produced IFN-gamma and IL-5, with very few clones producing IL-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Acute airway injury from accidental exposure to high dose of irritants such as chlorine, ammonia, smoke, or acetic acid may lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS).

Epithelial damage may also result in the marked airway remodeling observed in these patients, particularly the intense subepithelial fibrosis which is probably responsible for the reduced reversibility of airflow obstruction observed in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-asthma-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some low molecular weight agents have pharmacologic properties that may cause bronchoconstriction.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two main types of occupational asthma have been recognized: immunologically mediated (with or without evidence of participation of IgE), and nonimmunologic, irritant mediated. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of immunologically mediated occupational asthma, the pathology in the airways is similar to that seen in patients with nonoccupational asthma. The pathologic changes may persist for weeks to years after cessation of exposure. For nonimmunological occupational asthma, there is a predominance of denudation of epithelium in the acute phase with a long-term increase in basement membrane thickness. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High molecular weight agents (eg, animal proteins and flour) act as complete antigens and induce the production of specific IgE antibodies, which are felt to play a key role in disease pathogenesis, similar to that of common inhalant allergens (eg, dust mite) in allergic asthma. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain low molecular weight occupational agents, including platinum salts, trimellitic anhydride, and other acid anhydrides, also induce specific IgE antibodies, probably by acting as haptens, binding with proteins to form functional antigens. Most low molecular weight agents may also cause occupational asthma through non-IgE mediated mechanisms.

Nonimmunologic occupational asthma is characterized by the absence of a latency period and by exposure to a high level of the irritant agent.
