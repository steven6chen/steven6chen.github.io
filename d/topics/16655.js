The lowest operative mortality rates and best long-term cancer outcomes have been demonstrated at high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In experienced hands, the median operative time for the Whipple procedure is 5.5 hours, with a median blood loss of 350 mL and mortality of less than 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Resection of the head of the pancreas is indicated primarily for neoplasms, and necessitates concomitant duodenal resection.

Most pancreatic resections are performed under elective circumstances, so there is adequate time to assess risk factors and optimize the patient's medical status. Preoperative medical assessment is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative evaluation and management of patients with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For patients taking antiplatelet therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, or other indications, cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prior to elective pancreatic surgery has been done routinely. However, evidence suggests that this may not be necessary. In a retrospective review of 1017 patients undergoing pancreas resection, 28.4 percent were maintained on aspirin therapy throughout the perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among these patients, 699 underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 204 in the aspirin group and 484 in the nonaspirin group. Overall, there were no significant differences between the aspirin and nonaspirin groups for intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, or other major procedure-related complications. The aspirin group had a slightly increased rate of cardiovascular complications but the difference was not significant (10.1 versus 7 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>Although many of these patients have lost weight, most are still adequately nourished to safely undergo the pancreatic head resection. However, if the serum albumin is &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> or if surgery must be delayed for more than two weeks, we prescribe supplemental nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Nutrition can usually be provided enterally, but on occasion parenteral nutrition may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'The perioperative setting'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support#H466002282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Pancreatic enzyme replacement may also be useful, given that some of these patients have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency related either to underlying chronic pancreatitis or, sometimes, to the cancer itself (eg, a pancreatic head cancer causing obstruction of the main pancreatic duct). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Pancreatic enzyme supplements'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supportive-care-of-the-patient-with-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supportive care of the patient with locally advanced or metastatic exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Anorexia, cachexia, and weight loss'</a>.)</p><p>Once a decision has been made to proceed with surgery, the patient should be informed of the potential for surgical complications, as well as the possibility that pancreatic resection may not be possible if unrecognized metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease is identified. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949520\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative biliary drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pancreatic cancer who are jaundiced are at risk for associated coagulopathy, malabsorption, and malnutrition. It was hoped that relief of biliary obstruction preoperatively would correct these defects and decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. However, results from randomized trials have not been consistent. Uncertainty as to the benefit of preoperative biliary drainage has led to differing approaches. Some surgeons routinely decompress jaundiced patients with an endoscopically placed stent prior to surgery. However, most surgeons (including the author) reserve biliary decompression for selected patients whose serum bilirubin concentration exceeds 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> for those in whom surgery will be delayed for longer than two weeks, and in those with debilitating pruritus or cholangitis. </p><p>Although animal studies suggest that biliary drainage prior to pancreatic resection improved surgical outcomes, clinical studies in humans have not consistently shown a benefit. Multiple randomized trials have been conducted in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer and malignant obstructive jaundice, with one suggesting benefit for preoperative biliary drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], five, no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>], and three, potential harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/18,19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,23</a>]. An earlier Cochrane review had concluded that stented patients had significantly fewer postoperative complications but similar postsurgical mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, this analysis did not include data from the largest and most recent randomized trial of preoperative biliary drainage versus no drainage in 202 patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas, which showed a nonsignificant trend toward more surgery-related complications with preoperative biliary drainage (47 versus 37 percent, relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Later meta-analyses identified six trials (mostly patients with malignant obstructive jaundice, but some with benign disease), and included the larger, later trial in patients with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Again, no significant differences in mortality were seen, but overall serious morbidity was higher in the preoperative drainage group (60 per 100 patients versus 26 per 100 patients).</p><p>When stenting is chosen for jaundiced patients who will undergo pancreatic head resection, the type of stent placed should be reviewed with the surgeon prior to placement. We suggest a plastic biliary stent (&ge;10 French), keeping the proximal end of the stent at or below the level of the cystic duct takeoff. Metallic stents often incite a severe inflammatory reaction and may be incorporated into the bile duct wall, making them difficult to remove at the time of surgery. A metal stent that is placed too high into the common bile duct can complicate the surgery, although this is less of a concern when the latest covered metal stents are used. However, some surgeons have not found significant adverse effects using self-expanding metallic stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The experienced surgical oncologist may undertake vascular resection and replacement without assistance, but having a vascular surgeon on standby is prudent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis#H163631811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Vascular resection'</a>.)</p><p>Routine preoperative computerized tomographic angiography helps to identify hepatic vascular anatomy and prepares the surgeon for any potential vascular anomalies that may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The most common aberration in hepatic arterial anatomy is the replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56984 \">figure 1</a>). Every attempt should be made to preserve the aberrant vessel unless its resection is oncologically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949532\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949538\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We instruct patients to begin a clear liquid diet beginning two days before surgery; no mechanical bowel preparation is used. Extrapolating from systematic reviews of randomized trials that have not demonstrated a benefit for bowel preparation prior to elective colorectal surgery, bowel preparation is probably not necessary prior to pancreatic resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H149209272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Bowel preparation'</a>.)</p><p>One small randomized trial did not identify any beneficial effects for preoperative probiotics or selective decontamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These were not found to have any influence on bacterial translocation, intestinal permeability, or inflammatory mediator expression. However, bowel preparation continues to be a common practice. In a survey of perioperative practices among centers participating in the DISPACT trial, mechanical bowel preparation (mostly enemas) was used at 8 hospitals, but 14 hospitals did not use any kind of bowel preparation before distal pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949544\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For biliary tract surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for open procedures in patients at high risk for infection, defined as age greater than 70 years, acute cholecystitis, a nonfunctioning gallbladder, obstructive jaundice, and common bile duct stones. Appropriate antibiotics are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-measures-to-prevent-surgical-site-infection-following-gastrointestinal-procedures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control measures to prevent surgical site infection following gastrointestinal procedures in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some have speculated that antibiotics based upon the results of bile cultures obtained at the time of preoperative biliary stenting or intraoperatively would decrease the incidence of infectious complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/30,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32-34</a>]. In one review, prophylactic antibiotics were based upon the results of preoperative bile cultures in 46 patients who underwent preoperative biliary drainage and compared with 45 patients who did not undergo drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Overall complications and infection-related complications did not differ significantly between the drainage and nondrainage groups, respectively (overall: 30 versus 22 percent; 13 versus 11 percent). Using a different approach, a study at a single institution selected prophylactic antibiotics according to the susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from surgical site infections in an earlier group of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The incidence of surgical site infection in the later group who received the selected antibiotics was significantly lower compared with the earlier group (24.1 versus 46.6 percent). </p><p>For patients found to have bacteriobilia, the duration of antibiotic therapy remains in question. In a retrospective review of 197 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, patients in a &quot;control&quot; group received only perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and were compared with a &quot;treatment&quot; group who were continued on antibiotics until intraoperative bile culture results became available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In the &quot;treatment&quot; group, patients with bacteriobilia received 10 days of antibiotic treatment, which was otherwise discontinued in patients without bacteriobilia. Treatment of bacteriobilia was associated with a decreased rate of postoperative wound infections compared with only perioperative antibiotics in the &quot;control&quot; group (3 versus 12 percent). However, fewer patients in the control group had undergone preoperative biliary stenting (48 versus 67 percent), but a higher number of intraperitoneal drains were placed at the time of resection in the control group (85 versus 38 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949550\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboprophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy are at moderate to high risk for venous thromboembolism due to the nature of the surgery (major open surgery &gt;45 minutes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>). The presence of malignancy increases the risk. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have an even greater risk for venous thromboembolism than patients with other common adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A small study compared rates of venous thromboembolism among patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for malignancy before (n = 34) and after (n = 39) using a protocol that encouraged preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis (5000 units of subcutaneous heparin, preoperative checklist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The percentage of patients with venous thromboembolism decreased significantly after implementation of the protocol (17.6 versus 2.6 percent).</p><p>Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended for moderate and high-risk patients. We also place intermittent pneumatic compression devices prior to induction and continue their use until the patient is ambulatory.

For this reason, some surgeons prefer to begin cancer operations with laparoscopy, which permits examination of the liver and peritoneal surfaces, and biopsy of any suspicious areas. If a metastatic tumor is found, laparotomy may be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H1618421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>For patients undergoing pancreatic head resection, a drawback of staging laparoscopy is the additional time and expense required for the laparoscopic instrumentation, and the inability to determine whether any vascular invasion has occurred that would preclude an attempt at resection. Thus, we restrict the use of laparoscopy to cases where there is a high likelihood of unresectability that has not been confirmed preoperatively. Examples include some patients with pancreatic head cancer and computed tomography (CT) evidence of liver surface or other intraperitoneal metastases that have not been proven with biopsy, and patients with pancreatic head cancer and ascites, which is probably due to unrecognized peritoneal metastases.</p><p>If unresectable disease is found at the time of laparoscopy, and the patient has unrelieved obstructive jaundice or is at risk for gastric outlet obstruction, a laparoscopic palliative gastric or biliary bypass can be performed in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The postoperative endoscopic placement of a metal biliary stent is an acceptable alternative to operative biliary bypass.

Heterogeneity among the trials was noted by the authors with respect to methodology and outcome parameters.

The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences between the two procedures in terms of survival, postoperative mortality, and main morbidities (eg, pancreatic fistula, biliary leakage, or postoperative bleeding), except for delayed gastric emptying.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed gastric emptying was significantly more common after a pylorus preserving procedure than after conventional surgery (31 versus 24 percent, odds ratio [OR] 3.03, 95% CI 1.05-8.70). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operating time (weighted mean difference -45 minutes, 95% CI -75 to -16 minutes), red blood cell transfusion (weighted mean difference -0.47 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.07 units), and intraoperative blood loss (weighed mean difference -0.32 L, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.03 L) were all significantly reduced with the pylorus-preserving procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949640\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional versus stomach preserving</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One study has compared stomach preserving with standard or pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].&nbsp;Although the rate of delayed gastric emptying was marginally less for a stomach preserving compared with a pylorus-preserving operation, there was no difference from conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy. One trial that compared a stomach-preserving with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (50 patients in each group) found a reduced incidence of delayed gastric emptying for the stomach-preserving technique (10 versus 6 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

The incidence of ulceration may be higher with stomach-preserving techniques due to the retained antrum producing large amounts of gastrin compared with conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H926028478\"><span class=\"h3\">Open versus minimally-invasive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a relative late-comer in the minimally-invasive surgery revolution. The development of specialized instruments and technology were needed before minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy was even technically feasible. Even with robotic techniques, minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex operation that is suited for only selected patients in high-volume centers experienced with <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. As with open surgery, mortality after minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy was higher in low-volume hospitals than in high-volume hospitals (7.5 versus 3.4 percent), according to a meta-analysis of two registry studies that included close to 20,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review identified six retrospective studies that include 542 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (169 minimally invasive; 373 open) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Conversion to an open procedure was required in 10 percent of cases initially attempted laparoscopically. The minimally invasive approach was associated with longer operative times (weighted mean difference [WMD] 131 minutes, 95% CI 43-218), but lower intraoperative blood loss (WMD -1460 mL, 95% CI 726-2194). The rate of lymph node retrieval was significantly higher in the minimally invasive group (WMD -3 nodes, 95% CI 0.3-6.0 nodes), and the likelihood of an R0 resection was also higher. However, this is likely explained by the significantly larger tumor size in the open group. Also, patients with vascular involvement (known or identified intraoperatively) underwent open pancreaticoduodenectomy either as a primary procedure or via conversion from an initial laparoscopic approach. No significant difference in the number of lymph nodes retrieved was identified in a later systematic review that included two additional studies in their pooled estimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Hospital stay was significantly reduced for the minimally invasive group (weighted mean difference [WMD] -3.7 days, 95% CI 0.5-6.8 days). Overall morbidity, reoperations, rate of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (approximately 8 percent), and other complications, such as delayed gastric emptying and postoperative hemorrhage, were similar between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. In the later review, the risk of wound infection was significantly lower for the laparoscopic group (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Long-term oncologic outcomes were not addressed in the included studies. </p><p>A small randomized trial from India, which included 64 patients with periampullary tumors, largely echoed the findings of the above meta-analyses that laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy required longer operative time but shorter hospital stay (13 versus 7 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Intraoperative blood loss was also reduced with laparoscopic surgery. Other indicators of short-term surgical and oncologic outcomes, including mortality, major morbidity, rates of fistula, delayed gastric emptying, and postoperative hemorrhage, lymph node yield, and rate of R0 resection, were all comparable between patients who underwent open versus laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.</p><p>Robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy is plagued by long operative times and high conversion rates to open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

A systematic review of postoperative feeding routes following pancreaticoduodenectomy found that normal oral intake was established most quickly in patients in the oral diet group compared with enteral nutrition groups (via jejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Although an oral feeding route should be tried first, patients with perioperative complications may require nutritional support. In the systematic review, approximately 25 percent of patients fed orally required nutritional support, either because oral intake was insufficient or due to complications such as pancreatic fistula.

Participation from a local surgeon or other physician familiar with the patient and with whom the operating surgeon can communicate can be very helpful.

The T-tube is removed in the office three to four weeks later, usually without the need for a prior cholangiogram.</p><p>The peripancreatic drainage should be clear or straw-colored in appearance. Green-tinged fluid suggests the presence of bile. If the fluid is cloudy or turbulent, a pancreatic leak should be suspected and a fluid amylase level should be obtained. A drain fluid amylase level that is more than three times higher than the upper limit of normal for the serum amylase level defines a pancreatic leak. If a pancreatic leak is present, and the patient is ready for discharge, the drain should remain in place and can be removed in the outpatient setting once the fistula has resolved.

Somatostatin and its analogues may have an overall benefit in reducing morbidity following pancreatic operations, but the variable methods by which the agent is administered, outcomes reported, and definitions of complications, and particularly the definition of a pancreatic fistula, make it difficult to compare studies, or clearly identify a subgroup for whom prophylactic treatment should be considered, and the optimal means by which it should be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

The incidence of pancreatic fistula was reduced among those who received somatostatin analogues compared with controls (relative risk [RR] 0.66 95% CI 0.55-0.79); however, there were no significant differences in the rate of pancreatic fistula among the four trials that clearly distinguished clinically significant fistula. A significant decrease in the incidence of sepsis (RR 0.42 95% CI 0.21-0.85), risk for any complication, and number of complications was seen in the somatostatin analogue group (RR 0.70 95% CI 0.61-0.80, RR 0.70 95% CI 0.60-0.82). No significant differences were identified for rates of reoperation, anastomotic leak, postoperative pancreatitis, renal failure, bleeding, abdominal collections, delayed gastric emptying, or length of hospital stay. No differences in mortality rate with and without somatostatin analogues have been identified in several systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/114,115,117,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115,117,122</a>]. </p><p>A subsequent trial evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasireotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pasireotide</a>, which has a longer half-life than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and a different binding profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Three hundred patients received pasireotide (900 micrograms subcutaneously) or placebo on the morning of the pancreatic surgery (pancreatoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) and continued for one week postoperatively. The overall incidence (head or tail resection) of the primary combined endpoint of grade 3 or higher postoperative pancreatic fistula, leak or abscess was significantly lower in the pasireotide group (9.2 versus 20.9 percent) and also significantly lower for those who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (10 versus 21 percent). The overall rate of the secondary endpoint of grade B or C postoperative pancreatic fistula was also significantly reduced in the pasireotide group (7.9 versus 16.9 percent). The character of the pancreas (eg, duct dilation, softness of pancreatic tissue), and the use of postoperative pancreatic drains, which are thought to affect the risk for postoperative pancreatic fistula, were similar between the groups. Furthermore, the interaction between the pasireotide group and a subgroup defined according to placement or nonplacement of a drain was also not significant. The two most common adverse events associated with pasireotide were hyperglycemia and dose-limiting nausea (17 percent). The benefit with pasireotide, in contrast to prior results with octreotide, may be related to differences in their pharmacologic profiles. These results need to be confirmed by additional trials, but may justify wider use of the drug. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176949700\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although previously associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, modern series show that in experienced hands, the conventional Whipple procedure is associated with a perioperative mortality rate of less than 4 percent, and 20 to 30 percent five-year survival in completely resected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas/abstract/124-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">124-130</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H176949592\" class=\"local\">'Pancreaticoduodenectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative imaging with high-resolution computerized tomographic (CT) scan with 1 to 2 mm cuts through the pancreas during the early arterial phase (pancreatic protocol) provides the best assessment of resectability. (See <a href=\"#H176949502\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with serum albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> or if surgery must be delayed for more than several weeks, supplemental nutrition should be provided.

We suggest biliary decompression for selected patients in whom surgery will be delayed for longer than two weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), and we recommend it in the presence of cholangitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We do not routinely place biliary stents. (See <a href=\"#H176949520\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative biliary drainage'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a high likelihood of unresectability that has not been confirmed preoperatively, staging laparoscopy permits examination of the liver and peritoneal surfaces, as well as biopsy of any suspicious areas. If metastatic tumor is found, laparotomy may be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H176949568\" class=\"local\">'Staging laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is any suspicion of a pancreatic leak, the amylase concentration of the drain output is measured to confirm the diagnosis, and the drain should be kept in place until the drainage stops.
