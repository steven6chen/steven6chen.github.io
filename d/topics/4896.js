HTN in childhood and adolescence may contribute to premature atherosclerosis and the early development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As a result, identifying children with HTN and successfully treating their HTN may have an important impact on long-term outcomes of CVD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and development of atherosclerosis in childhood&quot;, section on 'Atherosclerotic changes in childhood'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and development of atherosclerosis in childhood&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Rationale for intervention'</a>.)</p><p>The definition and diagnosis of HTN in children will be reviewed here.

As was true with previous guidelines, high BP, including HTN, is defined from normative distribution of BP data in healthy children that includes children from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and other screening studies. This is in contrast to adult HTN, which is primarily defined by clinical outcome data (ie, risk of cardiovascular disease [CVD] and mortality) from large trials of antihypertensive therapy. However, these outcome measures cannot be applied to children because cardiovascular (CV) events other than left ventricular hypertrophy do not typically occur in childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because height and gender are important determinants of pediatric BP, BP levels are interpreted based on gender, age, and height. In the 2017 AAP guidelines, normative tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>) were revised by using data only from normal-weight children. The revised tables excluded BP data from overweight and obese children (ie, children with BMI &ge;85<sup>th</sup> percentile) that were previously included in normative BP databases. As a result, BP values are several mmHg lower than similar tables in previously published normative values by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The age- and height-specific blood pressure percentiles may be determined using calculators for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). </p><p>In children, definitions that categorize BP values were modified by the 2017 AAP guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574 \">table 1</a>) into two age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, the newly revised definitions for adolescents are aligned with adult guidelines for the detection of chronic elevated BP. With an acute elevation of BP, it is the magnitude and the rate of increase above baseline that determines the risk of serious morbidity and, at times, mortality.

However, in addition to the age restriction at or above six years, variations in population factors (eg, diet, activity, and perhaps genetic predisposition) and the lack of outcome data limit the general clinical applicability of these values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>As a result, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), used the normative data from the 2004 United States NHBPEP for children up to 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For individuals 16 years or older, the ESH guidelines recommend using adult thresholds that were being used at the time when the ESH guidelines were published. However, since publication, definitions for prehypertension and hypertension for adults have also been revised (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prehypertension &ndash; SBP between 130 and 139 mmHg and DBP between 85 and 89 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 HTN &ndash; SBP between 140 and 159 mmHg and DBP between 90 and 99 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 HTN &ndash; SBP between 160 and 179 mmHg and DBP between 100 and 109 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States and Europe, the diagnosis of persistent childhood HTN is made when repeat blood pressure (BP) values on <strong>three</strong> separate visits are greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the age, gender, and height of the patient, or it is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/80</span> mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,14</a>].

The clinical importance of tracking in children with annual BP over the age of three years is related to the ability to predict BP status later in childhood and adulthood. Children, especially adolescents, who are hypertensive are more likely to remain hypertensive throughout childhood and as adults, particularly in the presence of a family history of HTN, increased body weight, or increased left ventricular mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-etiology-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and etiology of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801709420\"><span class=\"h2\">Societal and governmental recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there was inadequate evidence to support BP screening in asymptomatic children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease (VCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, we believe that the measurement of BP is a readily available, noninvasive procedure in office settings and that it should remain a routine part of comprehensive clinical care of children and adolescents as noted by the following national societies that continue to support routine BP measurement at well-child visits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>Atherosclerosis, Hypertension, and Obesity in Youth committee of the AHA</strong> concluded that the USPSTF recommendation was flawed because the evidence considered by the Task Force was too narrowly selected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although 1059 articles were identified after a literature search and abstract review, only 35 articles describing 34 studies were included in the statement. In particular, short-term and large observational studies, which have shown that pediatric BP levels are predictive of adult BP and indirectly associated with CVD, were not considered. Other issues that were not addressed by the USPSTF review included prevention of targeted end-organ injury with treatment of pediatric HTN and improved accuracy of BP measurement by using ambulatory and home monitoring, or the inclusion of data on the reduction of BP with drug therapy. In conclusion, the AHA committee continued to support routine BP measures based on their position that one cannot ignore lower quality research (eg, observational studies) when superior evidence (eg, clinical trials) is not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>American Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ASPN)</strong> concluded that the USPSTF analysis failed to consider several important aspects of BP measurements, which resulted in a faulty conclusion regarding the value of routine pediatric BP screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These included that the definition of HTN is based on three separate measurements, thereby reducing the risk of false-positive diagnoses (a concern of the USPSTF review), that no serious adverse events have ever been reported as a consequence of BP measurements, concern that the USPSTF review underestimated the incidence of primary HTN, and that the USPSTF review did not include data of adverse events from studies of longer duration than four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2016 <strong>European Society of Hypertension (ESH)</strong> guidelines concurred that BP should be routinely screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They concluded that BP screening, which is not invasive, expensive, or time consuming, could improve health outcomes. The ESH guidelines recommend screening at three years of age, with re-evaluation every two years for normotensive children and yearly for those who are prehypertensive without evidence of end-organ damage. Children who are diagnosed with HTN should be referred to a clinician with expertise in managing pediatric HTN.</p><p/><p>The rationale for diagnosing and treating pediatric HTN is discussed separately.

Confounding factors included cuff size, technique used (ie, patient position and the choice of fourth or fifth Korotkoff sound to determine diastolic BP [DBP]), the number of measurements made, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> type of instruments used.

The correct choice of cuff is important for accurate BP measurement. If too small a cuff is used, the pressure generated by inflating the cuff may not be fully transmitted to the brachial artery. In this setting, the pressure in the cuff may be considerably higher than the intra-arterial pressure, leading to overestimation of the systolic pressure. On the other hand, too wide a cuff may produce lower readings than the actual intra-arterial pressure.</p><p>The cuff size should have a bladder width that is approximately 40 percent of the circumference of the upper arm, measured midway between the olecranon and the acromion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73414 \">figure 1</a>).

The mercury sphygmomanometer is the most accurate instrument, but its availability is restricted because of the potential risk of mercury poisoning.

The BP should be taken with the patient's right arm supported at the level of the heart. The right arm is preferred in repeated measures of BP for consistency and comparison with standard tables. In addition, the possibility of coarctation of the aorta would lead to falsely low BP readings in the left arm. Allowing the arm to hang below the heart will elevate BP levels by the added hydrostatic pressure induced by gravity (as much as 10 to 12 mmHg in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].
