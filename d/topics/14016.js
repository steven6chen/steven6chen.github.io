In a study of 31 patients with antibiotic-dependent pouchitis who received VSL#3 as maintenance therapy after remission was induced with ciprofloxacin, 25 patients (81 percent) discontinued the probiotic at eight months due to the lack of efficacy or the development of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pouchitis-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Pouchitis is classified based on the duration of symptoms (acute versus chronic), response to antibiotics (antibiotic-responsive versus antibiotic-dependent versus antibiotic-refractory), the frequency of flares (infrequent versus relapsing), and the etiology (idiopathic versus secondary). (See <a href=\"#H3136327954\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute pouchitis, we suggest initial treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 1 g daily for 14 days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with acute pouchitis who do not respond to initial antibiotic treatment, we perform antibiotic-based coliform sensitivity testing to guide antibiotic selection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93168\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93168 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3136328021\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic pouchitis, we begin with fecal coliform culture and sensitivity testing to identify effective antimicrobial agents. In patients with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis, secondary factors associated with an antibiotic-refractory course should be sought and treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F93169\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93169 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3136328040\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3136328046\" class=\"local\">'Evaluate and treat secondary causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who respond to initial treatment but have relapsing symptoms at least three times within one year, or within one month of discontinuation of antibiotics, we suggest using maintenance therapy with probiotic VSL#3 (6 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> or chronic low-dose antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3136328021\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3136328058\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Probiotics for gastrointestinal diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform endoscopic surveillance of the pouch in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease based on their risk of pouch neoplasia.
