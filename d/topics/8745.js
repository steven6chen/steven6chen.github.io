In addition, many RCCs are clinically silent for much of their course, and the initial diagnosis can be delayed until disease is either locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. The natural history of disease for patients with advanced or metastatic RCC can vary widely from a few months to many years depending on the clinical, pathologic, laboratory, and radiographic features of disease, as well as the response to therapy.</p><p>Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has become a major modality for the treatment of clear cell RCC, both as initial therapy and after antiangiogenic therapy for those initially treated with targeted agents. This topic will review the data supporting the role of checkpoint inhibitors. The topic will also briefly review data on older immunotherapy approaches and discuss newer, experimental immunotherapy approaches. </p><p>An overview of the treatment approach to RCC, prognostic factors in RCC, and the use of antiangiogenic and molecularly targeted therapy are discussed separately.

Since that time, exponential advances in the understanding of the intersection between immune surveillance and tumor growth and development have led to broad therapeutic advances that are now being studied in all cancer types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Removal of primary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) can evoke an immune response that occasionally results in spontaneous and dramatic remissions in metastases, particularly in the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These observations were followed by the clinical demonstration of antitumor activity with the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-alfa (IFNa), although only a minority of patients derived major clinical benefit.</p><p>Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies directed against the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has become an integral part of the management of advanced melanoma and other malignancies.
