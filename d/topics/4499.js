Hemodialysis patients are vulnerable to contaminants in the water used to prepare concentrate and dialysis fluid or in water used for reprocessing dialyzers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reuse-of-dialyzers#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reuse of dialyzers&quot;, section on 'Reprocessing techniques'</a>). This vulnerability is due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are exposed to extremely large volumes of water. The estimated water intake of a healthy individual is 2 L per day or 14 L per week. By comparison, during a single dialysis treatment lasting four hours, performed at a dialysis fluid flow rate of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> a hemodialysis patient is exposed to 192 L of water or to 576 L per week, if treated three times weekly. This exposure may increase further if the patient is treated by daily or nocturnal hemodialysis schedules, particularly if conventional rather than reduced dialysis fluid flow rates are used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients have inadequate barriers to waterborne contaminants. In healthy individuals who are not on dialysis, the gastrointestinal tract separates blood from contaminants in the water. By comparison, the barrier between blood and water in hemodialysis patients is the membrane within the hemodialyzer through which transfer of contaminants is limited only by the size of the contaminant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are unable to renally excrete any contaminants taken up from the dialysate.</p><p/><p>Waterborne contaminants to which hemodialysis patients are exposed are reviewed here. The different water purification systems and methods of monitoring the various water delivery systems are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintaining water quality for hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water used for the preparation of dialysis fluid is generally derived from a source of potable water, such as a large municipal water supply, a community water system, or, in the case of patients treated at home in a rural area, from a private well. Within the United States, public water systems should meet the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which contain legally enforceable standards and treatment techniques for public water systems. Private wells are not regulated in the same way. The EPA merely recommends the testing of private wells and offers guidance on technologies that can be used to remove any contaminants; monitoring water quality is the responsibility of the well owner. </p><p>The approach is similar in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where the Drinking Water Inspectorate delegates responsibility for private wells to the local authority, which acts as the regulator for those water sources. For countries without appropriate legislative or administrative frameworks, the World Health Organization (WHO) publishes guidelines on drinking water standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients at dialysis facilities located within areas with less sophisticated municipal water treatment are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from contaminants in the source water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In 2009, the United States Geological Survey studied the water quality of over 2000 private wells to assess the existence and extent of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study found that water from approximately 23 percent of the wells had at least one contaminant at a level of potential health concern. More recently, it was reported that 21 million people in the United States relied on community water systems that violated health-based quality standards, particularly in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United Kingdom, a study of tap water from 497 properties using private water supplies in an area of metalliferous and arsenic mineralization found that 65 percent of samples contained one or more contaminants at levels exceeding drinking water quality standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Nonconformity with the requirements for drinking water is not limited to chemical contaminants. A public health study of the occurrence of pathogens in untreated water from 244 US public water supply wells found that approximately 50 percent of wells initially considered more vulnerable to contamination and 40 percent of wells considered less vulnerable were positive for one or more fecal indicators (total coliform bacteria, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, enterococci, viruses infecting coliform bacteria, and human viruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Ensuring a safe water supply from which to produce dialysis water is a growing challenge in the face of aging infrastructure, impaired source water, and strained finances. No water supply can be considered safe for use in hemodialysis applications, unless treated further at the point of use. Furthermore, some of the contaminants most potentially toxic to dialysis patients arise from municipal water treatment practices that are instituted for public safety.</p><p>Even when water quality meets the statutory requirements for drinking water, concentrations of some water contaminants may expose hemodialysis patients to risk. Such contaminants include trace elements, such as zinc, which may be leached from plumbing components; sulfates; nitrates; or organic contaminants leached from soil or present in groundwater. (See <a href=\"#H2107729\" class=\"local\">'Trace elements and other chemicals'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2107794\" class=\"local\">'Organic contaminants'</a> below.)</p><p>Some of the contaminants that are the most toxic to hemodialysis patients are those that are added to drinking water for public health benefits and are not generally present in source water. These include aluminum, chlorine or chloramine (in the form of monochloramine), and fluoride (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64883 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F95195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95195 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H91199980\" class=\"local\">'Additives to drinking water'</a> below.)</p><p>Other contaminants are introduced after water enters the dialysis facility or hospital. These include disinfectants and antimicrobial agents added to prevent the proliferation of microbes and bacteria.

These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Aluminum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aluminum is toxic to hemodialysis patients. Various salts of aluminum, such as alum, are added to drinking water in order to facilitate chemical precipitation and flocculation of colloidal particles (turbidity) and microbes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In hemodialysis patients, exposure to aluminum can result in a severe neurologic syndrome characterized by the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aluminum toxicity in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients undergoing hemodialysis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoclonic muscle spasms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personality changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia</p><p/><p>Chronic exposure to aluminum is also associated with severe bone disease and erythropoietin (EPO)-resistant anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

The incidence of aluminum toxicity today is at the level of case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nonetheless, occasional, sporadic outbreaks of aluminum intoxication have been reported (eg, an outbreak in 1994 was traced to aggressive alum flocculation of water under conditions of extreme drought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]), while, in 2001, acute aluminum encephalopathy in a dialysis center was attributed to aluminum leaching from a cement mortar water distribution pipe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Aluminum toxicity has also been reported from the contamination of water from within the dialysis facility as a result of the use of aluminum pumps that drive the delivery of acid concentrate, which is used for bicarbonate dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The sporadic nature of reported aluminum exposure, as well as the low prevalence of aluminum toxicity among hemodialysis patients, has raised debate among some in the dialysis community regarding the value of patient serum aluminum screening, which some hemodialysis units conduct routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines recommend serum aluminum testing at least annually in all hemodialysis patients, and it should be considered in any patient showing signs or symptoms of aluminum toxicity as hemodialysis patients using aluminum-containing phosphate binders continue to be at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Chloramines are widely used in place of chlorine as they remain active for longer in the water, do not give off any taste or smell, and react less with organic matter that may be present in the water to produce trihalomethanes (THM), compounds associated with health risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Within the United States, the presence of trihalomethanes in drinking water is subject to control under the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which limit the total concentration of the four chief trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, and dibromochloromethane), referred to as total trihalomethanes, to 80 parts per billion in treated water.</p><p>When chlorine and ammonia react, three different inorganic chloramines can be formed: monochloramine (NH<sub>2</sub>Cl), dichloramine (NHCl<sub>2</sub>), and trichloramine (NCl<sub>3</sub>). Which chloramines form is highly dependent upon pH, the ratio of chlorine to ammonia-nitrogen, and, to a lesser extent, temperature and contact time. A pH of between approximately 7.5 and 9 is optimum for the formation of monochloramine, the ideal pH being 8.3. Consequently, the most common chloramine present in public water supplies is monochloramine, a compound that is frequently referred to as chloramine in publications.</p><p>Exposure of hemodialysis patients to both chlorine and chloramines is associated with hemolytic reactions (hemolysis, hemolytic anemia, and methemoglobinemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/13,21,24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,24-30</a>] and, possibly, EPO resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>].

During dialysis, fluoride is removed from the plasma, but the removal rate is less than for other small molecules such as urea and creatinine, resulting in the presence of elevated plasma fluoride levels in dialysis patients. It has been speculated that such elevated plasma serum fluoride levels contribute to metabolic bone disease; however, the evidence to support this is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/13,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,35</a>].</p><p>Deionizers have a limited capacity for anion removal, and, if operated to exhaustion, anions previously removed may be released.

They are produced by cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, found naturally in surface waters, and are known to attack the liver or the nervous system or simply to irritate the skin. The three most commonly occurring cyanotoxins in sources of drinking water throughout the United States are microcystin-LR, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin, of which microcystin-LR is the most toxic.</p><p>Exposure of dialysis patients to cyanotoxins occurred in Brazil in 1996 and 2001. During the first incident, patients were exposed to high (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L)</span> levels of microcystin and suffered liver failure, visual abnormalities, and death. The second incident, in 2001, involved a lower level of exposure (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/L)</span> and resulted in milder clinical sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/2,74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,74-78</a>].</p><p>Development of regulatory guidelines or standards for cyanobacteria or their toxins in drinking water is an emerging area because of the increase in cyanobacterial blooms. Within the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed health advisory recommendations for concentrations of cyanotoxins in drinking water, namely that, for adults, the recommended levels for drinking water are at or below 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> for microcystins and 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/</span> L for cylindrospermopsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Most municipal water treatment plants do not regularly screen for cyanobacterial toxins in the water supply unless cyanobacteria are present in the source water. Once cyanobacteria are detected in the water supply, treatment can remove them using a variety of different methods. However, these methods do not remove potentially harmful cyanobacterial toxins, which can only be removed using oxidation procedures or activated charcoal. Both powdered activated carbon (PAC) and granular activated carbon (GAC) are effective in adsorbing microcystin and cylindrospermopsin, although microcystin variants can have different adsorption efficiencies. The performance of activated carbon depends on the concentration of the toxin and the dose and origin of the activated carbon. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are also effective in removing cylindrospermopsin and microcystin, but removal efficiency depends on the membrane pore size distribution and water quality.</p><p>Two questions with respect to cyanotoxins remain: First, what is the likelihood of encountering cyanotoxins in drinking water, and, second, what might be an acceptable level in the water used for the preparation of dialysis fluid if such compounds are present? In one study, the incidence and levels of cyanotoxins were monitored over a 12- to 16-week period spanning spring and summer at five different locations in the US (California, Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, and Vermont) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. In general, microcystins were frequently observed in the raw water at low concentrations between 0.05 and 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L</span>. Cylindrospermopsin was only detected in one raw water sample (0.41 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L),</span> and no cyanotoxins were detected in any finished drinking water. These levels are lower than those measured in Brazil, and both reverse osmosis and nanofiltration can remove microcystins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>]. Although removal is also possible via GAC, it is more limited.</p><p>In the absence of concentration-toxicity data for contaminants, the US and international standards for dialysis water set the maximum allowable levels of potentially toxic contaminants at 10 percent of the levels allowed in drinking water. On that basis and using the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional drinking water guideline for microcystin-LR concentration of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L,</span> based on lifetime exposure, the maximum concentration for microcystins in dialysis water would be 10 percent of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L,</span> or 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L</span>. While such a level is well below the levels monitored during outbreaks in Brazil and noted in the study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], it is difficult to be confident that an upper limit of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/L</span> of microcystins can be accurately detected.</p><p>For that reason, further study is required to establish with greater certainty a safe level of cyanotoxins in dialysis water and whether or not dialysis water treatment systems are adequate to achieve such a level. In the meantime, as cyanobacterial blooms appear to be increasing in many areas, there needs to be increased awareness of their toxic potential. Dialysis facilities should establish a means of communication with their municipal water providers so that they are aware of any cyanobacterial blooms in the surface waters used for the supply.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water quality requirements for dialysis and or reprocessing of dialyzers are generally the same for any hemodialysis setting, including in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, and hemodialysis in an acute-care setting.</p><p>Water quality requirements are outlined in international standards (International Organization for Standardization [ISO] publications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], national standards (generally an adoption of the international standards, either in their entirety or with national deviations), or guidelines for clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>], which define the maximum permitted levels of chemical and microbiologic contaminants and provide methods for their quantitation. The use of standards or nationally developed guidelines is generally voluntary. However, in the United States, the situation is more complex. As part of its oversight activities, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires providers of dialysis to comply with certain performance criteria intended to promote improved outcomes and ensure the safety of dialysis patients. These requirements are detailed in the CMS Conditions for Coverage for End-Stage Renal Disease Facilities (CfC). Following publication in 1981 of the original Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) hemodialysis standard (American National Standards Institute <span class=\"nowrap\">[ANSI]/AAMI</span> RD5, Hemodialysis Systems), CMS, then known as the Health Care Financing Administration, made compliance with the water quality standard part of the CfC. That requirement was limited to complying with the maximum allowable contaminant levels and the guideline for monitoring water quality. If hemodialyzers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood lines were being reprocessed, a dialysis facility was also required to adhere to the <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> recommended practice for the reprocessing of dialyzers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>In 2008, 30 years after its initial publication, CMS published a major revision of the CfC in which the simple requirement that the water used for hemodialysis comply with the <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standard was replaced by incorporation of essentially all of the then existing <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> recommended practice for dialysate preparation <span class=\"nowrap\">(ANSI/AAMI</span> RD52:2004) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], including its guidelines for fluid quality, water treatment equipment, and monitoring. Since 2008, <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standards have continued to evolve and be updated. As a consequence, the CfC no longer mirrors the recommendations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standards. There are now important discrepancies relating to the maximum allowable levels for bacteria and endotoxin in water and dialysis fluid and in approaches to maintaining compliance with the fluid quality standards. <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standards emphasize compliance through the development and implementation of a facility-specific quality management program, in contrast to the prescriptive approach contained in the CfC.</p><p>These divergent approaches inevitably create problems for dialysis facilities, dialysis professionals, and the surveyors responsible for ensuring compliance with the CfC. To help address these problems, and to ensure compliance with the CfC, AAMI has published a side-by-side comparison of the relevant sections of the CfC and <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standards published as successors to the historic <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> RD5:2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical contaminants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the United States, all dialysis facilities must use water that complies with specified maximum allowable levels of chemical contaminants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71221 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Utilizing the lower action level is important because seven days can elapse before results of testing for microbiologic contamination are known, during which time significant bacterial proliferation may occur.</p><p>As noted above, the CMS CfC do not mirror the recommendations contained in the standards and retain the maximum allowable levels for bacteria and endotoxin in water and dialysate published in <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> RD52:2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], which predate the more stringent standards for the microbiological quality of dialysate that were introduced by the ISO and <span class=\"nowrap\">ANSI/AAMI</span> standards in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].

However, in the United States, in order to be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid programs, dialysis facilities must demonstrate compliance with standards published by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI; &quot;Dialysate for hemodialysis,&quot; American National Standards Institute <span class=\"nowrap\">[ANSI]/AAMI</span> RD52:2004) and, if reprocessing hemodialyzers and blood lines, with the requirements set forth in the AAMI publication, &quot;Reuse of Hemodialyzers,&quot; third edition, <span class=\"nowrap\">(ANSI/AAMI</span> RD47:2002 and <span class=\"nowrap\">RD47:2002/A1:2003)</span>.
