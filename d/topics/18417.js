Clinical trials have demonstrated that MRA therapy reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.</p><p>The indications, efficacy, risks, and mechanisms of benefit of MRA therapy in systolic HF will be reviewed here. Overall management of systolic HF and use of MRAs in patients with diastolic HF are discussed separately.

To the degree that the latter effect is important, a similar benefit would <strong>not </strong>be expected with other potassium-sparing diuretics (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Raising serum potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism may preserve serum potassium concentration and thus counter the risk of hypokalemia and associated arrhythmic risk caused by non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Support for this mechanism comes from observation of increased arrhythmic mortality in patients with HF treated with non-potassium-sparing diuretics alone in a retrospective analysis of data from the SOLVD trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this study of data from 6797 patients with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) class II to III HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 36 percent, diuretic use, compared with no diuretic use, was associated with a higher incidence of overall mortality, cardiovascular deaths (11.4 versus 4.6 percent per year), and arrhythmic or sudden death. The risk of arrhythmic death associated with the use of non-potassium-sparing diuretics was significantly elevated (relative risk 1.33) after controlling for disease severity, comorbid illnesses, and concomitant medications, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In comparison, there was no association between arrhythmic death and use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, either alone or in combination with a non-potassium-sparing agent.</p><p>MRA therapy reduced the risk of hypokalemia in patients with systolic HF in clinical trials (eg, in the EPHESUS trial, serum potassium &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> occurred in 8.4 with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> versus 13.1 percent with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>However, it seems unlikely that maintenance of serum potassium concentration is the main mechanism for MRA benefit in HF.

The latter effect is mediated by the induction of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) by angiotensin II in the failing ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Locally produced aldosterone may create a vicious cycle by stimulating angiotensin converting enzymes in the local renin-angiotensin system, an effect blocked by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Direct effects of aldosterone on the heart may include promoting the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], proarrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and, with chronic pressure overload, the transition from hypertrophy to HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Activatable mineralocorticoid receptors are also present in coronary artery and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These receptors can be activated by aldosterone as well as by angiotensin II; thus, inhibition of this system may contribute to the beneficial effects of angiotensin inhibition in patients with HF. Activation of these receptors may contribute to the increased incidence of stroke and coronary events in patients with primary aldosteronism compared with matched patients with primary (essential) hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Support for a pathogenetic role for aldosterone in humans with HF comes from the following observations in RALES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with higher serum concentrations of markers of collagen synthesis (procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide, procollagen type I amino-terminal peptide, and procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide) had higher rates of death and hospitalization.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Spironolactone</a>, but not placebo, reduced the serum concentrations of these markers, and the survival benefit of spironolactone was primarily seen in patients with higher procollagen concentrations. The reduction in procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide also correlated with an improvement in LV remodeling and a reduction in the serum concentrations of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide, which are markers of myocardial remodeling, disease severity, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Angiotensin II is the major physiologic stimulus to aldosterone secretion; as a result, reducing angiotensin II production with an ACE inhibitor should lower plasma aldosterone levels. </p><p>A possible explanation for the beneficial effect of MRA in patients with HF treated with an ACE inhibitor is that many of these patients have plasma aldosterone concentrations above the upper limit of normal (11 of 34 in one report), often with virtually complete inhibition of vascular angiotensin converting enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The stimulus to aldosterone secretion in such patients could be mediated by tissue renin-angiotensin systems not inhibited by the ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II generation via pathways not requiring angiotensin converting enzyme, or other stimuli such as a high serum potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which is not uncommon in patients with advanced HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1100623\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend administration of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) to patients who satisfy requirements for renal function and serum potassium and fulfill the criteria of RALES (current or recent New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III to IV heart failure [HF] and left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &le;35 percent) or the entry criteria in EPHESUS (recent myocardial infarction and LVEF &le;40 percent plus symptomatic HF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend addition of MRA therapy (to angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB; but not both] or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor and beta blocker therapy) in patients who have symptomatic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent, who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also recommend MRA therapy for patients post-ST elevation myocardial infarction who are already receiving therapeutic doses of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, have an LVEF &le;40 percent, and have either symptomatic HF or diabetes mellitus, who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). MRA therapy is limited to patients with baseline serum potassium &lt;5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> therapy should undergo serial monitoring of serum potassium and renal function. A specific approach to minimizing hyperkalemia has been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67783 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2683266\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H373926551\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support for use of an MRA in patients with systolic HF comes from randomized trials in which treatment with these agents reduced morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H373925744\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRA therapy is effective in combination with beta blocker therapy and ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with systolic HF. However, the combination of MRA therapy and ACE inhibitor plus ARB therapy is <strong>not</strong> recommended. In patients who are appropriate candidates for ACE inhibitor plus MRA therapy, the addition of an ARB is <strong>not </strong>recommended.
