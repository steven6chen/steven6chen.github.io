The probable histology varies according to the age of the patient. Masses in the pelvis, although usually of gynecologic origin, can also arise from the urinary tract, bowel, or other pelvic structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Ovarian <span class=\"nowrap\">cysts/masses</span> may represent physiologic cysts, benign neoplasms, or malignant neoplasms. They may be associated with pain or present as an asymptomatic mass. Although relatively rare, they are the most common genital neoplasms occurring in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Historically, all ovarian <span class=\"nowrap\">cysts/masses</span> discovered in infants, children, and adolescents were removed surgically. However, the identification of tumor markers and advances in radiologic imaging facilitate a risk assessment and allow a more conservative approach to the management of these neoplasms, with ovarian preservation as the standard except in cases of cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization classifies ovarian neoplasms based upon histologic cell type and benign versus malignant state (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77703\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77703 \">table 1</a>). The majority of ovarian tumors in girls and adolescents are of germ cell origin. By comparison, epithelial tumors account for the largest proportion of ovarian neoplasms in adults.

However, it is important for the clinician to establish an early diagnosis to reduce the risk of ovarian torsion with possible loss of adnexa and to improve the prognosis for those lesions that are malignant.

In one autopsy series of 332 ovaries from stillbirths and neonatal deaths, one or more follicular cysts lined by granulosa epithelium and having a diameter greater than 1 mm were detected in 113 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among live births, the best estimate of the incidence of clinically significant ovarian cysts is 1 in 2500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is based upon sonographically determined presence of four criteria: female sex, nonmidline regular cystic structure, normal-appearing urinary tract, and normal-appearing gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Size and appearance are used to characterize cysts as probably physiologic or probably pathologic. Simple cysts less than 2 cm in diameter are considered normal and are physiologic. Larger and complex cysts are more likely to be nonphysiologic. Associated anomalies are rare since the cysts usually result from hormonal stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The etiology is unclear, but they most likely arise from ovarian stimulation by maternal and fetal gonadotropin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, including 324 fetal ovarian cysts that were observed, 46 percent resolved spontaneously (10 percent prenatally and 36 percent after birth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rate of spontaneous resolution decreased with increasing size, from approximately 90 percent for cysts &le;29 mm to approximately 20 percent for those &ge;60 mm. In a separate review of 66 published cases of simple cysts, 50 percent resolved by one month of age, 75 percent by two months, and 90 percent by three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate of malignancy is so low that it need not be considered in making therapeutic decisions.</p><p>Ultrasound examination should be performed every three to four weeks antenatally. After birth, neonatal management is as described below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cysts in neonates'</a> below.)</p><p>Complications that can occur include intracystic hemorrhage, rupture with possible intra-abdominal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal or urinary tract obstruction, ovarian torsion and necrosis, incarceration in an inguinal hernia, difficulty with delivery due to fetal abdominal dystocia, and respiratory distress at birth from a mass effect on the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59977 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. If in-utero torsion occurs, the ovary may undergo necrosis and develop into a calcified mass, a sessile mass, or disappear entirely. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, the rate of ovarian torsion was 31 percent among 324 cysts that were observed and 11 percent among 56 cysts that were aspirated prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

There was inability to appreciate the ovary in 8 of 11 ovaries in which the cysts appeared complex on the first postnatal scan (two were treated with postnatal salpingo-oophorectomy; one was treated with postnatal aspiration; the remainder were observed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These data suggest that prenatally detected ovarian cysts should be closely monitored, particularly if the cyst appears complex on postnatal sonography, due to the increased risk of torsion and subsequent ovarian loss.</p><p>Antenatal aspiration of large cysts (greater than 40 to 60 mm) under ultrasound guidance has been advocated to reduce the risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]; however, the role of this technique is questionable because of possible misdiagnosis and potential complications from the aspiration technique itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In particular, small anechoic cysts are likely to resolve spontaneously and should be left alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, a large cyst that undergoes torsion may lead to loss of the ovary and impair future fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Advantages of aspiration include elimination of the cyst with reduction of the risk of cyst-related complications and need for neonatal surgery. Disadvantages are risk of spillage and absence of data on the true risks and benefits of this procedure. Complex cysts cannot be aspirated.</p><p>Most fetuses can be delivered vaginally, with cesarean delivery reserved for the usual obstetric indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cesarean birth may be the preferred route of delivery of fetuses with very large cysts to prevent rupture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dystocia.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Neonatal cysts may have been initially detected on antenatal sonographic examination or may be identified as an asymptomatic abdominal mass because of displacement upward and out of the narrow neonatal pelvis. The ovary containing the cyst is generally freely mobile.</p><p>Ultrasound examination may show a simple (clear, fluid-filled) or complex (fluid, debris, septa, solid components, echogenic wall) sonographic pattern. A complex sonographic appearance makes a precise diagnosis more difficult.

Parents or other caregivers should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of torsion (lower abdominal pain of sudden onset, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever) so they can seek emergency care without delay. An ultrasound evaluation showing a size discrepancy in the ovarian volumes with classic peripheralization of follicles is helpful in determining the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>An attempt should always be made to salvage the torsed ovary by untwisting the vascular pedicle. A bivalve technique (ie, opening of the ovarian cortex with a linear incision) can be used to try to salvage a dark-appearing torsed ovary; this technique decreases the intraovarian pressure caused by venous occlusion and permits arterial flow into the ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, in rare instances, oophorectomy is necessary because of severe necrosis, or nonviable appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Failure to regress also increases the suspicion that the cyst represents nonovarian pathology.</p><p>Serial ultrasound examinations should continue until the cyst resolves, enlarges, has persisted for four to six months, or becomes symptomatic.

In contrast to antenatal cyst aspiration, the value and safety of neonatal cyst aspiration has been clearly established because the diagnosis is more certain and the risk of complications is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>].

Nevertheless, most simple ovarian cysts in children are physiologic and result from enlargement of a cystic follicle.</p><p>Some ovarian cysts are hormonally active and result in precocious pseudopuberty (eg, McCune-Albright syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In girls with hormonally active cysts, the ovarian enlargement may be mistaken for an ovarian tumor, leading to unnecessary oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a retrospective review of 1818 ultrasonographic studies in prepubertal girls, ovarian cysts were identified in 99 (5 percent); in 62 percent of cases, the cyst was an incidental finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The embryologic ovary migrates from the level of the 10<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebrae and descends to the true pelvis by puberty. Thus, in early life, the ovary is an abdominal organ and more susceptible to torsion (thought to be due to an elongated utero-ovarian ligament).</p><p>Chronic abdominal aching pain, either periumbilical or localized to a lower quadrant, may be present. Acute severe pain simulating appendicitis or peritonitis may result from torsion, perforation, infarction, or hemorrhage (into or from the ovarian mass). Alternatively, the child may complain of intermittent pain, presumably because of partial or intermittent torsion, which may resolve without therapy or act as a warning sign of impending torsion requiring emergency surgery. Torsion also causes nausea, vomiting, pallor, and leukocytosis (with left shift), often followed by less severe localized pain. Nonspecific symptoms suggestive of a large tumor include a sense of abdominal fullness or bloating and urinary frequency or retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the primary assessment tool. If torsion is suspected because of pain, the addition of Doppler ultrasound may be helpful. However, Doppler is not always conclusive since Doppler flow can be appreciated in a torsed ovary without complete cessation of blood flow, and, alternatively, Doppler flow can be absent in normal ovaries. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have also been used in an attempt to clarify equivocal findings; the value of these studies has not been established.</p><p>Children with recurrent, large, or multicystic ovarian masses and signs of early sexual development should be evaluated for precocious puberty (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>).

A follow-up ultrasound examination in four to eight weeks should be performed. If the cyst has not resolved and the ultrasonic characteristics are still reassuring, then continued observation is appropriate as long as the girl remains asymptomatic.</p><p>In a retrospective review of simple and complex cysts (greater than 5 cm in diameter) in 92 girls (average age 14.9 years), 23 were treated surgically either because of the initial ultrasonic appearance or persistence; 10 were found to have neoplasms (six teratomas, two cystadenomas, one granulosa cell tumor, one Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor). Among the 51 patients who were managed expectantly, eight were prepubertal; 90 percent of the cysts spontaneously resolved within approximately two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In the latter case, the child should be stabilized and then taken to surgery, which can usually be performed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. A hemoperitoneum is not a contraindication to laparoscopy. Free blood and clots are aspirated and hemostasis assured by fulguration of the areas of bleeding. Laparotomy is indicated if the surgeon is not experienced in laparoscopic procedures on children or if the patient is hypotensive and cannot be promptly stabilized.</p><p>In contrast, surgery is always indicated at the time of diagnosis of ovarian torsion because a torsed ovary can usually be salvaged. Untwisting can be accomplished laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37-39</a>]. It is unclear whether oophoropexy of the contralateral ovary should be performed to prevent torsion of the normal ovary. Oophoropexy can also be safely performed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

As an example, a series describing 102 girls aged 2 days to 20 years who underwent 106 consecutive separate ovarian operations found 42 percent (25 of 59) of those who presented with acute abdominal pain had ovarian torsion; the ovarian mass was malignant in only one of these girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Adolescent ovaries may contain multiple follicles in different stages of development. Most simple cysts result from failure of the maturing follicle to ovulate and involute.</p><p>Cysts in the postmenarcheal adolescent may be asymptomatic (and found incidentally), but can cause menstrual irregularities, pelvic pain, or, if large, urinary frequency, constipation, or pelvic heaviness. Rupture leads to intra-abdominal pain and bleeding, which can be minor or severe. Torsion also causes acute pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, pallor, and leukocytosis (with left shift), often followed by less severe localized pain. It is unclear why some nonruptured functional cysts cause symptoms and others do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of ovarian cysts in the adolescent patient is complex because of the functioning ovary, the onset of sexual activity, and the possibility of pregnancy.

Color Doppler velocimetry of adnexal masses is used to detect low peripheral resistance, which can result from neovascularization related to malignancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>).

Asymptomatic simple cysts &lt;6 cm on ultrasound examination can be observed with or without administration of oral contraceptive pills. Some clinicians administer oral contraceptives to suppress the ovarian-hypothalamic axis so new cysts will not form and possibly confuse the clinician as to whether the first cyst resolved and a new one developed or the original cyst persisted (starting an oral contraceptive pill does not facilitate resolution of the existing cyst). Modern low-dose oral contraceptive pills appear to have minimal efficacy in preventing development of functional cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The patient should be evaluated monthly by bimanual or ultrasound examination.</p><p>If a simple fluid-filled cyst persists, increases in size, is greater than 4 to 6 cm, or causes symptoms, then a laparoscopic cystectomy may be warranted. It is possible that cysts larger than 6 cm will regress spontaneously, and, thus, observation is the initial preferred option. If a cystectomy is performed, the cyst wall should be sent for pathologic examination. Ovarian cystectomy is preferred to cyst aspiration due to the high rate of recurrence after aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Asymptomatic simple cysts of 6 to 10 cm may also spontaneously resolve and can be safely observed. If the cyst recurs or operative intervention is needed, the procedure should be conservative and preserve as much ovarian tissue as possible. Patients incidentally found to have small follicular cysts at the time of surgery should not undergo cyst aspiration or cystectomy, as these cysts will resolve spontaneously; ovarian and peritubal adhesions may form from ovarian surgery and result in infertility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Corpus luteum cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corpus luteum cysts are also common. They result from the normal formation of a corpus luteum after ovulation and can reach 5 to 12 cm in diameter. The ultrasound appearance of these cysts is characterized by increased internal echoes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>). Bleeding into the cyst or rupture with intraperitoneal hemorrhage may occur.</p><p>In the absence of pain or intraperitoneal bleeding, observation for a time period between two weeks and three months and possibly therapy with oral contraceptive pills is appropriate. The oral contraceptive pills will keep a new cyst from forming so as to decrease confusion at the follow-up ultrasound but do not help the current cyst regress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most corpus luteal cysts will involute during the two-week to three-month observation period. There is no upper size limit for observation; even large corpus luteal cysts can be observed without the need for surgical intervention. Corpus luteum cysts are at increased risk of torsion due to increased ovarian size and weight. Even with hemorrhage or severe pain, observation is the first-line therapy. The cyst will usually resolve spontaneously, and the free intraperitoneal blood will be reabsorbed. Surgery is rarely needed.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Persistent/noninvoluting</span> ovarian cysts should be managed surgically with removal of the cyst and cyst wall and conservation of the ovary. Even large (greater than 10 cm) cysts can be managed with an ovarian cystectomy and conservation of the stretched-out normal ovarian cortex with preservation of normal ovarian tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARIAN NEOPLASMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian neoplasms (benign and malignant) account for approximately 1 percent of all tumors in children and adolescents. Most ovarian neoplasms are physiologic or benign; fewer than 5 percent of ovarian malignancies occur in this age group. However, ovarian enlargement, whether cystic or solid, in these patients must be evaluated to exclude malignancy because approximately 10 to 20 percent of all ovarian masses occurring during childhood and adolescence are malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41,47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,47-50</a>]. Approximately 35 to 45 percent of ovarian cancers in children are germ cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Any mass that does not resolve spontaneously (functional cyst) needs to be further evaluated to help determine if it is benign or malignant. On imaging, persistent ovarian masses can be simple (cystic) or complex (containing both solid and cystic areas). A persistent simple (cystic) ovarian mass is most likely a mucinous or serous cystadenoma. A persistent complex (solid and cystic) mass is most likely a germ cell tumor. The most common germ cell tumor in an adolescent is a teratoma. Teratomas can be benign (mature teratoma) or malignant (immature teratoma).</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in women &le;25 years of age, and germ cell is the most common histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Germ cell tumors make up one-half to two-thirds of ovarian neoplasms in girls up to 18 years of age compared with 20 percent of ovarian tumors in adult women.

The wide variety of symptoms caused by ovarian tumors suggests that abdominal palpation and rectal examination in the dorsal supine position are important in any girl with nonspecific abdominal or pelvic complaints. Nonspecific symptoms may be more common with epithelial than germ cell ovarian tumors.

If the tumor markers are abnormal and malignancy is suspected, then a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appropriate staging is performed. It is preferable to subject the patient to a second procedure after the final pathology specimens are reviewed than to perform an unnecessary ablative procedure.
