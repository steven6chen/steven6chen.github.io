The primary treatments are developmental and behavioral therapies, typically as part of Early Intervention or school-based programming. Psychopharmacologic interventions may be a useful adjunct to <span class=\"nowrap\">behavioral/environmental</span> interventions in children with ASD after behavioral and educational supports have been maximized including supports to improve the child's comprehension and ability to communicate.

In addition to a thorough medical assessment, formal behavioral analysis conducted by a behavior analyst or behavioral psychologist may be warranted to clarify the nature of the symptoms under consideration for treatment. Depending on regional systems and resources, this may be arranged through the child's educational team at school.</p><p>The potential benefits and risks of pharmacologic therapy for children with ASD must be weighed on a case-by-case basis. Parents and caregivers should be informed if the medication is being used off-label (only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aripiprazole</a> are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] specifically for irritability in children with ASD).</p><p>The principles for the psychopharmacologic management of individuals with ASD are the same as for individuals with other psychiatric conditions. Medications should be used to target specific symptoms that are clearly defined, and the symptoms should be measured over time (preferably using rating scales) to monitor treatment efficacy. It is also important to periodically re-evaluate the need for continued treatment.</p><p>Children with ASD are more sensitive to psychopharmacotherapy and more likely to have adverse effects than children without ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, given their weaknesses communicating and identifying their emotions, it can be difficult to determine the predominant target symptom (eg, anxiety, impulsivity, anger) and, therefore, the best psychopharmacologic agent. For similar reasons, it can be more challenging to monitor certain side effects of medications (eg, dry mouth, dizziness).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication may be warranted if the child's behavior interferes with his or her ability to access therapy and other contributing factors (eg, comorbid illness, <span class=\"nowrap\">psychosocial/environmental</span> stressors) have been addressed. However, determining which symptoms to target with medication can be challenging. Few of the various measures for assessing behavior in children (eg, Vanderbilt scales for attention) are standardized for children with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Behavior scales must be used in conjunction with appropriate clinical and historical data. Thorough clinical assessment, including information collection from multiple sources (eg, parents, therapists), may be necessary to identify the most relevant target behavior.</p><p>If available, Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) by the child's behavioral therapist can provide valuable information. FBA is a formal, systematic observation that includes identifying target behaviors, antecedents, and outcomes in order to better understand the function of the behavior. Understanding the function of the behavior helps the clinician to identify an appropriate target for medication. As an example, aggression may result from impulsivity, anxiety, irritability, or other psychiatric problem (eg, mood or psychotic disorder), which are treated with different psychopharmacologic agents.</p><p>If FBA is not available, the clinician should work to identify and characterize each target behavior (with input from parents, other caregivers, and school staff, if possible) in terms of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long has it been present?

However, access to such specialists is not always available.

Most of the existing evidence is extrapolated from studies on comorbid conditions (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, etc) in children without ASD. Studies of pharmacotherapy in children with ASD generally are small, retrospective, and nonblinded; they are hampered by the lack of diagnostic tools that have been standardized in the ASD population.

Medications should be started at lower doses, and doses should be increased more slowly than in patients without ASD.</p><p>The efficacy and adverse effects of pharmacologic agents should be monitored systematically during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In addition to clinical history, an appropriate tool should be used to monitor outcome if such a tool is available. Target symptoms of children receiving intensive behavioral interventions can be monitored using standardized instruments for specific symptoms (eg, attention rating scales) although these instruments have not been validated for use in individuals with ASD. In addition, many children with ASD have structured behavioral programming as a component of their educational and therapeutic program. The data collection techniques included in their behavioral programming can also be used for monitoring response to medications. For children who do not have this type of programming, the prescribing clinician can work with the child's family and school staff to develop of system for monitoring target symptoms and providing feedback about response to medications.

After successful control of the target symptom for 6 to 12 months, withdrawal of the medication for a period of time may be warranted to determine whether it is still necessary.</p><p>The parents and caregivers should be provided with information about the prescribed medication and its potential adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591288613\"><span class=\"h2\">Polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to consider additional precautions when prescribing more than one psychoactive medication for patients with ASD. Many medications used for treating maladaptive behavior or mood symptoms have sedative effects and taking more than one may result in excessive daytime sedation. In addition, some medications that share a metabolic pathway may either enhance or inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, requiring dosing adjustments. Finally, several medications can prolong QTc and may have additive effects on heart conduction when used simultaneously (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atomoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">citalopram</a>).

Sleep disturbance may be related to abnormalities in melatonin, serotonin, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p>The evaluation of sleep disturbance in children with ASD should include a thorough sleep history and screen for obstructive apnea and other sleep disorders. Referral to a specialist (eg, sleep specialist, neurologist, otolaryngologist) may be warranted if a specific sleep disorder is identified or suspected.

In a meta-analysis of five randomized crossover trials (including a total of 57 patients) of melatonin in children with ASD, melatonin increased sleep duration by 73 minutes and decreased sleep onset latency by 66 minutes compared with placebo, but did not affect night-time awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Side effects were minimal. In individual studies, the doses ranged from 0.75 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and the duration of treatment ranged from 14 days to 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/129,130,133-135\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130,133-135</a>].</p><p>These results suggest that in the short-term (ie, up to six months), 1 to 10 mg of melatonin may be effective in helping children with ASD to fall asleep and sleep longer when provided 30 minutes before bedtime. However, there are no dosing guidelines for administration and no information on long-term use or side effects. Side effects of melatonin may include difficulty waking, daytime sleepiness, and enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>].</p><p>We suggest melatonin for patients with ASD who have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep despite appropriate sleep hygiene and behavioral or environmental interventions. We usually start with 0.5 to 1 mg, depending upon age, and increase by 1 mg as needed to a maximum of 10 mg (although in clinical practice, others may use a higher dose).</p><p>Melatonin is sold over the counter and does not require a prescription. It is not regulated by the FDA.
