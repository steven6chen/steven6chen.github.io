Gluten is a protein that is found in wheat, rye, barley, and (sometimes) oats. Many foods, such as breads, pasta, pizza, cereals, and crackers, have gluten in them. People who are on a gluten-free diet should not eat any foods with gluten.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311492\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should be on a gluten-free diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a condition called celiac disease should be on a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease is a condition that affects the body's ability to break down certain foods. People with celiac disease get sick if they eat foods with gluten. They need to be on a strict gluten-free diet for their whole life.</p><p>If you think you have celiac disease, don't start a gluten-free diet until after you are tested for the disease. That's because what you eat can affect your test results.</p><p>More and more, though, people without celiac disease are eating a gluten-free diet. They might have heard that this diet can help them lose weight or feel better. It's true that a gluten-free diet can be healthy. But it also sometimes keeps people from getting all the nutrition they need. If you are thinking about being on a gluten-free diet, ask your doctor or nurse if it's a good choice for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311507\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I get started?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To get started, you will work with a dietitian (food expert) or other professional who has experience with a gluten-free diet. He or she will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach you which foods are fine to eat and which foods you should avoid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you plan balanced meals so that you get the nutrition you need</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you gluten-free recipes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you find gluten-free substitutes for your favorite foods (such as pasta or cookies)</p><p/><p>You can get advice and help from other people, too. Ask your doctor or nurse if there is a local support group for people with celiac disease. Or you can look at websites, such as <a href=\"http://www.celiac.org/&amp;token=nEewIP08Ktv0DdrkttzjcJJiBdkd4HzrpDc8nfUl0Zw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=86971\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.celiac.org</a>, <a href=\"http://www.celiac.com/&amp;token=nEewIP08Ktv0DdrkttzjcM3HOTYVvotnqDkbdt2k+oM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=86971\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.celiac.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.csaceliacs.org/&amp;token=MOSx24E6HB+txKpO0eF0Gibll+XkSqm6jSExEGo8WuuJzwXcHYdBgTlTOVATogmV&amp;TOPIC_ID=86971\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.csaceliacs.org</a>.</p><p>It can be hard to learn how to manage a gluten-free diet, especially at first. But it usually gets easier with practice and over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311522\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods can I eat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods that are gluten free and fine to eat include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54353 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rice, corn, potatoes, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and soybeans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special flours, pasta, and other products made from these foods and labeled &quot;gluten free&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruits and vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meat and eggs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wine and distilled alcoholic drinks, such as rum, tequila, vodka, and whiskey</p><p/><p>Milk, cheese, and other dairy foods are also gluten free. But many people with celiac disease have trouble digesting these foods, especially at first. Doctors usually recommend that people with celiac disease avoid eating dairy products, at least for a short time, while their intestines are healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311554\"><span class=\"h1\">Which foods should I not eat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You need to avoid all foods made from or with wheat, rye, and barley (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86922 \">table 2</a>). Ask your doctor or dietitian if you can eat oats.</p><p>Many types of foods contain or might contain gluten, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flour, breads, crackers, muffins, and baking mixes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pasta, pastries, and cereals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some sauces, spreads, spices, condiments, and salad dressings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Processed meats and meat substitutes (like vegetarian burgers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beers, ales, lagers, and malt vinegars</p><p/><p>To know exactly which foods you can eat, you will have to read ingredient labels. Foods that are labeled &quot;gluten free&quot; or say they are made or processed in a &quot;gluten-free facility&quot; are fine to eat. Foods that contain wheat are <strong>not</strong> fine to eat. If you are unsure whether a food is gluten free, call the company. Their phone number should be on the package.</p><p>Some medicines (both prescription and over-the-counter) and vitamin supplements contain a small amount of gluten. But you can still take most types of pills if you have celiac disease. Check with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311586\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need to take vitamins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might. Celiac disease can keep your digestive system from normally absorbing the nutrients in foods. To get all the nutrients you need, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you take a daily vitamin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311601\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I eat out?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Many restaurants now have gluten-free menus or foods. But always let the restaurant know you can't have gluten. That way, they can be extra careful when they cook your food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311616\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child is on a gluten-free diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is on a gluten-free diet, let his or her caregivers, teachers, and school know. Tell them which foods your child can and can't eat. If your child goes to school, you might want to leave a gluten-free treat with the nurse or teacher. That way, your child will have a safe treat when the class has a party.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64311631\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Celiac disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplements-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin supplements (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Celiac disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Celiac disease in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
