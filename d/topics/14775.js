Primary treatment is usually surgery or pharmacologic treatment. When initial treatment with these interventions fails, or when there is a recurrence, radiation therapy should be considered.</p><p>Current radiation therapy employs more sophisticated imaging and targeting techniques than were previously available, but most published papers, which are based on retrospective series, report results using older techniques. The newer techniques offer the promise of reducing the incidence and severity of side effects. The relatively long time required for control of hormonal hypersecretion and the subsequent development of hypopituitarism have limited more widespread use of radiation therapy. </p><p>The common forms of radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas and their efficacy and side effects will be discussed here.

It is most effective and safe when treating small sizes and when able to aim very accurately so that safety margins can be minimized and the total target size is as small as possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913928\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractionated radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractionated radiation therapy is the delivery of radiation therapy in multiple, small, daily doses, usually five days a week for five to six weeks. This is the most common way radiation therapy is delivered for most other indications of radiation treatment. </p><p>In deciding which form of radiation therapy should be employed for a particular pituitary adenoma, we consider these factors:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27505744\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment schedule considerations for pituitary adenomas include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convenience &ndash; SRS can be delivered as a single treatment, whereas fractionated radiation therapy requires 25 to 30 treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safety &ndash; Adenomas that are too close, 3 to 5 mm, to radiation-sensitive tissues, such as the optic chiasm or other parts of the optic pathway, are more safely treated with fractionated radiation therapy since a large, single dose of radiation to these tissues can cause blindness. Large adenomas, eg, 3 cm or greater in diameter, are also more safely treated with fractionated radiation because of the large volume of tissue receiving radiation. (See <a href=\"#H3433383\" class=\"local\">'Other damage'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic response &ndash; Some studies report that SRS results in a more rapid reduction in elevated hormone concentrations than fractionated radiation treatment. However, these were not randomized trials, and there were differences between the populations receiving the two types of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Because SRS can cause damage to the optic pathways, the patients treated by a single large dose had smaller adenomas than those treated by fractionated doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913935\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION DELIVERY SYSTEMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913943\"><span class=\"h2\">Gamma Knife</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gamma Knife is a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment unit that uses radioactive isotope cobalt-60 to deliver radiation. Much of the radiation treatment for pituitary adenomas was pioneered using Gamma Knife. The radioactive cobalt-60 is housed within the machine, which controls how the small beams of gamma rays, also known as photons, are directed. Patients are positioned within the unit with their head held in place by a metal frame. The machinery aims multiple tiny beams of radiation at the desired intracranial target. The greatest experience of SRS (single treatments) in the management of pituitary adenomas has been with Gamma Knife.</p><p>Treatments are typically limited to one visit because the head frame is attached with pins to the scalp that are minimally invasive but pierce the skin to fix on the skull. This localized trauma would not be considered appropriate to perform repeatedly, as it leaves a small wound mark at each pin site with each application. Dose delivery with a low energy source such as cobalt-60 requires a large dose gradient such that the dose delivered to the periphery of a target is approximately half the dose delivered to the geometric center of the target. There are over 200 angles arranged around the patient's head from which these small beams can be directed to the adenoma target. Not all beam sources are used. The choice of beams per target creates the conformal radiation treatment. Doses for each type of pituitary adenoma are described below and refer to the margin dose delivered to the target since this is the expected minimum therapeutic dose. The latest generation of this unit employs a noninvasive immobilization head frame, such that multiple fraction treatments are now feasible. (See <a href=\"#H50913971\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and suggested approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913950\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear accelerator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The linear accelerator is the most common device used to deliver radiation treatments, ie, it is the basic radiation therapy machine. It accelerates electrons to high speeds and then converts this energy to high-energy x-rays, also known as photons. Many technological modifications are used to deliver the radiation to the desired location and dose. Complex shapes can be treated, and the dose can be varied across the target. Terms that are sometimes used to denote types of fractionated radiation delivery using a linear accelerator include three-dimensional conformal therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. A term describing a single large dose delivered from a linear accelerator can be called single fraction SRS. Both fractionated radiation therapy and single fraction SRS are common uses of the linear accelerator. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913957\"><span class=\"h2\">CyberKnife</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CyberKnife can deliver either a single large dose or fractionated therapy. It is a small linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm. The arm has more freedom to move around patients than the radiation source in other delivery systems and, therefore, allows patients to be in less confining positions as the unit is able to more easily compensate for variations in the patient's daily position. Numerous small radiation beams are used to deliver the radiation to the desired location. The overall length of time of treatment on a CyberKnife is typically longer than with other radiation therapy modalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913964\"><span class=\"h2\">Proton therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proton therapy is delivery of high-energy proton particles most commonly generated by a cyclotron or synchrotron. Proton therapy results in less exposure of the surrounding normal tissue to an excess dose than do photon-based modalities. The decrease in the collateral unintended radiation exposure of normal tissues may decrease side effects from treatment. The number of proton therapy facilities has been scarce because of the complexity and capital cost of these centers but is increasing, with approximately 20 centers open in 2017 as compared with two centers in 2000.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913971\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY AND SUGGESTED APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relatively slow response of hypersecretion to radiation therapy, compared with surgery and even with pharmacologic treatment, is a disadvantage of this technique. Control of adenoma growth, however, is very high using all of the techniques.</p><p>There has been extensive experience with use of all forms of radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas, but individual published reports generally describe retrospective experiences using a single technique. As a consequence, it is difficult to compare the results of the various techniques, especially in controlling excessive secretion of pituitary hormones. The difficulty is compounded by the use of different radiation doses and different biochemical criteria for cure of hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The effect of adenoma size and concomitant pharmacologic treatment for hormonal hypersecretion on the response to Gamma Knife treatment has been reported in 418 patients with mixed types of pituitary adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], 40 patients with Cushing's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and 46 patients with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenoma size &ndash; Larger adenoma volume was associated with a lower rate of hormonal control in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and greater rate of new hormonal deficiencies in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but was not associated with a differential effect on adenoma size in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant pharmacologic treatment &ndash; Pharmacologic treatment (somatostatin analogs for acromegaly and dopamine agonists for lactotroph adenomas) at the time of irradiation was associated with lower rates of hormonal control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and a higher incidence of hypopituitarism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but no difference in control of adenoma size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These associations are difficult to interpret, however, because concomitant pharmacologic treatment of patients with Cushing's disease with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, which blocks cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands, ie, does not affect the pituitary gland, also reduces the hormonal efficacy of Gamma Knife treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This observation suggests that the more favorable effect of radiation when pharmacologic treatment has been withheld is related to another factor, eg, selection bias, and not to a direct effect of the drug on the pituitary adenoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50913979\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy is considered for clinically nonfunctioning adenomas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When residual adenoma remains after surgery. The rationale is that continued growth is approximately 30 to 60 percent at five years when obvious adenoma tissue, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), remains after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-of-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Radiation can be delivered in a single large dose (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) or multiple fractions (fractionated radiation therapy). (See <a href=\"#H50913897\" class=\"local\">'Types of radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy of any kind controls adenoma volume in 90 to 100 percent of patients. Radiation therapy may also reduce hormonal hypersecretion, but the effect is variable and slow; complete normalization occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients after 10 years. (See <a href=\"#H50913971\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy causes hypopituitarism in up to 80 percent of patients after 10 years but has very low risk of optic pathway and other long-term side effects. (See <a href=\"#H50914030\" class=\"local\">'Risks/adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest radiation therapy be administered to patients with pituitary adenomas only after surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical options have been exhausted (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H50914030\" class=\"local\">'Risks/adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest SRS for adenomas that are not close to the optic pathway (at least 3 to 5 mm away) and are smaller than 3 cm in diameter and fractionated radiation therapy for adenomas that are larger than 3 cm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> closer to the optic pathway (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H50914030\" class=\"local\">'Risks/adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For clinically <strong>nonfunctioning</strong> pituitary adenomas, we suggest either SRS or fractionated radiation therapy, depending upon the size and location of the adenoma. If SRS is chosen, we suggest a dose of 18 Gy (range 14 to 20 Gy) and no more than 8 to 10 Gy to the optic pathway. If fractionated radiation therapy is chosen, we suggest a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction and no more than 54 Gy to the optic pathway. The goal of therapy with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas is tumor growth control. (See <a href=\"#H50913979\" class=\"local\">'Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For clinically <strong>functioning</strong> (eg, secretory) pituitary adenomas, we suggest either SRS or fractionated radiation therapy, depending upon the size and location of the adenoma. If SRS is chosen, we suggest a dose of 20 Gy (range 20 to 25 Gy) and no more than 8 to 10 Gy to the optic pathway. If fractionated radiation therapy is chosen, we suggest a dose of 5 to 54 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction and no more than 54 Gy to the optic pathway. The goal of radiation therapy for functioning pituitary adenomas is both biochemical control, which typically requires higher radiation doses, and tumor growth control. (See <a href=\"#H99556046\" class=\"local\">'Clinically functioning pituitary adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking pharmacologic treatment to reduce hormonal secretion by the adenoma, eg, dopamine agonist or somatostatin analog, we suggest discontinuing it for one month prior to and one month following radiation treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H50913971\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients, we recommend counseling on the high risk of subsequent development of hypopituitarism and the importance of lifelong surveillance after treatment.
