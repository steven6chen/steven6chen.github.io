Although the exact developmental stage at which GCNIS arises is controversial, the 8th through 12th weeks of gestation are the focus of much attention. Two proteins, the c-kit receptor (KIT) and placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), are overexpressed by GCNIS cells; these and other markers are expressed by fetal germ cells only between the 8th and 12th week of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Androgen insensitivity syndromes and mixed gonadal dysgenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>The high incidence of testis cancer in men with cryptorchidism and other congenital errors of gonadal development points to intrauterine factors as playing an important role in the transformation of germ cells to GCNIS. During this period, which may be a crucial step in germ cell differentiation, either genetic factors (eg, gonadal dysgenesis) or environmental influences (eg, the estrogenic milieu) may lead germ cells to acquire malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The altered hormonal environment during puberty may cause GCNIS cells to begin to replicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Initially, GCNIS spreads longitudinally in a noninvasive fashion along the seminiferous tubules. Upon reaching the rete testis, GCNIS cells spread to other tubules. At some point following puberty, GCNIS becomes &quot;invasive&quot; (penetrating the basement membrane); however, invasion of the basement membrane is not synonymous with either seminomatous or nonseminomatous GCTs. The specific factors that lead to initiation and promotion of invasiveness have not been elucidated.</p><p>The GCNIS cell appears to be the precursor of all of the different phenotypic varieties of testicular GCTs, except spermatocytic seminomas in older adult men and yolk sac tumors and mature teratomas in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/14,16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,23</a>]. Morphologically, GCNIS cells resemble seminomas more closely than nonseminomatous GCT. While it was originally thought that the GCNIS cell progressively differentiated into seminoma, and then into a nonseminomatous GCT, most now believe that GCNIS can progress along two different pathways, either from seminoma to nonseminomatous GCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], or directly into a nonseminomatous GCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>].

Needle biopsy and aspiration are not an adequate substitute for an adequate biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The pathologic diagnosis of GCNIS is usually established on light microscopic examination of testicular tissue with or without immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Proper fixation of the biopsy specimen is crucial. Formalin may not be the best fixative for preservation of the cell morphology, but it is acceptable for the diagnosis of GCNIS. Although other fixatives including Bouin's or Stieve's solutions may provide better cell morphology, they may interfere with immunoreactivity of some markers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Histologic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the adult, testicular GCNIS is characterized histologically by proliferation of basilar malignant germ cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei, often one or two prominent nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50211 \">picture 1</a>). Sertoli cells are often displaced luminally. Affected seminiferous tubules almost always lack spermatogenesis and usually have thickened peritubular basement membranes. The interstitium may show hyperplasia of the Leydig cells. It is common for GCNIS to spread into the rete testis in a pagetoid fashion.</p><p>Although GCNIS can be diagnosed in the testes of prepubertal individuals, the histologic diagnosis can be challenging because GCNIS cells resemble normal infantile gonocytes. Thus, a negative biopsy performed before puberty does not exclude a subsequent risk of testicular cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunohistochemical staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemically, GCNIS cells share many characteristics of testicular GCT cells. Some of the markers seen in GCNIS can be found in invasive testicular GCTs; therefore, these markers can only be used to distinguish GCNIS from benign testicular conditions and not from other GCTs.</p><p>Placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is one of the most sensitive but least specific markers for GCNIS since this enzyme is detected in almost all kinds of neoplastic germ cells (GCNIS, seminoma, and non-seminomatous GCTs), but usually not in normal germ cells, except at the embryonal stage. About 97 percent of cases of GCNIS can be diagnosed with positive PLAP staining. (See <a href=\"#H458740744\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>Another useful diagnostic marker is OCT4 (octamer binding transcription factor 4, also called POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 or POU5F1). OCT4 is expressed in embryonic stem and germ cells and is involved in the initiation, maintenance, and differentiation of pluripotent and germline cells during normal development. In the adult testis, positive immunostaining for this marker is a strong indicator of the presence of GCNIS, seminomas (other than spermatocytic seminoma), or embryonal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Other types of GCTs, such as yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and mature and immature teratomas, do not show OCT4 immunoreactivity.</p><p>C-kit (CD117), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is a useful marker because its immunoreactivity can be seen in GCNIS and seminoma. Other nonseminomatous GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] or benign germ cells and sex stromal cells in the adult testis do not show the distinct membranous c-kit immunostaining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64019\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64019 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Other monoclonal antibodies, including M2A, <span class=\"nowrap\">43/9F,</span> and TRA-1-60, that recognize common epitopes shared by GCNIS and GCT have been reported as helpful stains for GCNIS with high sensitivities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].

These noninvasive tests are promising for diagnosis of GCNIS in the future, particularly as a diagnostic strategy in prepubertal boys and high-risk groups, but their clinical utility remains to be established.
