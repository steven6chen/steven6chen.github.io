The EPTS score is based upon candidate age, time on dialysis, absence or presence of diabetes, and history of prior solid organ transplant. The score is calculated for each candidate upon registration on the waiting list. The score is updated daily and any time the transplant hospital reports a change in any EPTS factor.</p><p>Twenty percent of kidneys that are estimated to function the longest are allocated to candidates that are expected to need the allograft for the longest time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26252320\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney donor profile index (KDPI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The KDPI is derived from the kidney donor risk index (KDRI) score and is the percentage of donors in a reference population that have a KDRI score less than or equal to the donor's KDRI score.</p><p>The KDRI estimates the relative risk of posttransplant graft failure and is calculated from the donor age, ethnicity, creatinine, history of hypertension or diabetes, cause of death, height, weight, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and whether the kidney was donated after circulatory death. The reference population is reviewed annually by the OPTN Kidney Transplantation Committee. The 15 percent of kidneys with the highest KDPI scores, estimated to have the shortest potential lifespan, are offered over a wider geographic area. It is expected that this feature will increase the utilization of donated kidneys and minimize differences in local transplant waiting times. The policy does not affect the decision process between the potential recipient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> transplant team; potential recipients may still turn down kidneys that are deemed unsuitable. Transplant programs must have informed consent from potential recipients in order to accept kidneys with a KDPI score &gt;85 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96282 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26252389\"><span class=\"h2\">Waiting time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidates are ranked both by score and by the date and time of registration on the waiting list.

The degree of sensitization is defined by the candidate's unacceptable antigens, reported at the time of listing. Unacceptable antigens are HLA antigens on a donor kidney to which a potential candidate has antibodies. Antibodies are determined using at least one solid-phase immunoassay (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or Luminex using purified HLA molecules) and expressed as the CPRA. Each candidate is assigned a CPRA score, which expresses the percentage of deceased donors in the donor pool expected to have one or more of the unacceptable antigens. The CPRA is derived from HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/allele</span> group and haplotype frequencies for the different <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups in proportion to their representation in the national deceased-donor population.</p><p>Each center may define the criteria for unacceptable antigens that are considered as contraindications for transplantation. It is the prerogative of the transplant center to establish criteria for additional unacceptable antigens, such as repeat transplant mismatches. A CPRA will be calculated automatically when the unacceptable antigens are listed or updated on the waiting list.</p><p>For candidates with CPRA &gt;99 or 100 percent, written approval of unacceptable antigens must be provided by the HLA laboratory director and the transplant physician and surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26252480\"><span class=\"h2\">Mandatory sharing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zero-mismatched kidneys and kidneys for candidates with CPRA &gt;99 percent must be shared nationally. A zero-antigen mismatch occurs when the patient and donor have zero nonequivalent HLA-A, B, and DR antigens and compatible blood types. Such kidneys are shared because allograft survival has been shown to be superior to all other match grades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26252120\"><span class=\"h2\">Double kidney allocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidneys from adult donors must be offered singly, unless the donor meets at least two of the following conditions and the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) would not otherwise use the kidneys singly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor age greater than 60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated donor creatinine clearance &lt;65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> based upon serum creatinine concentration upon admission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rising serum creatinine concentration (&gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> at time of retrieval</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of either longstanding hypertension or diabetes mellitus in the donor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerulosclerosis greater than 15 and less than 50 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26252187\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical urgency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No points are assigned to patients based upon medical urgency for national allocation of kidneys.
