The clinical presentation of this disorder spans a spectrum from asymptomatic but cosmetically troublesome small blue ectatic veins and varicosities, to severe fibrosing panniculitis, dermatitis, edema, and ulceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The final common pathway that leads to chronic venous insufficiency is the development of venous hypertension. In most cases, venous hypertension results from obstruction to venous flow, dysfunction of venous valves, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure of the &quot;venous pump.&quot; In these situations, flow is directed abnormally from the deep to the superficial system, producing local tissue inflammation fibrosis, and occasionally ulceration.</p><p>This topic will review normal venous anatomy and physiology, and the pathophysiology of venous hypertension with its clinical consequences. Other aspects of chronic venous insufficiency are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL VENOUS ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three major vascular pathways are responsible for draining blood away from the superficial vessels of the skin and subcutaneous fat and include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disorders#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders&quot;, section on 'Anatomy (The &quot;A&quot; component of CEAP)'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial veins &ndash; The superficial veins are a network of subcutaneous veins that are superficial to the deep muscular fascia and include the great saphenous and small saphenous veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52340 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep veins &ndash; The deep veins are located deep to the muscle fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219 \">figure 3</a>). Deep veins are either within the muscle (ie, intramuscular, such as the gastrocnemius and soleus) or between the muscles (ie, intermuscular); the latter are more important in the development of chronic venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The intermuscular veins, which accompany the lower extremity arteries, include the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal (fibular), popliteal, and femoral veins. The lower leg intermuscular veins are exposed to high subfascial pressures during calf muscle contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforating veins &ndash; The perforating veins communicate between the deep and superficial venous systems. One very important group of perforating veins, &quot;Cockett's perforators,&quot; connect the posterior tibial veins to the posterior accessory great saphenous vein (ie, vein of Leonardo), indirectly draining into the deep venous system. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of venous flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venous valves and &quot;venous pump&quot; are the two major determinants of venous flow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous valves are typically bicuspid. Venous valves direct flow from distal to proximal and from the superficial system to the deep system except in the foot, where flow is directed from the deep system to the superficial system. Venous valves increase in number in direct relation to the hydrostatic pressure; in the distal deep veins, for example, they may occur every 2 centimeters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The venous pump refers to the pumping effect of leg muscles on venous flow as described above (by increasing subfascial pressure above intramuscular vein hydrostatic pressure). As blood is directed proximally in the deep venous system by muscular contraction, it enters the deep venous system from the superficial system, draining the skin and subcutaneous tissues.</p><p/><p>The effectiveness of the pump is dependent upon the presence of adequate muscle contraction and competent venous valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Competent valves serve two main functions: they prevent the transmission of sudden rises in venous pressure in the superficial veins and capillaries during muscular contraction; and, at the end of muscle contraction, the valves prevent retrograde flow back into the superficial system. When this system is functioning appropriately, the ambulatory venous pressure in the superficial system is maintained between 20 and 30 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENESIS AND CONSEQUENCES OF CHRONIC VENOUS HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the presence of venous obstruction, incompetent venous valves, or inadequate muscle contraction, ambulatory venous pressures can reach 60 to 90 mmHg. This level of venous pressure constitutes venous hypertension, and is capable of initiating the anatomic, physiologic, and histologic changes associated with chronic venous insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80827 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valvular incompetence is the primary anatomic abnormality associated with venous hypertension. Deep vein thrombosis is an example of a disorder that causes venous hypertension (because of diminished proximal flow of venous blood) and chronic venous insufficiency via this mechanism. The increase in pressure is transmitted backward into the superficial venous system; thrombosis also destroys the valves, resulting in persistence of venous hypertension even if the thrombosed veins are recanalized. Chronic venous insufficiency is also associated with fewer valves per unit length which contributes to higher venous pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This process becomes a vicious cycle. As deep and superficial veins become distended with excess volume, anatomic distortion of the vessel wall produces further valvular incompetence.</p><p>The actual volume of refluxed blood in patients with venous insufficiency may be relatively small. However, when the superficial veins are already maximally distended, small increases in volume produce large increases in pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is the transmission of this excess pressure that is responsible for most of the skin changes characteristic of chronic venous insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lipodermatosclerosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standing is normally associated with reflex constriction of the precapillary arterioles; by diminishing the transmission of arterial pressure to the capillary bed, this response protects the capillary bed from surges in venous hydrostatic pressure when assuming an upright posture. Patients with venous hypertension may lose this reflex; as a result, large increases in venous pressure are transmitted directly to the superficial capillary system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sustained venous hypertension is associated with characteristic histological and ultrastructural changes that underlie the cutaneous manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency. </p><p>Venous hypertension is associated with changes in the venous wall, including variation in wall thickness, increases in type 1 collagen, decreases in type III collagen, degradation of extracellular matrix, and reductions in the number of smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These changes weaken the vessel wall and may lead to abnormal venous dilation, including tortuous (eg, telangiectasias, varicose veins) and nontortuous segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The chronic release of inflammatory mediators is a fundamental cause for the trophic skin changes associated with venous insufficiency. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytes accumulate and adhere to the endothelium of small vessels and become activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This microvascular leukocyte-trapping hypothesis is supported by histological findings of increased numbers of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and mast cells in the tissue of patients with chronic venous hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and other proteinases by the vessel cells breaks down the vascular extracellular matrix and leads to abnormal vascular permeability and edema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of proteolytic enzymes in subcutaneous tissues leads to the formation cutaneous ulcers, which heal poorly and can become chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migration of erythrocytes from the vascular space into tissue, and their subsequent degradation, results in the characteristic brown hyperpigmentation in the gaiter area.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lipodermatosclerosis presents as an area of indurated inflammatory tissue that binds the skin down to the subcutaneous tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65447%7EPC%2F76901%7EPC%2F73283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65447 graphicRef76901 graphicRef73283 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Lipodermatosclerosis is associated with abnormal, elongated, &quot;glomerular-like&quot; capillaries with increased vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Dermal fibrosis may be the result of TGF-&beta;1 fibrogenic cytokine release from activated leukocytes that have migrated out of the abnormally permeable vessels into the tissues. TGT-&beta;1 cytokine increases the production of collagen and subcutaneous fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Capillaries are virtually absent in areas of fibrotic scars, leading to a condition known as atrophie blanche (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112296\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112296 \">picture 2</a>) or livedoid vasculopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67105 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The lack of blood flow may explain the proclivity for these areas to develop ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=livedoid-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Livedoid vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with valvular incompetence, worsening lipodermatosclerosis may become part of a vicious cycle. As the fibrosis increases, it may become so extensive and constrictive as to girdle and strangle the lower leg, further impeding lymphatic and venous flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Low shear stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shear stress is inversely related to venous pressure. Thus, venous hypertension is associated with low shear stress. Low shear forces and mechanical stress activate endothelial cells, which in turn activate inflammatory cells and adhesion molecules. The end result is the release of cytokines, inflammatory modulators, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This persistent inflammatory response damages the venous wall and valves, resulting in venous hypertension, which perpetuates endothelial dysfunction and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-chronic-venous-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3060841\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic venous disease is a common medical problem that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The final common pathway that leads to chronic venous insufficiency is the development of venous hypertension, particularly within the deep venous system.

The intermuscular veins of the lower leg veins are exposed to high subfascial pressures during calf muscle contraction.
