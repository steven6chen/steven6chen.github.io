The majority of patients with SIBO present with bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea. This topic will review the management of SIBO. The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of SIBO are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H922218135\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy for SIBO are antibiotics to reduce (rather than eradicate) small intestinal bacteria. In addition, some patients require treatment of underlying nutritional deficiencies and associated <span class=\"nowrap\">ileitis/colitis</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy is typically begun on an empiric basis. The selection of antimicrobial regimens is based on the pattern of bacterial overgrowth, the prevalence of risk factors for drug-resistance (recent or repeated prior exposure), relevant antibiotic allergies, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is unnecessary to repeat breath testing if symptoms resolve with treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3664634802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate breath test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrogen-predominant bacterial overgrowth </strong>&mdash; In patients with hydrogen predominant bacterial overgrowth without excess methane production, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> (1650 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 14 days). Rifaximin is nonabsorbable rifamycin derivative. It is well tolerated and has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. However, the high cost of rifaximin has limited its use. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Methane-predominant bacterial overgrowth </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>In patients with methane-predominant bacterial overgrowth, we use a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> 500 mg twice daily and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> 550 mg three times daily for 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p>Alternative antibiotic regimens for the treatment of SIBO are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F107297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107297 \">table 1</a>). There are few randomized trials of antibiotics to treat bacterial overgrowth and the evidence for use of specific antibiotics is largely from observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. Studies suggest that clinical response rates may be higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> as compared with other antibiotics. In a randomized controlled trial in which 142 patients with SIBO were randomized to seven days of rifaximin (1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> glucose breath test normalization rates at one month were significantly higher in patients treated with rifaximin compared with metronidazole (63 versus 44 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153040933\"><span class=\"h2\">Correction of micronutrient deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficiencies of vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins, iron, thiamine, and niacin can be associated with severe SIBO and should be corrected when present.

However, severe cases require treatment that is the same as for patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The management of Crohn disease is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2284992923\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT RESPONSE AND RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 40 percent of patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) have persistent symptoms after initial antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recurrent SIBO is also frequent after antibiotic treatment. In a study involving 80 patients with SIBO, recurrence rates three, six, and nine months after successful treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> were 13, 28, and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recurrence was more likely in older adults, those with a history of an appendectomy, and with chronic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3896841013\"><span class=\"h1\">INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO INITIAL THERAPY OR RECURRENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4128173248\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We empirically treat patients with a second course of antibiotics if they have continued symptoms or early recurrence (&lt;3 months). For patients with recurrent symptoms &ge;3 months after initial antibiotic treatment, we perform a repeat breath test to diagnose SIBO. Patients with no improvement in symptoms after two courses of antibiotic therapy or progressive symptoms should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4229245687\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent antibiotic regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with partial response to recurrent SIBO, the choice of antibiotic therapy should be guided by the patient's initial treatment regimen. Antibiotics included in the initial regimen should generally be avoided. However, patients with an inadequate initial response or recurrent SIBO after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> can be retreated with a two-week course of rifaximin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Alternative antibiotic regimens are also summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F107297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107297 \">table 1</a>). Compliance with antibiotic therapy should be reinforced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3161411024\"><span class=\"h2\">Elemental diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We reserve the use of an elemental diet to patients who cannot tolerate antibiotics or have failed to respond to antibiotic therapy for SIBO. Limited observational data suggest that an elemental diet can induce remission of symptoms in patients with SIBO. However, elemental diets are expensive and compliance is limited by palatability. In a retrospective study, 124 patients with methane- or hydrogen-predominant SIBO were treated exclusively with elemental diet for at least two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients continued the diet for a total of three weeks if the breath test did not normalize by week two. At two weeks, 74 of 93 patients (80 percent) had a normal breath test. Five of 19 subjects who were treated with an elemental diet for an additional week had a normal breath test by day 22 for a cumulative response of 85 percent. Patients who normalized their breath test had a significant improvement in symptoms as compared with those with persistently abnormal breath tests (66 versus 12 percent). Fourteen patients discontinued the elemental diet and were excluded from the analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830639388\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393248297\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat the underlying etiology in all patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should receive therapy directed against the underlying etiology of SIBO (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81285\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81285 \">table 2</a>). As examples, medications that can decrease intestinal motility (eg, narcotics, benzodiazepines) or cause achlorhydria should be avoided when possible. Prokinetics are a useful adjunct in patients with SIBO due to an underlying dysmotility. In the case of iatrogenic surgical causes of SIBO and for fistulas between the proximal and distal intestine, surgery may be necessary in patients who fail to respond to antibiotics and have significant weight loss and diarrhea. Patients with dilated segments of bowel with poor motility may benefit from intestinal tapering procedures.

In such patients we administer antibiotics on a periodic basis (5 to 10 days out of every month or every other week). Antibiotics are changed to prevent the development of resistance to a specific drug. The frequency with which antibiotics are rotated varies from monthly to every six months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120816420\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions with unclear role</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low FODMAP diet</strong> &mdash; Fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed and are osmotically active in the intestinal lumen where they are rapidly fermented by small intestinal bacteria. A diet low in FODMAPs improves bloating and gas in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, however, evidence to support a low FODMAP diet in the prevention or management of patients with SIBO are lacking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Probiotics </strong>&mdash; There are limited data to support probiotics in the treatment of SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/10,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-17</a>]. In a 2017 meta-analysis that included 18 studies there was no significant difference in the incidence of SIBO in patients on probiotics as compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with SIBO who were treated with probiotics had higher rates of gut decontamination and decrease in breath hydrogen concentration and abdominal pain but there was no significant improvement in diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Statins</strong> &mdash; Statins have been shown to inhibit growth and production of methane in several Methanobrevibacter isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
