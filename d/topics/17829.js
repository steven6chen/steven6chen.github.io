This group has generally been divided into Langerhans cell histiocytosis and non-Langerhans histiocytosis. LCH is so named because the morphology and immunophenotype of the abnormal cells is similar to that of Langerhans cells, which are specialized dendritic cells found in the skin and mucosa. Gene expression array data on the dendritic cells from LCH have shown a unique profile distinct from the skin Langerhans cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Further evaluation of the pathologic dendritic cells in blood and bone marrow has proven that LCH is caused by myeloid dendritic cells with activation of the RAS pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is known that myeloid dendritic cells can express the same antigens (CD1a, CD207) as the skin Langerhans cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The non-Langerhans histiocytoses are thought to be derived from other dendritic cells that ultimately produce the monocyte-macrophage lineage.</p><p>For now, &quot;Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot; remains the preferred nomenclature, although new terminology may evolve when the precise origin of the CD-207+ cells in LCH is fully understood. The historical terms histiocytosis-X, Letterer-Siwe disease, Hand-Sch&uuml;ller-Christian disease, and diffuse reticuloendotheliosis should be abandoned. The term &quot;eosinophilic granuloma&quot; is sometimes used to describe the pathology of an individual lesion, particularly isolated lytic processes in bone.</p><p>The management of LCH in children and adults will be presented here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of LCH are presented separately, as is additional detail regarding solitary LCH involving either the lung or bone.

The evaluation should pay particular attention to signs or symptoms that may reflect involvement of the central nervous system (eg, excessive thirst and urination, abnormal growth velocity, abnormal findings on neurologic exam) or risk organs (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, symptoms due to cytopenias). </p><p>In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathologic diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) should be confirmed by biopsy of involved tissue prior to initiating treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis#H452648918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies for all patients include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, total protein, albumin, quantitative immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, uric acid, and urinalysis. Patients with hepatomegaly, jaundice, abnormal liver enzymes, or a low total protein or albumin should also be evaluated with a prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). A water restriction test should be performed if diabetes insipidus is suspected.

A sensitive quantitative PCR test can identify this mutation in biopsies when the number of pathologic cells is below 5 percent (the limit of standard DNA sequencing techniques), as well as identify circulating cells with this mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographic evaluation should include a skeletal survey, skull series, positron emission tomography (PET) or bone scan, and chest radiograph for all patients.

Additional radiographic testing depends upon patient characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is used to further assess involvement of the orbit, mastoid, vertebrae, or pelvis suspected based upon initial radiographic studies or symptoms.

At the time of diagnosis, patients are risk stratified based upon the extent of disease and whether or not &quot;risk&quot; organs are involved (ie, bone marrow, liver, or spleen). The risk stratification schemas used to determine treatment in prospective studies have changed over the years and continue to evolve. </p><p>Using information from the pretreatment evaluation, we stratify patients into three groups that help guide therapy: single system LCH, low-risk multisystem LCH, and multisystem LCH with risk organ involvement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single system LCH &ndash; Patients typically do not have systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss or fever). Unifocal or multifocal involvement can be found in one of the following <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems:</span> bone, skin, lymph node (excluding draining lymph node of another LCH lesion), lungs, central nervous system, or other rare locations (eg, thyroid, thymus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multisystem LCH &ndash; Two or more <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems</span> are involved with or without involvement of &quot;risk organs&quot;. Risk organs include the bone marrow, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen and denote a worse prognosis. Although the lung has been considered a &quot;risk organ&quot;, subsequent studies suggested that it has less of an effect on prognosis than other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In contrast to the term &quot;risk organs&quot;, the term &quot;CNS-risk&quot; areas include the mastoid, sphenoid, orbital, ethmoid, or temporal bones and denote an increased risk of involvement of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>This stratification is based upon data gathered from studies of patients with multisystem disease. An initial risk stratification scheme was suggested based upon data from the LCH-I randomized study that demonstrated similar patient outcomes in patients with multisystem disease after treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study, a &quot;low risk&quot; population was identified that had significantly better survival. These patients were age two years or older and had no evidence of LCH in the lung, bone marrow, liver, or spleen. The subsequent LCH-II study determined that age at diagnosis was not an independent prognostic factor, but confirmed that involvement of the lung, bone marrow, liver, or spleen resulted in significant disease-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Since these publications, the prognostic value of lung involvement has been questioned. Pulmonary involvement does not affect the outcome of patients with otherwise low risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H932497\" class=\"local\">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Although assay of circulating BRAF V600E mutated cells is not currently part of risk stratification, two studies have shown that this finding correlates with high-risk clinical characteristics, a higher risk of relapse, and more extensive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6814315\"><span class=\"h3\">Single system disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data to guide the management of patients with unifocal or multifocal involvement of one organ or system (eg, skin, lymph nodes, bone). The choice of therapy is generally made based upon the site of involvement and number of lesions with an aim to minimize toxicity. Treatment options include single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and prednisone, curettage of bone lesions, and topical therapy for skin lesions. Alternatively, a subset of patients may select close observation with treatment upon progression. None of these management options has been directly compared in prospective trials in this patient population.</p><p>The following is a description of common single system disease presentations and available therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single skull lesions in the frontal, occipital, or parietal bones (non-CNS-risk) and other single bone lesions &ndash; Children with a single non-CNS-risk skull lesion have a low recurrence rate (4 to 10 percent) following curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Intralesional injection of glucocorticoids at the time of biopsy may help control pain and improve range of motion in children with solitary lesions in the axial or appendicular skeleton. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma) of bone in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Solitary bone lesions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single skull lesions of the orbit, mastoid, temporal, or sphenoid bones (CNS-risk) &ndash; Patients with lesions in these bones are at increased risk of developing LCH involvement of the pituitary or brain with resultant endocrine abnormalities (eg, diabetes insipidus), morbidity, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. More intensive therapy is given in an attempt to prevent this progression. As such, these patients are generally treated with a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> such as that used for low risk multisystem disease, as described in the following section.

Such lesions often require intervention for stabilization and may benefit from radiation therapy. Management of these lesions is described in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H6872801\" class=\"local\">'Bone lesions at risk of collapse'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node &ndash; If a single lymph node with LCH is surgically removed, observation until progression is reasonable. If there are two or more nodes involved or if there are additional sites of disease, patients are usually treated with 12 months of chemotherapy as given for multisystem disease. (See <a href=\"#H42641532\" class=\"local\">'Multisystem disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary lesions &ndash; Pulmonary LCH is most commonly seen in adult smokers. The initial therapy for patients with pulmonary LCH is cessation of smoking. The management of pulmonary LCH is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin-only &ndash; Patients must have a thorough evaluation to determine if other sites of disease are present. A subset of patients will have spontaneous regression of cutaneous LCH (ie, &quot;self-healing cutaneous LCH&quot;), but this can only be identified retrospectively. Thus, close observation is an option for patients with skin-only disease. However, a significant percentage (up to 40 percent of infants) have been reported to progress to multisystem involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. For symptomatic patients with skin-only LCH, we commonly administer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) and, if needed, add 6-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mercaptopurine</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily), with dose adjustments made to avoid severe myelosuppression. We have found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> with or without oral methotrexate is effective for treating skin involvement in LCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Small retrospective studies and case reports have described responses to topical corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical nitrogen mustard</a>, oral methotrexate, and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of 14 patients with cutaneous LCH treated with topical nitrogen mustard reported responses in 13 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although eight patients achieved a complete response after a median of 12.3 months, six ultimately relapsed.</p><p/><p>All patients with single system disease are at risk for both local and distant recurrence. As such, these patients should be watched carefully for evidence of disease in other organs.

For patients who are not candidates for a clinical trial or for those who choose not to participate in a clinical trial, we suggest an initial six-week induction (or &quot;intensive&quot;) chemotherapy phase with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>. Subsequent therapy is dependent upon disease response at six weeks and whether &quot;risk organs&quot; (ie, hematopoietic system, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen) were involved at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83046\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83046 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with an adequate response proceed with &quot;continuation&quot; chemotherapy until a total treatment duration of 12 months is completed. &quot;Continuation&quot; chemotherapy consists of vinblastine and prednisolone with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mercaptopurine</a> added for patients with risk organ involvement. Patients without an adequate response undergo a second induction phase or proceed to second-line chemotherapy regimens. </p><p>This approach is based upon the results of prospective trials conducted by the Histiocyte Society, described in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H932497\"><span class=\"h4\">Induction chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial induction chemotherapy (sometimes called &quot;intensive&quot; chemotherapy) is given to all patients with the goal of achieving complete resolution of signs and symptoms. The LCH-III study, described below, found that 66 percent of patients with &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement and 86 percent of patients without &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement will demonstrate a response to therapy by six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The most common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> are constipation, mild cytopenias, and, rarely, alopecia. All patients should be carefully monitored for peripheral neuropathy, which is more common in teenagers and adults than in younger children. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> causes excessive appetite and weight gain in nearly all patients, mood changes, and sometimes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and myalgias.

Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and etoposide appear to be equally effective single agents, the combination of vinblastine plus prednisolone has been generally adopted due to concerns of secondary leukemia after etoposide exposure. </p><p>Experience from the author&rsquo;s institution suggests that single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (100 to 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose</span> daily over three to five days every three to four weeks) is an acceptable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The following is a summary of the largest organized prospective trials in LCH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DAL-HX 83 trial &ndash; In this nonrandomized trial, 28 patients with multifocal bone disease and 57 patients with soft tissue involvement but without organ dysfunction received an initial six-week treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, followed by one year of vinblastine, prednisone, and 6-<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mercaptopurine</a> (with etoposide added for patients with soft tissue involvement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the time of diagnosis, patients are risk stratified based upon the extent of disease and whether or not &quot;risk organs&quot; are involved. Patients with single system LCH are those with unifocal or multifocal involvement of one <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/system</span> (eg, bone, skin, lymph node, soft tissue). Patients with multisystem LCH are those with two or more <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems</span> involved with or without involvement of &quot;risk organs&quot;. &quot;Risk organs&quot; include the hematopoietic system, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen and denote a worse prognosis. In contrast, the term &quot;CNS-risk&quot; areas include the sphenoid, orbital, ethmoid, or temporal bones and denote an increased risk of involvement of the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H42641525\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with single system LCH, the choice of therapy is generally made based upon the site of involvement and number of lesions with an aim to minimize toxicity. Treatment options include single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and prednisone, curettage of bone lesions, and topical therapy for skin lesions. Alternatively, a subset of patients may select close observation with treatment upon progression. (See <a href=\"#H6814315\" class=\"local\">'Single system disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with multisystem LCH should be encouraged to participate in a clinical trial. For patients who are not candidates for a clinical trial or for those who choose not to participate in a clinical trial, we suggest initial induction chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Subsequent therapy is dependent upon disease response at six weeks and whether &quot;risk organs&quot; (ie, hematopoietic system, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen) were involved at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83046\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83046 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H932497\" class=\"local\">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H932504\" class=\"local\">'Response evaluation and selection of subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients who achieve no evidence of active disease after initial induction chemotherapy, we recommend the use of continuation chemotherapy, regardless of the &quot;risk organ&quot; status at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Continuation therapy is an essential part of the management of these patients and decreases the risk of relapse. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> for a total treatment duration of 12 months. Daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mercaptopurine</a> is added to continuation for patients with &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement when treated with vinblastine and prednisolone. (See <a href=\"#H932511\" class=\"local\">'Continuation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with evident but incomplete response after six weeks of induction chemotherapy who did not have &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement at diagnosis, we suggest proceeding to continuation therapy rather than a second induction course (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement at diagnosis, we suggest another six-week induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> only given for three days each week rather than proceeding with continuation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H932497\" class=\"local\">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stable disease who did not have &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement at diagnosis, we suggest another six-week induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> only given for three days each week rather than second-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with &quot;risk organ&quot; involvement who have unresponsive disease after six weeks of induction, we suggest the use of second-line treatment rather than another six-week induction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H932497\" class=\"local\">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6873611\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed or refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with progressive disease at six weeks should be changed to a second-line therapy, regardless of &quot;risk organ&quot; status at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6873611\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed or refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general treatment principles described above apply to most disease presentations of LCH in children. However, involvement of certain organs (eg, central nervous system, lungs, or bones at risk of collapse) has unique therapeutic implications. Importantly, adults with LCH require special consideration because toxicity rates are unacceptably high when these patients are treated with regimens usually offered to children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the completion of therapy, patients must be seen periodically to monitor for disease recurrence and late effects. (See <a href=\"#H6872130\" class=\"local\">'Post-treatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with relapsed or refractory LCH should be encouraged to enroll onto a clinical trial. Outside of a clinical trial, the treatment approach should be individualized based upon the patient&rsquo;s performance status, the timing of relapse, and the disease risk stratification. (See <a href=\"#H6873611\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed or refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1738746179\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Laurence A Boxer, MD, who passed away in January 2017.
