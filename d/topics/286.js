It has also been referred to as fulminant hepatic failure, acute hepatic necrosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatitis. Untreated, the prognosis is poor, so timely recognition and management of patients with acute liver failure is crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whenever possible, patients with acute liver failure should be managed in an intensive care unit at a facility capable of performing liver transplantation.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acute liver failure in adults. The prognosis and management of patients with acute liver failure is discussed separately.

While the time course that differentiates acute liver failure from chronic liver failure varies between reports, a commonly used cutoff is an illness duration of &lt;26 weeks. </p><p>Acute liver failure may also be diagnosed in patients with previously undiagnosed Wilson disease, vertically acquired hepatitis B virus, or autoimmune hepatitis, in whom underlying cirrhosis may be present, provided the disease has been recognized for &lt;26 weeks. On the other hand, patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis, even if recognized for &lt;26 weeks, are considered to have acute-on-chronic liver failure since most have a long history of heavy drinking. The approach to such patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute liver failure can be subcategorized based upon how long the patient has been ill and various cutoffs have been used. We classify acute liver failure as hyperacute (&lt;7 days), acute (7 to 21 days), or subacute (&gt;21 days and &lt;26 weeks). In patients with hyperacute or acute liver failure, cerebral edema is common, whereas it is rare in subacute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On the other hand, renal failure and portal hypertension are more frequently observed in patients with subacute liver failure. These subcategories have been associated with prognosis, but the associations reflect the underlying causes, which are the true determinants of prognosis. As an example, patients with hyperacute liver failure tend to have a better prognosis than those with subacute liver failure. The better prognosis is related to the fact that these patients often have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity or ischemic hepatopathy, diagnoses associated with a better prognosis than many of the disorders that may result in subacute liver failure, such as Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute liver failure can result from a wide variety of causes, including (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67925\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67925 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79913 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiosyncratic drug reactions </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral hepatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic hepatitis (in which case it is considered to be acute-on-chronic liver failure) (see <a href=\"#H73465368\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune hepatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic hepatopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Budd-Chiari syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Veno-occlusive disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fatty liver of <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/HELLP</span> (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant infiltration (most often breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, or myeloma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial hepatectomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxin exposure, including mushroom poisoning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (primarily a disorder of children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p>Viral and drug-induced hepatitis are the most common causes of acute liver failure in adults.

In addition, acute liver failure can be seen with herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p>Acute liver failure is estimated to develop in 0.35 percent of patients with hepatitis A and in 0.1 to 0.5 percent of patients with acute hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the incidence of acute liver failure from hepatitis B may be underestimated. Precore or pre-S mutant hepatitis B viruses that are able to produce infection but do not produce hepatitis B e antigen (precore mutants) or surface antigen (pre-S mutants) may be difficult to diagnose by routine serology. Thus, liver failure in such patients may be erroneously attributed to cryptogenic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was illustrated in a study in which evidence of hepatitis B infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 6 of 17 patients (35 percent) who underwent liver transplantation for what was initially thought to be non-A, non-B hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In a study of 109 patients with acute hepatitis C, acute liver failure developed in 11 (10 percent), 9 of whom had concurrent hepatitis B infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A patient may either acquire both viruses at the same time (coinfection) or acquire hepatitis D in the setting of preexisting chronic hepatitis B (superinfection). The risk of acute liver failure appears to be higher among patients who are coinfected than in those with hepatitis D superinfection or with acute hepatitis B alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hepatitis E virus is a significant cause of liver failure in countries where it is endemic, such as Russia, Pakistan, Mexico, and India. Overall, the case-fatality rate for hepatitis E is 0.5 to 3 percent. However, among women who are pregnant, the mortality rate increases to 15 to 25 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-e-virus-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis E virus infection&quot;, section on 'Acute hepatitis E'</a>.) </p><p>Acute liver failure is a rare complication of HSV infection. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been implicated as etiologic agents. Those at risk include neonates, patients taking steroids, HIV-infected patients, those with cancer or myelodysplastic syndromes, and pregnant women. HSV hepatitis has also been reported as an early cause of death after liver transplantation with concomitant lung and gastrointestinal involvement. HSV-related hepatitis has also been reported rarely in immunocompetent hosts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals with advanced disease, are at increased risk for developing complicated herpes zoster infections including acute liver failure. Hepatic involvement may occasionally develop in the absence of coincident rash.

In addition, some patients unknowingly take large amounts of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> when multiple acetaminophen-containing medications are taken together or if acetaminophen-containing medications are not taken as directed (a &quot;therapeutic misadventure&quot;). Acute liver failure can also result from normally therapeutic doses in patients who have underlying liver disease (particularly with ongoing alcohol use, which induces the cytochrome P450 system) or who are taking medications known to induce the cytochrome P450 system (particularly CYP2E1), such as anticonvulsants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68213\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68213 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Other toxins associated with acute liver failure include mushroom poisoning (most often <em>Amanita phalloides</em>) and carbon tetrachloride.

However, if the patient has progressed to the point of requiring liver transplantation, histologic evaluation can instead be performed on the explanted liver.

Patients with severe acute hepatitis have jaundice and coagulopathy but lack signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Distinguishing the two is important because patients with severe acute hepatitis generally have a good prognosis, whereas those who progress to acute liver failure have a high mortality rate and often require liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Differentiating severe acute hepatitis from acute liver failure in a patient with Wilson disease may be difficult because neurologic Wilson disease may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy. Features that suggest neurologic Wilson disease rather than hepatic encephalopathy include the presence of dysarthria, dystonia, tremors, or parkinsonism. In addition, neurologic symptoms in a patient with Wilson disease may have been present prior to the onset of the hepatic manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H69501597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Neurologic manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis may present with liver failure that appears to have developed over the course of weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, patients with alcoholic hepatitis typically have a history of heavy drinking for many years and are thus thought to have acute-on-chronic liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Differentiating alcoholic hepatitis from acute liver failure is important because the two entities are managed differently (eg, there is a role for corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, but not in acute liver failure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alcoholic hepatitis should be considered in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use or who have an aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio of approximately 2:1. However, a history of heavy alcohol use does not exclude other causes of acute liver failure (and in the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> toxicity may predispose to it), so a patient presenting with acute liver failure in the setting of heavy alcohol use still requires a thorough evaluation.
