In early 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States asked manufacturers of a number of antidepressants to make labeling changes to include a warning about a possible increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior, particularly at the initiation of therapy or at the time of dose changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After further analysis, in October 2004, the FDA directed manufacturers of all antidepressants (including tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) to include a warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Establishing the causal association is difficult because of the clear associations between severe depression and suicide and between severe depression and the need for antidepressant therapy. Because suicide is uncommon, it also is difficult to demonstrate the negative, which is that antidepressants do not cause suicide. Risk factors for suicidal behavior in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Psychiatric disorder'</a>.)</p><p>This topic discusses the evidence regarding antidepressants and the risk of suicide in children and adolescents. The use of antidepressants in adolescent depression is discussed separately, as is the association between antidepressants and suicide risk in adults.

Each of these study designs has limitations in demonstrating a causal association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicide is rare in randomized, controlled trials of antidepressants. Thus, individual trials typically lack the power to detect a relationship between antidepressants and suicidal ideation or behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies can more easily detect rare events such as suicide. However, causality is difficult to establish because of the association between severe depression and the use of antidepressants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Population-based studies have examined rates of antidepressant use and suicide over time. These studies have generally found lower rates of suicide with increasing rates of antidepressant use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Accordingly, the consensus has been that increases in prescribing likely yield lower rates of suicide. However, rare antidepressant-induced suicides could be masked by secular trends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, the use of newer antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may be a marker for better overall quality of health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, it is not clear that increased rates of antidepressant prescribing are the cause of decreasing rates of suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Randomized trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials of antidepressants in children and adolescents were not designed to determine whether these medications increase suicidal behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most of the trials excluded subjects with suicidal ideation and did not have enough power to detect rare adverse events such as suicide. Suicidal events were not methodically assessed as prespecified outcomes; rather, the events were spontaneously reported as adverse events and were not uniformly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, patients assigned to treatment with active drug often have more side effects, which may have led to increased contact with study personnel and a greater opportunity to report suicidal ideation and behavior (ascertainment bias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most of the reported suicidal events were suicidal thoughts, rather than actual suicidal behavior.</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials, subject to the limitations described above, have yielded different conclusions about the association between antidepressants and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, as illustrated below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened an advisory panel to reexamine analyses of published and unpublished data regarding suicidal thoughts and behaviors and antidepressants in children and adolescents. The advisory panel's combined analysis of 24 short-term (4 to 16 weeks), placebo-controlled trials of nine antidepressant medications in more than 4400 children and adolescents being treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders yielded the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>78 patients (2 percent) experienced adverse events representing suicidal ideation or behavior, collectively termed suicidality; adverse events are reports made by the research clinician if a patient or parent spontaneously shares thoughts about suicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the adverse events that were reported, patients on antidepressant medication had an increased risk of suicidality during the first few months of treatment compared with those on placebo (4 versus 2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In 17 of 23 studies, standardized forms were used to ask each patient about suicidality at each visit.

Over the course of treatment, all studies combined showed a slight reduction in suicidality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No completed suicides occurred during any of the studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FDA advisory panel concluded that there is a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in children taking antidepressants compared with placebo (risk ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Similar results were found in a 2007 meta-analysis that included seven studies not examined by the FDA when using a fixed-effects model (which assumes homogeneity across studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, using a random effects model, the 2007 meta-analysis found only a 0.7 percent increase in the risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in children taking antidepressants, a difference that was not statistically significant. The ratio of patients who responded to an antidepressant compared to those who experienced a suicidal event was around 11:1. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 17 trials (3229 children and adolescents) compared antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>) with placebo and found that suicidal ideation or behavior occurred in more patients who received antidepressants (RR=1.58, 95% CI 1.02-2.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

TADS compared the short-term (12-week) efficacy of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> (an SSRI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), fluoxetine plus CBT, and pill placebo in 439 adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The second phase of TADS compared the long-term (36-week) safety and effectiveness of the three active treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Patients at high risk for suicide (suicide attempt requiring medical attention within six months, clear intent or active plan to commit suicide, or suicidal ideation with a family unable to guarantee safety) were excluded. However, approximately 30 percent of patients had some evidence of suicidality at entry (as measured by the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Junior High School Version [SIQ-Jr], on which a score of &ge;31 indicates a level of suicidality requiring prompt clinical attentions).</p><p>After 12 weeks of therapy, patients in all four groups had a significant decrease in suicidal thinking from baseline (from adjusted mean total score of 20 to 30 to an adjusted mean total score of 11 to 15, depending upon the treatment group). The proportion of patients with scores &ge;31 (indicating a level of suicidality requiring prompt attention) decreased from 30 percent at baseline to 10 percent after 12 weeks of therapy. Improvement in suicidal thinking was greatest for patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> with CBT and least for those receiving fluoxetine alone, suggesting that CBT is protective against suicidal thinking. Treatment with fluoxetine did not appear to increase suicidal thinking.</p><p>Among the 439 subjects in the acute-phase of TADS, 24 (5.5 percent) had a suicide-related adverse event (worsening suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or both). Seven patients attempted suicide (four in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> plus CBT group, two in the fluoxetine monotherapy group, and one in the CBT monotherapy group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were no completed suicides. A subsequent analysis did not include two of the suicide attempts in the combination group (one occurred after the patient prematurely terminated from the assigned treatment, and one was not coded as a suicide attempt according to the Columbia-Classification Algorithm for Suicidal Assessment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>During the long-term phase, suicidal ideation decreased with treatment in all groups, but less so in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Differences in results may be due at least partially to study methods, such as adjusting the analyses for potential confounding factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of eight observational studies (n &gt;200,000 patients) found that exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adolescents with moderate or severe depression was associated with an increased risk for attempted or completed suicide (OR 1.9, CI 1.5-2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, adolescents who received treatment with SSRIs may have been more severely depressed and at greater risk of suicide than those who did not receive SSRIs (confounding by indication). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent retrospective study used an administrative claims database to examine the use of antidepressants and the number of suicide attempts that occurred before and after the FDA issued its warnings about a possible increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior due to antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The dataset included a cohort of children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years (n &gt;1 million), and the analyses used psychotropic drug poisonings as a proxy for suicide attempts. The study found that in the second year (2006) after the warnings, use of antidepressants declined by 31 percent, whereas psychotropic drug poisonings increased by 22 percent. It is worth noting that psychotropic poisonings may reflect substance abuse rather than suicidality. &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another subsequent study used administrative databases to identify youth ages 5 to 17 years with new episodes of depression (n &gt;200,000), who were followed for up to 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The analyses compared the frequency of self harm (suicide attempts and self inflicted injury) in patients who were either treated or not treated with antidepressants, and included adjustments for potential confounding due to patient characteristics that change over time (eg, demographics, prior self harm, comorbid conditions, and psychiatric hospitalization) and can affect the probability of receiving an antidepressant and the outcome of treatment. Although the initial unadjusted analyses found that antidepressant treatment was associated with an increased risk of self harm, the adjusted analyses did not.</p><p/><p>Observational studies suggest that in children and adolescents, the risk of suicide attempts associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors appears to be similar across different medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study using an insurance claims database and medical records identified more than 38,000 youth who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, including 419 patients with medically treated suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After adjusting for the propensity to receive a particular antidepressant as well as factors such as age, mental health diagnoses, and use of psychotropic medications, the analyses showed that the rate of suicide attempts for users of fluoxetine was comparable to the rate for each of the other antidepressants. However, the risk of suicide attempts was elevated in patients treated with multiple antidepressants concurrently, compared with patients who were treated with fluoxetine alone (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6). This elevated risk may reflect increased severity of depression rather than a drug effect.</p><p>In addition, relatively high starting doses of antidepressants prescribed for children and adolescents appear to be associated with suicidal behavior. An observational study used an insurance claims database of depressed patients aged 10 to 24 years (n &gt;39,000), and compared the incidence of suicide attempts in patients who started SSRIs at modal (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 20 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> 50 mg per day) or higher than modal doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The analyses included propensity score matching to balance the two groups with regard to observed potential confounders (eg, depression severity and previous self harm). The risk of deliberate self harm was two-fold greater in patients who initiated treatment at the higher dose (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.0). This corresponded to approximately one additional suicide attempt for every 130 patients who started treatment with each regimen. Despite propensity score matching, it is possible that patients started at higher doses were at greater risk for suicidal behavior due to a history of treatment nonresponse or treatment response only at higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Between 1999 and 2004, the rates of diagnosis of new episodes of pediatric depression and of treatment with SSRIs were increasing. After the FDA advisory, there was a reversal in both of these trends, without evidence of a significant increase in other treatment modalities. In addition, care and treatment of children and adolescents with depression shifted from generalists to psychiatrists.</p><p>The aforementioned studies did not evaluate the possible underlying causes of the shifts in diagnosis of depression and prescribing of antidepressants for children and adolescents. One possibility is that the original increase in depression rates and use of antidepressants in children reflected over-diagnosis and misuse of medication. If this is correct, then the decrease after the FDA warnings is an appropriate outcome. Alternatively, current practice could reflect a substantial problem with under-diagnosis and undertreatment of depression.</p><p>What is clear is that since the FDA warnings, general practitioners are diagnosing less pediatric depression and prescribing fewer antidepressants to children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,50,51</a>]. While psychiatrists are treating slightly more youth depression, it is not enough to compensate for the observed decline in primary care. The observed rates of diagnosis after the FDA advisory (0.3 to 0.5 percent) are substantially lower than previously published incidences of child (0.4 to 2.5 percent) and adolescent depression (0.4 to 8.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. It is still too soon to know the impact and meaning of these trends on the treatment and prognosis of depression in children and adolescents. Some studies show that five years from the FDA Advisory, the initial decline in SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents has reversed, whereas another study shows the decline is ongoing. Continued monitoring and studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,53,54</a>].</p><p>According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1985 suicides occurred among children and adolescents aged 10 through 19 years in 2004, compared with 1737 in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. This was the first increase in the suicide rate in this age group in more than ten years. Similarly, in the Netherlands, the suicide rate in children and adolescents increased by 49 percent between 2003 and 2005; during the same time period, SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased by 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Similar results were found in a 2008 Canadian study which examined data 9 years before and 2 years after Health Canada&rsquo;s regulatory warning on prescribing antidepressants to children and adolescents (which occurred in June 2003, 4 months before the FDA&rsquo;s October warning). Suicide deaths in children and adolescents increased significantly by 25 percent, corresponding to a significant decrease in antidepressant prescriptions of 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In addition, changes were found in treatment that was not directly targeted by the warning: antidepressant prescriptions for young adults (18 to 24 years) decreased significantly, as did follow up visits for depression for children, adolescents, and young adults. </p><p>The black box warning was intended to bring attention to and close monitoring of antidepressants in children and adolescents, not to decrease the amount of prescriptions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment for depression.
