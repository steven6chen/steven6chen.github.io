The focus of the general news media is on the professional athletes who are caught using hormonal drugs, most commonly, androgens, in sporting events such as the Olympic Games and major league baseball. However, the majority of individuals using these medications are recreational athletes (eg, weightlifters and bodybuilders) who use them to improve overall strength and personal appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on the epidemiology, physical and adverse effects, and detection of hormones used to improve athletic performance and physical appearance.

Bodybuilders and nonathletes use androgens as a strategy to increase muscle mass, improve performance, and enhance physical attractiveness. The frequency of this use of drugs by athletes and nonathletes has been addressed in a number of studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of androgenic steroids (AS) has become a serious global public health problem.

Among elite athletes, the most commonly detected AS are testosterone, stanozolol, and nandrolone.

Often, androgen users &quot;pyramid&quot; their doses in cycles of 6 to 12 weeks. They start with low doses of each AS, slowly increase until the middle of the cycle, and then taper back down to zero. Many users follow each treatment cycle with an &quot;off-cycle&quot; for recovery and to avoid detection. Androgen deficiency may occur during this interval, and users typically take other medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate or hCG to attempt to help the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis recover more quickly, but there is no evidence that they do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Users may attempt to counter a side effect of one medication with another medication. As examples, most <strong>stacks</strong> will include both androgens and other drugs such as growth hormone for additional anabolic effect, hCG to counteract the reduction in testicular size resulting from high-dose androgen use, an aromatase inhibitor to counteract gynecomastia, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to prevent balding and acne that occur with exogenous androgens, and diuretics to promote water loss.

The conventional method is to determine the urinary ratio of testosterone glucuronide to its endogenous epimer, epitestosterone glucuronide <span class=\"nowrap\">(T/E</span> ratio). Normally the ratio is 1:1 to 3:1, but subjects taking exogenous testosterone, which suppresses the production of both testosterone and epitestosterone and replaces it only with testosterone, have higher ratios, usually &gt;6:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, a <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio of &gt;4:1 is considered evidence of doping by WADA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The limitation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio is shown by the much greater between, than within, subject variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The reason for this difference has been shown to result from heterozygosity in the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase UGT2B17 that converts testosterone to testosterone glucuronide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50268 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. No such heterozygosity apparently exists in the UGT2B17 that converts epitestosterone to epitestosterone glucuronide. The consequence is that a man who has a deletion of both copies of this enzyme converts testosterone to testosterone glucuronide poorly, so after an injection of exogenous testosterone, his <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio is much lower than a man who has two copies of the gene. This deletion is more common in Asians than Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Conventional monitoring by this ratio, therefore, is much less likely to detect the athlete who has both copies deleted and who takes exogenous testosterone than the athlete who has two normal copies of the gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50268 \">figure 2</a>). The investigators who elucidated this heterozygosity proposed setting normal ranges for the <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio depending on whether or not the athlete has two, one, or no copies of this gene. In addition, some single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the <em>CYP17</em> gene are associated with higher <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio, which may explain why some normal individuals have naturally high <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratios in the absence of androgen abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Another limitation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio is that athletes can mask testosterone use by taking gonadotropins or epitestosterone, which can reduce the <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon <span class=\"nowrap\">13/carbon</span> 12 ratio &ndash; The method currently considered most accurate is determination of the ratio of carbon 13 (13C) to carbon 12 (12C) in urinary metabolites of testosterone using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This method is used to confirm exogenous testosterone use in men with a <span class=\"nowrap\">T/E</span> ratio &gt;4. The rationale is that pharmacologic testosterone preparations are synthesized from plant sterols, which have a lower ratio of 13C to 12C than do endogenous testosterones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-androgens-and-other-hormones-by-athletes/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

The most common way is to discontinue the drug before testing will occur.

He should be monitored every few months until recovery occurs. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) should not be prescribed, because it has not been shown to speed this process, and because some men say they want to stop taking androgens as an excuse to get a prescription for hCG. (See <a href=\"#H436159222\" class=\"local\">'Recovery of testicular function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human growth hormone is also commonly used to enhance athletic performance. Clinical trial data suggest that while lean body mass may be increased by growth hormone use, strength and exercise capacity is not. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of exogenous growth hormone use by athletes is difficult. There are two approaches currently being used: measurement of markers of growth hormone action (insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] and procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide [P-III-NP]) and measurement of growth hormone isoforms that can distinguish exogenous growth hormone from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythropoietin increases the blood's maximum capacity to transport and utilize oxygen, thereby augmenting aerobic power and physical exercise tolerance. Major adverse effects of erythropoietin include myocardial infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic disease. (See <a href=\"#H364314742\" class=\"local\">'Erythropoietin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other banned substances and dietary supplements that are often used by athletes include stimulants, insulin, and beta blockers. Creatine is not currently on the list of banned substances of any governing bodies, but the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) prohibits its distribution to athletes by its member institutions.
