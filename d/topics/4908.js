However, this classic, time-based definition of TIA is inadequate for several reasons. Most notably, there is risk of permanent tissue injury (ie, infarction) even when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour.</p><p>In the tissue-based definition, TIA is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, <strong>without</strong> acute infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In keeping with this definition of TIA, ischemic stroke is defined as an infarction of central nervous system tissue (brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death) attributable to ischemia, based on neuropathologic, neuroimaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical evidence of permanent injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Thus, the benign connotation of &quot;TIA&quot; has been replaced by an understanding that even relatively brief ischemia can cause permanent brain injury. (See <a href=\"#H369801432\" class=\"local\">'Symptom duration and infarction'</a> below.)</p><p>The advantages of tissue-based definitions of TIA and stroke include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The defined end point is biologic (tissue injury, as confirmed or excluded by neuroimaging) rather than arbitrary (24 hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definition encourages use of neurodiagnostic tests to identify brain injury and its cause</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence or absence of ischemic brain is more accurately reflected</p><p/><p>The shortcomings of tissue-based definitions of <span class=\"nowrap\">TIA/stroke</span> include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dependency on the sensitivity and availability of neuroimaging &ndash; Infarctions associated with classically-defined TIA are often very small; most are less than 1 mL in volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Imaging methods that have low sensitivity for small infarcts, such as CT or conventional MRI, would result in more transient events being classified as TIA due to the absence of objective evidence of infarction. Conversely, imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI, with its higher sensitivity for acute infarction, would increase the proportion of transient events classified as ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. High variance in practice for imaging in a patient with suspected TIA would reduce the ability to compare studies from different institutions as well as from different time periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dependency on population and case-mix &ndash; The diagnosis of tissue-based TIA depends not only on the sensitivity of imaging but also on clinical judgment as to whether the signs and symptoms are consistent with an ischemic syndrome so that an imaging study can be justified. Hence, the prevalence of TIA by tissue-based definition depends on the population characteristics and the case mix, particularly the mixture of typical and atypical transient spells (see <a href=\"#H1490752233\" class=\"local\">'Typical TIA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H471786868\" class=\"local\">'Atypical TIA'</a> below). There is a high variance in the prevalence of tissue-based TIA, with infarct rates ranging from 4 to 34 percent by CT and 21 to 67 percent by diffusion-weighted MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered risk of imminent stroke &ndash; The early risk of stroke after a tissue-based TIA seems to be much lower than the risk after a time-based TIA. In a pooled analysis of 4574 patients, the seven-day risk of stroke after a tissue-based TIA was 0.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], a rate that was eight times lower than the corresponding risk in time-based TIA (3.2 percent). Hence, tissue-based TIA conveys much less prognostic information (ie, imminent risk of subsequent stroke) than time-based TIA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369801432\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom duration and infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of ischemic symptoms does not reliably distinguish whether a symptomatic ischemic event will result in ischemic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A classically defined TIA with symptoms lasting for as little as a few minutes can be associated with infarction on diffusion-weighted MRI imaging (DWI), whereas a spell lasting for many hours may show no signs of infarction on DWI.</p><p>Some reports suggest that increased duration of classically defined TIA (&lt;24 hours in duration) is associated with a higher probability of infarction on DWI, but the association is not absolute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-11</a>]. A systematic analysis of patients with classically defined TIA found that symptom duration was not a reliable predictor for the presence of infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82729 \">figure 1</a>), even though the mean duration tended to be significantly longer in patients with infarction than in those without infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>One potential caveat is that abnormalities on initial imaging such as diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI obtained during or soon after symptoms, may actually be reversible injuries. However, most patients with TIA seek medical attention after their symptoms fully resolve; a low proportion (&le;7 percent) of patients with classically defined TIA are admitted and scanned at the height of their symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8-10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,12</a>]. Therefore, infarcts observed in patients with classically defined TIA most likely represent permanent brain injury, as the probability of DWI reversibility decreases as the time from symptom onset to imaging increases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIA is a common neurologic problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a mainly white population from Rochester Minnesota, a population-based study reported that the incidence rate of TIA for the years 1985 to 1989 was 68 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a community-based registry study from Italy, the incidence of TIA from 2007 to 2009 was 52 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region of the United States, where the ethnic and socioeconomic demographics are similar to that of the United States as a whole, another population-based study found that the adjusted incidence rate for TIA from 1993 to 1994 was 83 per 100,000 people, and that blacks and men had significantly higher rates of TIA than whites and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Data from several reports suggest that using the tissue-based definition will decrease the annual rate of TIA by approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A TIA should be considered a syndrome. The symptoms of a TIA depend upon the pathophysiologic subtype, which are divided into three main mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large artery, low-flow TIA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolic TIA, which may be artery-to-artery, or due to a cardioaortic or unknown source</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacunar or small penetrating vessel TIA</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-flow TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large artery low-flow TIAs are often associated with a tightly stenotic atherosclerotic lesion at the internal carotid artery origin or in the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (siphon) when collateral flow from the circle of Willis to the ipsilateral middle or anterior cerebral artery is impaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65199\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65199 \">figure 3</a>). Other important causes include atherosclerotic stenotic lesions in the middle cerebral artery stem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81813\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81813 \">figure 4</a>) or at the junction of the vertebral and basilar artery. Any obstructive vascular process in the extracranial or intracranial arteries can cause a low-flow TIA syndrome if collateral flow to the potentially ischemic brain also is impaired.</p><p>Low-flow TIAs usually are short-lived (minutes) and often recurrent. They may occur as little as several times per year but typically occur more often (once per week or up to several times per day).</p><p>Low-flow TIAs are generally stereotyped, especially when they are due to hemodynamically significant stenotic lesions at the origin of the internal carotid artery, at the siphon portion of the internal carotid artery where collateral flow to the circle of Willis is inadequate, or in the middle cerebral artery stem. Symptoms due to ischemia from these lesions often include hand, arm, leg, face, tongue, or cheek numbness or weakness together, or a combination of one or more. Recurrent aphasic syndromes appear when there is focal ischemia in the dominant hemisphere, and recurrent neglect occurs in the presence of focal or nondominant hemisphere ischemia.</p><p>In contrast, recurrent symptoms are often <strong>not</strong> stereotyped when the stenotic lesion that obstructs flow involves the vertebrobasilar junction or the basilar artery. The many closely packed neuronal structures in the brainstem preclude consistent manifestations of recurrent focal ischemia in this area.</p><p>Nevertheless, certain generalizations about recurrent low-flow TIA symptoms in the posterior circulation can be made.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive lesions in the distal vertebral artery or at the vertebrobasilar junction usually cause disorganized dizziness that may or may not include spinning or vertigo. The patient may complain that the room is tilting or that the floor is coming up at them, rather than spinning dizziness. Patients most often use the word dizziness to describe a myriad of symptoms, not necessarily spinning. Other symptoms may include numbness of one side of the body or face, dysarthria, or diplopia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia in the pons from stenotic lesions in the proximal to mid-basilar artery can cause bilateral leg and arm weakness or numbness and a feeling of heaviness in addition to dizziness. Patients often say it feels as though all of their energy has been drained. They may speak of a feeling of impending doom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia in the territory of the top of the basilar artery or proximal posterior cerebral artery may present with all of the above recurrent symptoms as well as overwhelming drowsiness, vertical diplopia, eyelid drooping, and an inability to look up. Transient ischemia at the top of the basilar artery is usually due to embolism rather than low-flow TIA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolic TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolic TIAs are characterized by discrete, usually single, more prolonged (hours) episodes of focal neurologic symptoms. The embolus may arise from a pathologic process in an artery, usually extracranial, or from the heart (eg, atrial fibrillation or left ventricular thrombus) or aorta. If the primary pathologic process is thought to be embolic, a diligent search for its source is necessary before therapy to prevent future stroke can be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Embolic TIAs typically last hours rather than minutes as in low-flow TIAs. As an example, in one study that divided patients with TIAs into those with symptoms of short duration (less than 60 minutes) or long duration (60 minutes or greater), the latter group was more likely to have an embolic source (86 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Embolic TIAs also may be infrequent since they are the result of emboli from a specific source (eg, a one, two, or three-time phenomenon). When the source of the embolus is in a proximal vessel, recurrent emboli can lodge in different branches of the parent vessel giving different symptoms.</p><p>Emboli are subject to natural thrombolysis and migration since they typically break off of fresh thrombus. They may produce transient ischemia on many occasions, but an element of silent infarction remains.</p><p>Embolic TIAs are best divided into those in the anterior cerebral circulation (carotid, anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery territory) and those in the posterior cerebral circulation (vertebrobasilar, posterior cerebral artery territory). Symptoms in both circulations depend upon the size of the embolic fragment in relation to the size of the artery occluded.</p><p>Embolic TIAs in the anterior circulation may be large enough to occlude the middle cerebral artery stem, producing a contralateral hemiplegia secondary to ischemia in the deep white matter and basal <span class=\"nowrap\">ganglion/internal</span> capsule lenticulostriate territory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60945 \">figure 5</a>). In addition, they may produce cortical surface symptoms when pial collateral flow is inadequate. These include aphasic syndromes in the dominant hemisphere and anosognosia or neglect in the nondominant hemisphere.</p><p>Smaller emboli that occlude branches of the middle cerebral artery stem result in more focal symptoms, including hand alone or arm and hand numbness, weakness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heaviness induced by ischemia to the frontal area of the contralateral frontal lobe motor system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81813\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81813 \">figure 4</a>). The symptoms also may be as specific as thumb or hand numbness or a swollen feeling, suggesting focal ischemia in the hand area of the sensory strip or parietal association cortex.</p><p>Transient monocular visual loss often signifies atherothrombotic disease in the internal carotid artery proximal to the ophthalmic artery origin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)&quot;</a>). Atherothrombotic disease is most often responsible for these syndromes, although carotid dissection and embolism from the aorta, heart, or an unknown source also should be considered. In a report of 129 patients with monocular visual loss of presumed ischemic origin, diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain revealed concurrent acute brain infarcts in 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These infarcts were typically small, often multiple, frequently ipsilateral to the involved eye, and usually asymptomatic. The finding of concurrent acute brain infarction in a patient with transient monocular visual loss suggests a proximal source of embolic particles that travel to both the retinal and hemispheric circulations.</p><p>Posterior circulation territory embolic TIAs are generally produced by emboli arising from atherothrombotic disease at the origin or distal segment of one of the vertebral arteries or of the proximal basilar artery. Emboli arising from the aortic arch, the heart, an unknown source, or from a dissecting lesion in the vertebral artery should also be considered.</p><p>Symptoms vary according to the vertebral or basilar artery branch in which the emboli lodges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60416\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60416 \">figure 6</a>). Emboli can produce transient ataxia, dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, quadrantanopsia, hemianopsia, numbness, crossed face and body numbness, and focal hearing loss. When the top of the basilar artery is embolized, sudden, overwhelming stupor or coma may ensue due to bilateral medial thalamic, subthalamus, and medial rostral midbrain reticular activating system ischemia. Emboli in the more distal branches of the posterior cerebral artery may result in a homonymous field defect or in memory loss (inferior medial temporal lobe ischemia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lacunar or small vessel TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lacunar or penetrating or small vessel TIAs are due to transient cerebral ischemia induced by stenosis of one of the intracerebral penetrating vessels arising from the middle cerebral artery stem, the basilar artery, or the vertebral artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53412 \">figure 7</a>), or the circle of Willis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65199\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65199 \">figure 3</a>). Occasionally, recurrent stereotyped TIAs occur; in this setting, the term lacunar or small vessel TIAs seems appropriate.</p><p>Lacunar or small vessel TIAs are thought to be caused either by atherothrombotic obstructive lesions at the origin of the penetrating vessel or by lipohyalinosis distally within the penetrating vessel. Embolism is rarely proposed as the mechanism. These small vessel TIAs cause symptoms similar to the lacunar strokes that are likely to follow. Thus, face, arm, and leg weakness or numbness due to ischemia in the internal capsule, pons, or thalamus may occur, similar to the symptoms due to ischemia from embolism or large vessel atherothrombotic disease or dissection. As a result, serious disease in the parent vessel must be excluded before the diagnosis of lacunar or small vessel TIA can be established with confidence.</p><p>Lacunar infarcts may be preceded by lacunar TIAs consisting of brief repetitive stereotyped clinical symptoms and signs, and lacunar stroke onset may be stepwise and progressive rather than abrupt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Such a pattern of TIAs, or non-sudden onset in association with a lacunar syndrome, is highly suggestive of small vessel lipohyalinotic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Since few patients with suspected TIA present when fully symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], determining the likelihood of ischemia as the cause of the event often depends upon the history as reported by the patient and witnesses. A key problem with the diagnosis of TIA is how to determine if symptoms are caused by ischemia when brain imaging is normal. Although clinical features are not definitive for etiology, an ischemic insult is the most likely cause when the attack is consistent with a typical TIA (ie, one with transient, focal neurologic symptoms localizing to a single vascular territory), as discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490752233\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical TIA are characterized by transient, focal neurologic symptoms that can be localized to a single vascular territory within the brain.

Alternatively, it may be the case that the sensitivity of MRI is not sufficient to reveal the ischemic lesions associated with atypical spells. In addition, one report that evaluated 275 patients with definite vertebrobasilar territory infarction found that preceding transient isolated brainstem symptoms occurred in 16 percent, suggesting that isolated brainstem symptoms can sometimes signify an ischemic attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-RISK LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four pathologic processes that give rise to low-flow TIAs or embolic TIAs and that can produce sudden devastating stroke if not recognized and treated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherothrombotic stenotic lesions at the origin of the internal carotid artery that are narrowed more than 70 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial atherothrombotic disease that produces low-flow or embolic TIA due to lesions at the distal vertebral <span class=\"nowrap\">artery/vertebrobasilar</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">junction/proximal</span> basilar artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emboli to the top of the basilar artery or the middle cerebral artery stem that come from a source below, either arterial, aortic, or cardiac</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection lesions at the origin of the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery or at the C1-2 level of the vertebral artery as it enters the foramen transversarium</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal carotid artery TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atherothrombotic stenotic lesion at the origin of the internal carotid artery that is narrowed to more than 70 percent of its normal lumen diameter poses a threat of embolic or low-flow TIA or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Even a 50 percent stenosis may be important when considering carotid endarterectomy for prevention of a secondary stroke or of a primary stroke when a TIA has occurred.

In one series of 500 patients, for example, the incidence of stroke was 1.7 percent per year overall but 5.5 percent per year in those with more than a 75 percent carotid artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>This degree of stenosis corresponds to a residual lumen diameter of 1.5 mm, the precise point at which pressure drops across the stenotic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. When the pressure drops, flow to the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery stem is in part supplied by collateral circulation from the circle of Willis and from the external carotid to ophthalmic to distal internal carotid artery system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65199\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65199 \">figure 3</a>). Less flow is provided by the internal carotid artery as the lesion further narrows. We believe that this provides a milieu for thrombus formation at the site of the stenosis and subsequent embolism. When the circle of Willis is compromised, low-flow TIA ensues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial atherothrombotic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial atherothrombotic disease that produces low-flow or embolic TIA most commonly occurs at the distal vertebral <span class=\"nowrap\">artery/vertebrobasilar</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">junction/proximal</span> basilar artery site. The potential of this lesion to precipitate a disastrous stroke by thrombosis, thrombus propagation, and embolism is extremely important. The other two most important, but less common, sites include the siphon portion of the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery stem. The common carotid artery origin and the vertebral artery origin are much less problematic since they only rarely give rise to artery-to-artery emboli.</p><p>The ability to noninvasively diagnose and follow these intracranial arterial lesions with precision through MRI angiography, CT angiography, duplex Doppler, and transcranial Doppler flow assessment allows for important preventive therapeutic considerations.

Recognition of TIAs can identify patients who may benefit from preventive therapy or from revascularization of large vessels such as the carotid artery. Therefore, the initial evaluation of suspected TIA and minor ischemic stroke includes urgent brain imaging, neurovascular imaging, and a cardiac evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F107065\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107065 \">algorithm 1</a>).

The proposed advantages of the tissue-based definition are that the defined end point is biological (tissue injury) rather than arbitrary (24 hours). In addition, a tissue based definition encourages the use of neurodiagnostic tests to identify brain injury and its cause. (See <a href=\"#H2074998073\" class=\"local\">'Definition of TIA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic, time-based definition of TIA is a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sign lasting less than 24 hours, caused by a transient decrease in blood supply. Although still widely used, this classic definition is inadequate because even relatively brief ischemia can cause permanent brain injury. A substantial proportion of patients with classically defined TIA (&lt;24 hours in duration) have corresponding relevant ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted or perfusion-weighted MRI. The associated infarctions are often very small. (See <a href=\"#H2074998073\" class=\"local\">'Definition of TIA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large artery low-flow TIAs are often associated with a tightly stenotic atherosclerotic lesions of the internal carotid artery origin, middle cerebral artery stem, or junction of the vertebral and basilar artery. Low-flow TIAs usually are short-lived (minutes) and often recurrent. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Low-flow TIA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolic TIAs are characterized by discrete, usually single, more prolonged (hours) episodes of focal neurologic symptoms. The embolus may arise from a pathologic process in an artery, usually extracranial, or from the heart (eg, atrial fibrillation or left ventricular thrombus) or aorta. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Embolic TIA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacunar or penetrating or small vessel TIAs are induced by stenosis of one of the intracerebral penetrating vessels arising from the middle cerebral artery stem, the basilar artery, or the vertebral artery. They are caused either by atherothrombotic obstructive lesions at the origin of the penetrating vessel or by lipohyalinosis distally within the penetrating vessel. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lacunar or small vessel TIA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several pathologic processes can cause low-flow TIAs or embolic TIAs that can produce sudden devastating stroke if not recognized and treated (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'High-risk lesions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atherothrombotic lesions of the internal carotid artery that are narrowed more than 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intracranial atherothrombotic disease that produces low-flow or embolic TIA </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Emboli to the top of the basilar artery or the middle cerebral artery stem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial dissection of the internal carotid artery or the vertebral artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIA is a neurologic emergency.
