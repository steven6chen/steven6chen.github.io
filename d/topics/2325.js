It is unclear if budesonide is more effective at inducing remission as compared with 5-ASA. (See <a href=\"#H165107889\" class=\"local\">'Crohn disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>-MMX is effective in inducing remission. Topical therapy with budesonide foam enema appears to be well tolerated and is efficacious in inducing remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative proctitis and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. (See <a href=\"#H165107983\" class=\"local\">'Ulcerative colitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Budesonide</a> is not effective for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease. Although modest benefits were noted in lowering disease activity scores and prolonging time to relapse of disease, these benefits are offset by higher treatment-related adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of remission'</a> above and <a href=\"#H165107997\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Budesonide</a> is associated with significantly fewer glucocorticoid-associated systemic adverse events. Data regarding the safety of budesonide with respect to bone mineral metabolism suggest that budesonide has limited effect on bone mineral density. Budesonide can reduce the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress, but to a lesser extent than conventional glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H201639153\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Budesonide</a> may be used in pregnancy to treat disease flares, but it should not be used as an alternative therapy or a substitute after withdrawal of an effective medication. The lowest possible dose should be used, and if possible, its use should be avoided in the first trimester due to the risk of oral clefts. Budesonide is compatible with breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H201639219\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budesonide-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brattsand R.
