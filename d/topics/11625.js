However, it can result in vascular compromise leading to testicular ischemia and injury, and if not corrected, necrosis and testicular nonviability. Nevertheless, the management of neonatal testicular torsion remains controversial, as opinions differ on whether surgery can successfully salvage the torsed testis, which may have occurred in utero, and whether the contralateral side is at increased risk for torsion.</p><p>The clinical presentation and the controversies regarding management of neonatal testicular torsion will be reviewed here. Testicular torsion in children and adolescents is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span></p><p>Neonatal testicular torsion is defined as torsion that occurs prenatally and up to 30 days after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Neonatal testicular torsion can be divided into two groups based upon the timing of detection before or after birth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prenatal (non-acute) event</strong> &ndash; Because prenatal testicular torsion is an <em>in utero</em> event, it is a non-acute event. The torsion can generally be detected in the immediate postpartum period (ie, at delivery or during the initial newborn examination), though may be misinterpreted as a nonpalpable, undescended testicle (&quot;vanishing testis syndrome&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postnatal (acute) event</strong> &ndash; Postnatal testicular torsion occurs after birth. It is detected as a change in the testicular examination in a testicle that was previously noted to be normal during the newborn examination. Because intervention may potentially salvage a functioning testis, if torsion is detected in a timely manner, postnatal torsion is considered an acute event.</p><p/><p>The clinical presentation and management approaches differ based on whether the testicular torsion occurs prenatally or postnatally as an acute event. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Testicular torsion can also be divided by the following two underlying pathologic process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69292 \">figure 1</a>). Both mechanisms result in vascular compromise to the testes. If blood flow is not restored in a timely fashion (approximately four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]), testicular ischemia, infarction, and subsequent atrophy will occur.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extravaginal testicular torsion</strong> involves the entire testicle including the covering of the testicle and the tunica vaginalis investment, as the tunica vaginalis (serous sac that contains the testicle and sections of the body and tip of the epididymis) is not fixed to the scrotal wall in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Neonatal testicular torsion is most commonly an extravaginal process. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravaginal testicular torsion,</strong> which is typically seen in older patients, is caused by the testis and spermatic cord twisting within the tunica vaginalis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal testicular torsion accounts for 10 to 12 percent of all cases of pediatric testicular torsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The reported incidence from a study from Great Britain was 6.1 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, this may be an underestimation, as monorchidism (absence of one testicle) due to an atrophic testicle is most likely due to an undetected intrauterine torsion event, also referred to as the &quot;vanishing testis syndrome&quot;. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monorchidism'</a> below.)</p><p>In the majority of cases, torsion occurs in utero as demonstrated by case series reporting 70 to 80 percent of patients presenting with prenatal torsion, and the remaining presenting after the immediate postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>Bilateral involvement has been reported in approximately 5 to 20 percent of all neonatal torsion events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. However, the true rate of bilateral torsion remains uncertain, as there may be reporting bias of bilateral involvement. which skews the results to a higher incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanism of neonatal testicular torsion is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Neonatal testicular torsion is most commonly an extravaginal event involving the entire testicle including the tunica vaginalis investment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69292 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is thought that torsion occurs after the testicle descends into the scrotum, but prior to fixation in the scrotum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. The mobility of the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> tunica vaginalis in the scrotum appears to make the testicle more susceptible to twisting with rotation along the long axis of the spermatic cord resulting in extravaginal torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The attachment of the tunica vaginalis appears to occur within the first few weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. However, if the securing of the tunica vaginalis was the only predisposing factor for torsion, one would expect torsion to be more frequent in preterm infants, contrary to what is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Therefore, other factors must play a role in the pathogenesis of neonatal torsion.</p><p>It has been postulated that an increased intrauterine pressure during the third trimester of pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delivery results in a brisk cremaster response in the setting of loose tunic-scrotal attachment. This would predispose the testicle to twisting of the spermatic cord, and results in compromise of testicular blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. Support for this mechanism is based upon the observation that neonatal torsion has been associated with complicated pregnancies, including breech presentation and preeclampsia, post-term births, difficult vaginal deliveries, and full term infants who are above average birth weights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/12-14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,16</a>].</p><p>In contrast, intravaginal torsion with twisting of the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis occurs in older patients and rarely in neonates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation and course vary depending upon whether testicular torsion occurs in utero (prenatal or non-acute event) or after birth (postnatal or acute event).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal torsion is detected at or within 24 hours of delivery during the initial newborn examination. The neonate does not demonstrate any clinical signs of distress. The timing of the torsion in utero is estimated by the physical appearance of the testicle, which impacts the management approach (see <a href=\"#H835347317\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal testicular torsion'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early prenatal torsion &ndash; If the torsion occurred early in utero, the neonate presents with a firm, small testicle or even with an absent, pea-sized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nubbin testicle (&quot;vanishing testis syndrome&quot;). In these cases, it is difficult to differentiate between a torsed testicle that has atrophied versus an abdominal testicle which is nonpalpable. For this reason, we do not recommend intervening on the contralateral testicle, as testicular torsion cannot be confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late prenatal torsion &ndash; Torsion occurring close to or during the time of delivery presents with an enlarged, firm testicle. The testicle can be tender or nontender, depending on proximity to delivery, with a typically discolored hemiscrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80664\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80664 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/3,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12</a>].</p><p/><p>In infants with prenatal torsion, surgery generally fails to save the testis, with salvage rates ranging from 0 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,8,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11,16</a>], although one study reported a higher salvageable rate of 27 percent (3 of 11 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since it is extremely rare to preserve function in the prenatal or non-acute torsion event, the focus becomes the health of the contralateral testis and prevention of the rarely reported contralateral concomitant (synchronous) or asynchronous torsion that has extreme consequences for the child with resulting bilateral anorchia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Contralateral testicle'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postnatal torsion presents with acute tenderness, swelling, and overlying scrotal skin changes in a testicle that was previously noted to be normal on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Surgical intervention has a reported salvage rate of 30 to 40 percent in postnatal torsion cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-21</a>]. Neonatal torsion occurs in the first month of life, prior to fixation of the tunica vaginalis in the scrotum (extravaginal torsion), whereas infants older than one month typically present with intravaginal torsion and there is up to a fifty percent association with undescended testicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is bilateral involvement, torsion most commonly presents in a synchronous (concomitant) fashion (67 percent) as compared with asynchronous (subsequent) fashion (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In the rarer asynchronous presentation, the infant will initially have a normal contralateral testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The contralateral testicle will be detected either during surgical exploration or later clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The asynchronous presentation may offer a higher potential for testicular salvage, as the torsion may be detected before significant testicular ischemia occurs if emergent intervention is provided in a timely manner. However, contralateral testicular torsion may go unrecognized, as physical exam findings and radiography may not detect abnormalities of the affected contralateral testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Thus, the asynchronous torsed testicle may go unrecognized until surgical exploration is performed on what was thought to be unilateral involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twisting of the spermatic cord during torsion causes testicular vascular compromise, resulting in testicular injury. The extent of the damage is mostly dependent upon the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of torsion &minus; Testicular viability appears to become compromised if ischemia lasts beyond four to six hours. When testicular torsion is greater than four hours duration, some degree of testicular injury in anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In dogs, viability of spermatogenic and Sertoli cells is lost after six hours of ischemia, and viability of Leydig cells after 10 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing rotation of the spermatic cord &minus; Increasing the degree of rotation of the spermatic cord may increase the potential for testicular damage and loss in both extravaginal and intravaginal testicular torsion. In some case series, if torsion is less than 360 degrees (partial torsion), there is a higher likelihood of testicular viability compared with torsion greater than 360 degrees (complete torsion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]; however, testicular infarction can still occur with 180 degrees of torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast, others have found no association between the degree of torsion and testicular viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it can be clinically challenging to distinguish between a complete 360 degree twist from a partial torsion. Because a partial torsion is associated with a greater time necessary for nonviability, surgical exploration is still suggested in patients who are symptomatic for 24 hours or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Monorchidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monorchidism refers to the absence of one testicle, which may be due to either a nonpalpable abdominal testicle or an atrophic testicle. The atrophic testicle, also referred to as the &quot;vanishing testis&quot;, is now commonly recognized as an intrauterine torsion event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Thus, infants born with a nonpalpable testicle are often assumed to have an undescended, abdominal testicle, which is later recognized to be an in utero torsion event at the time of surgical correction for the presumed abdominal testicle. This conclusion is supported by the presence of characteristic histopathologic findings for testicular atrophy secondary to ischemia (ie, presence of vas deferens, epididymis, calcification, or hemosiderin pigmentation in pathology specimens) in almost 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>It remains unknown whether individuals with an atrophic testicle are at increased risk for torsion of the remaining solitary testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In a report of seven atrophic testicles, five of the six contralateral testicles that were explored had abnormal testicular fixation (bell-clapper deformity) that is associated with an increased risk of testicular torsion beyond the neonatal period. In contrast, other case series do not demonstrate an increased likelihood of subsequent testicular torsion of the remaining testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In fact, it may be that non-acute perinatal torsion is associated with a protective effect to the contralateral (often hypertrophied) normal testis. This is based on a lack of literature describing contralateral torsion after four weeks, and only rare events in infants between three and six months of age.</p><p>Further investigation is required to determine whether or not monorchidism due to prenatal torsion is associated with an increased risk of testicular torsion in the remaining solitary testicle. If monorchidism is associated with an increased risk of testicular torsion, then this strengthens the argument to perform contralateral orchiopexy in neonates with testicular torsion, otherwise a nonoperative approach is acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H2456519002\" class=\"local\">'Contralateral orchiopexy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocrine abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infertility and long-term sequelae of sex steroid deficiencies are potential complications for patients with bilateral involvement. Patients with loss of function of both testicles should be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist to ensure proper sex steroid hormonal replacement therapy. Unilateral testicular torsion appears to have a low impact on subsequent fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Contralateral testicle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that the contralateral testicle sustains injury independent of concomitant torsion. For example, in rats, experimentally induced torsion also resulted in damage to the contralateral testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is unclear how this occurs, but suggested mechanisms include reflex vasoconstriction of the contralateral testicular vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], or breakdown of the <span class=\"nowrap\">blood/testis</span> barrier resulting in autoimmunologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. These findings have resulted in the recommendation by some experts in the field to remove the torsed testis, because leaving the injured testis in situ may lead to potential risk to the contralateral testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The suspected diagnosis of neonatal testicular torsion is based upon the presence of characteristic physical findings of testicular torsion. In particular, a hardened, fixed, nontender scrotal mass with a discolored scrotum is almost pathognomonic for prenatal torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Surgical exploration confirms the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic imaging is often performed. However, the accuracy and value of diagnostic testing varies, as these are challenging studies to perform in the neonate. Diagnostic imaging <strong>should not delay emergent intervention</strong> that is deemed necessary based upon the clinical examination and presentation, particularly for patients with an acute presentation.</p><p>Diagnostic studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography with Doppler color flow is the imaging modality of choice because of its general availability and noninvasive nature. With an experienced operator, it has a high sensitivity in detecting testicular torsion by the lack of detected blood flow to the affected testis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93266\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93266 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. A heterogeneous parenchymal echogenicity suggests a torsion event and testicular nonviability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>], and subsequent examinations may demonstrate a decrease in testicular mass with ongoing testicular atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93266\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93266 \">image 1</a>). In contrast, a homogeneous appearance indicates testicular viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Ultrasonography also detects other scrotal pathology both on the affected and contralateral side, such as testicular tumors or hydroceles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">High-resolution ultrasonography of the spermatic cord can also improve diagnosis, as a visualized &quot;twist&quot; in the spermatic cord has high sensitivity (96 percent) and specificity (99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. High-frequency color Doppler ultrasound has had promising results in the differentiation between prenatal and postnatal testicular torsion based on testicular size and echogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, performing an accurate Doppler evaluation is challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It can be difficult to detect blood flow in normal neonates, which may lead to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, there are case reports of asynchronous bilateral testicular torsion confirmed by surgical exploration, in which a preoperative ultrasound did not identify compromise to the contralateral testicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/8,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide scintigraphy with 99m technetium-pertechnetate is a sensitive but less specific test in detecting testicular torsion. The study can be especially difficult to interpret in the neonatal period. The &quot;bull's eye sign&quot; (ie, hyperemic peritesticular rim) is predictive of late torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, the bull's eye sign indicating lack of blood flow does not differentiate torsion from other diagnoses, such as hematocele, hematoma, or necrotic neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Radionuclide scintigraphy also does not provide any other additional anatomical information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, many institutions may not have the proper equipment and personnel to perform this study. Radionuclide scintigraphy is rarely performed in practice, and color Doppler ultrasound remains the standard of care, including in our institution, as it is the most readily available and is noninvasive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers excellent anatomic detail and has been used to differentiate subacute torsion from epididymitis in the adolescent population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, it is costly and logistically difficult to obtain in an emergency setting, which may delay organ preserving surgery. In addition, these infants will generally require anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sedation to undergo MRI.

A hydrocele detected prenatally also may be a sign of testicular torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. However, the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis is unknown, and postnatal imaging should be performed to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In most cases, ultrasonography with Doppler color flow is able to differentiate these diagnoses from testicular torsion.</p><p>For patients with nonpalpable testes, the differential diagnosis includes cryptorchidism and disorder of sex development (DSD) (especially mixed gonadal dysgenesis). However, a diagnosis of DSD is unlikely in a patient with unilateral testicular involvement, and no evaluation for DSD should be performed.

In the neonate, the decision to perform orchiopexy of the noninvolved testis needs to consider the risk of anesthesia, complexity of the surgery (associated hydrocele and hernia in the normal testis), and comfort level of the health care team and facility with operative management of neonates. Access to pediatric specialists, including anesthesiologists as well as pediatric urologists <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pediatric surgeons is also a key consideration. While most studies from tertiary sites with access to pediatric specialists report a low complication rate, other case series report up to an 18 percent complication rate associated with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Several treatment choices must be made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When and if to perform surgical exploration.

These proponents perform expectant surgery even in cases of prenatal torsion with negligible salvage rates because of the possibility of undetected and potential asynchronous (subsequent) torsion of the contralateral testis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>]. Others in the field advocate nonsurgical management of neonatal torsion because of the overall poor salvage rates, their perspective that there is little benefit of removing the torsed testicle, and the potential risks of surgery and anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/8,9,18,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,18,56,57</a>]. In the United States, medical legal factors have also influenced the management of neonatal testicular torsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Some experts in the field, including the author, have adopted a stratified approach based upon the clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75762\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75762 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-acute event (prenatal presentation) &minus; In patients with prenatal torsion, surgery generally fails to save the testis, with salvage rates ranging from 0 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,8,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11,16</a>]. Thus, in cases of unilateral involvement, our approach is to delay surgery until the neonate is stable enough to undergo anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this author's practice, if surgery is the management choice, we typically perform the operation after the first few days of life when the patient is deemed more stable to undergo anesthesia, as the highest risk of asynchronous torsion occurs within the first month of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Others have advocated waiting until one month of age when there is a decrease in both surgical and anesthetic risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,58</a>]. Until the time of surgery, parents are instructed to perform serial examinations of the contralateral testis with each diaper change. An acute change is an indication for emergent evaluation and possible surgical intervention. One potential risk is missing the diagnosis of an unrecognized, contralateral testicular torsion during the one-month delay before surgical exploration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, emergent surgery is indicated in patients with bilateral involvement with the hope of averting anorchia and the long-term complications of infertility and sex steroid deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/8,13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,23</a>]. In this situation, recommendations are to leave the testicles in place, as Leydig cells are more resistant to ischemia, and there is potential for preservation of testosterone production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute event (postnatal presentation) &minus; Surgery is performed for patients with evidence of acute testicular torsion (unilateral and bilateral involvement) as there is a more favorable salvage rates of 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-21</a>].

An inguinal approach is favored if an ultrasound has <strong>not</strong> been performed because of the possibility that the mass may be due to a malignancy and, if so, the need to adhere to principles of oncologic surgery of local tumor control. In addition, hydroceles are commonly observed in the torsed and the contralateral testicle, and an inguinal incision would facilitate closing off a hernia sac if identified at the time of the surgery. Ultimately, the surgical approach will be determined by the comfort level of the surgeon, as avoiding complications is a high priority when performing surgery in a neonate to salvage a torsed testicle or prevent potential contralateral torsion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4200253096\"><span class=\"h3\">Orchiectomy or leave testicle in situ?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If surgical exploration is performed, most experts in the field perform orchiectomy in patients with unilateral torsion. This approach is based upon the poor salvage rates, and, as previously discussed, limited data that suggest leaving the injured testicle in situ results in injury to the contralateral side. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Contralateral testicle'</a> above.)</p><p>In cases with bilateral involvement, when feasible, surgeons should detorse and fix the testicles rather than perform orchiectomy, since the attenuated testes may retain some residual Leydig cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2456519002\"><span class=\"h3\">Contralateral orchiopexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One must weigh the risk of injuring a healthy, uninvolved contralateral testicle when proceeding with a prophylactic maneuver to prevent potential future torsion.

In the United States, almost all pediatric urologists (approximately 95 percent) would perform contralateral orchiopexy, whereas 22 percent of British surgeons would not perform this surgical procedure because of concerns of injuring the uninvolved testis. The authors agree with recommendations to explore the contralateral testicle once the decision has been made to proceed with surgery.

In this approach, parents are instructed to perform serial examinations of the contralateral testicle with each diaper change. An acute change is an indication for emergent evaluation and possible surgical exploration. Ultrasound evaluation may be helpful to confirm non-viable appearance of the torsed testicle and assess the contralateral testicle. Asynchronous contralateral involvement is uncommon and the reported incidence may be inflated because of biased publication of its devastating outcome. Nevertheless, if there is concern for contralateral involvement, surgical exploration is warranted.</p><p>Concerns about this approach include the presence of other scrotal conditions (eg, hydrocele) that hinder an adequate assessment, and a possible long delay in obtaining care when an acute change is noted, especially if there is significant distance between the family's home and a tertiary care center with the appropriate resources and personnel. Also, as noted above, contralateral, asynchronous torsion can be missed on physical exam and radiologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-testicular-torsion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our center, the management of neonatal testicular torsion is based on the following different clinical presentations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75762\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef75762 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early prenatal event typically presents as an absent testicle or a very small, pea-sized nubbin.

It accounts for 10 to 12 percent of all pediatric testicular torsions with a reported incidence of 6.1 per 100,000 live births. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal testicular torsion is typically an extravaginal process that involves twisting of the spermatic cord above the testicle and its tunica vaginalis investments. It is distinct from testicular torsion in the older infant (&gt;1 month of age), child, and adolescent, which is an intravaginal process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69292 \">figure 1</a>).

The neonate typically does not demonstrate any clinical signs of distress:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Prenatal torsion that occurs early in gestation presents as a nonpalpable testicle or an atrophic, nontender nubbin. The affected testis is generally not salvageable regardless of the timing of surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Late prenatal torsion that occurs closer to the time of delivery presents with enlarged, firm, and nontender testicle with a discolored hemiscrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80664\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80664 \">picture 1</a>). It remains uncertain what the salvageable rate is for late prenatal torsion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postnatal torsion presents with acute tenderness and swelling in a testicle that was previously noted to be normal during the birth hospitalization. The surgical salvageable rate may be as high as 30 to 40 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major complication of neonatal torsion is vascular compromise, resulting in testicular ischemia and injury, and if not corrected, necrosis and testicular nonviability.
