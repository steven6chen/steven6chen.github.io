Affected patients can present in a number of different ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Symptoms of heart failure (progressive dyspnea with exertion, impaired exercise capacity, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema) are most common. Other presentations include the incidental detection of asymptomatic cardiomegaly and symptoms related to coexisting arrhythmia, conduction disturbance, thromboembolic complications, or sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

There are also disease-independent predictors of survival, the most important of which are New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, and maximal oxygen consumption (peak VO<sub>2</sub>). These prognostic determinants assume that the cause of the myocardial dysfunction cannot be treated.

Although the term &quot;ischemic cardiomyopathy&quot; has been used to describe ischemic myocardial dysfunction (particularly in North America), this term is not supported by the 2006 American Heart Association or 2007 European Society of Cardiology cardiomyopathy classification systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have known coronary heart disease.

This disorder is typically precipitated by intense psychologic stress and primarily occurs in postmenopausal women. The characteristic finding of apical ballooning is seen on left ventriculography or echocardiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93947\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef93947 \">movie 1</a>).

It is characterized clinically by acute myocarditis, cardiac enlargement, tachycardia, and nonspecific electrocardiogram abnormalities including right bundle branch block and premature ventricular contractions. Patients can develop left ventricular apical aneurysms that are pathognomonic for this disease.

Cardiac muscle dysfunction can also occur; it is often self-limited and mild, leading to transient cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or chest radiograph. However, occasional patients develop symptomatic myocarditis and DCM.

No clinical or histologic criteria, other than family history and careful examination of relatives (including those who are asymptomatic), have been derived to distinguish familial from nonfamilial disease. The mode of inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, although autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance have also been described. These disorders, as well as recommendations for screening and counseling family members, are discussed elsewhere.

These antibodies are also present in 20 to 30 percent of the first and second degree relatives of DCM patients, compared with 1 to 2 percent of control subjects. Furthermore, among relatives of DCM patients, the presence of such antibodies is associated with a greater likelihood of developing DCM.

LVNC has been identified in 0.05 percent of patients undergoing echocardiography. Affected patients present with HF, thromboembolism, or ventricular arrhythmias. The diagnosis is established by echocardiography, although the changes can also be seen on magnetic resonance imaging.

Alcohol is believed to be toxic to cardiac myocytes via oxygen free radical damage and defects in cardiac protein synthesis.</p><p>The risk of developing alcoholic DCM is related to both mean daily alcohol intake and the duration of drinking. However, individual susceptibility remains important. The typical finding in patients with alcoholic DCM is left ventricular dilation with reduced ejection fraction. More advanced cases have biventricular failure.

The causes and manifestations of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy are not well defined. The condition has been defined as otherwise unexplained chronic cardiac dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis with impaired contractile responsiveness to stress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction with associated electrophysiologic abnormalities. The left atrium may be dilated but the left ventricular cavity size is generally normal, although dilation may develop in some cases.

Nevertheless, cardiomegaly with otherwise unexplained HF in a young person should raise the possibility of cocaine abuse. Possible mechanisms include a direct toxic effect, the cocaine-induced hyperadrenergic state, and, in parenteral cocaine abusers, an infectious cardiomyopathy. Abstinence usually leads to complete reversal of the myocardial dysfunction.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cardiomyopathy has been reported in patients with chronic supraventricular tachycardias with ventricular rates of 130 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> including atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular nodal reentry, and preexcitation syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. The rate of the tachycardia appears to correlate with the degree of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of myocardial dysfunction in this setting is not clear. Among the changes that have been observed are a reduction in myocyte contractility, abnormalities in myocardial architecture, and a decrease in calcium responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Left ventricular dysfunction can occur without dilation. Definitive treatment of the arrhythmia results in complete reversal of the myocardial dysfunction (generally within three months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of cardiac sarcoidosis depend upon the location and extent of granulomatous inflammation. In addition to a reversible form of DCM, other cardiac manifestations include conduction abnormalities, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, pericarditis, and valvular dysfunction due to papillary muscle involvement. Cardiac involvement may precede, follow, or occur concurrently with involvement of the lungs or other organs. Antecedent pulmonary or other organ involvement may be absent or not apparent and presentation may be limited to cardiac abnormalities. An acute cardiac presentation may resemble hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which is caused by edema rather than myocyte hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should consider the possibility of sarcoid heart disease when confronted with an otherwise healthy young or middle-aged person with cardiac symptoms or a patient with known sarcoidosis who develops arrhythmias, conduction disease, or HF. Diagnosis depends upon recognition of the multisystem features of sarcoidosis and securing the evidence of noncaseating granuloma either in the myocardium or in other affected tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">End-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with end-stage renal disease being treated with hemodialysis can develop a DCM via an uncertain mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmunity may be a cause of DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and the presence of autoantibodies may identify family members of patients with DCM who are at a greater risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Autoimmunity has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>A number of cardiac autoantibodies have been identified. These antibodies target a variety of antigens, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-1 adrenoceptor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-myosin heavy chain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-myosin heavy chain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myosin light chain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Troponin</p><p/><p>Collectively, these autoantibodies are sometimes referred to as anti-heart antibodies (AHAs). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence of pathogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AHAs have not been established as causing DCM in humans, but this is a provocative hypothesis based on animal data. In a rabbit model, immunization with sequences of the beta-1 adrenoreceptor induced the production of beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies and resulted in anatomic and histologic changes in the myocardium resembling those seen in human DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A similar study in rats also demonstrated the production of autoantibodies as well as severe left ventricular dilation and dysfunction in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These findings appear to be applicable to humans since these autoantibodies can be detected in as many as 38 percent of patients with an idiopathic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Support for a pathogenetic role of beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies comes from the efficacy of eliminating them by immunoadsorption. In one report, immunoadsorption completely eliminated the beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies in the 17 patients undergoing this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. After one year, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 22 to 38 percent, left ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased by 15 percent, and the autoantibodies did not reappear. In contrast, there were no changes in antibody levels or left ventricular function in 17 patients with these antibodies who received only standard medical therapy.</p><p>Similar improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction was noted in a later report of eight patients with DCM and beta-1 adrenoceptor antibodies treated with selective immunoadsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The advantage of selective immunoadsorption is that immunoglobulin replacement is not required.</p><p>A potential pathogenic mechanism for beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies was demonstrated in a study of murine DCM induced by beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The autoantibodies acted as agonists, shifting endogenous beta-1 adrenoceptors into the agonist-coupled high-affinity state, thereby triggering an intracellular protein kinase A-dependent signaling cascade in cardiomyocytes. Sustained activation caused intracellular calcium mishandling, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and DCM with HF.</p><p>In addition to a role in some cases of DCM, beta-1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies have also been linked to myocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Anti-beta-1 adrenoceptor antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Familial disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AHAs are found in approximately 30 percent of DCM patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/34,35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,38</a>], and in 20 to 30 percent of their asymptomatic relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The significance of AHAs in the healthy relatives of patients with DCM was evaluated in a series of 169 probands and 592 of their first and second degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AHAs were significantly more common in family members of DCM patients than in patients with noninflammatory heart disease, patients with ischemic heart disease, or normal blood donors (32 versus 1, 1, and 2.5 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relatives of DCM patients who later developed DCM were more likely to have AHAs than were relatives who did not progress (69 versus 37 percent).</p><p/><p>Thus, AHAs were more common in family members of DCM patients than in control subjects, and the presence of AHAs in asymptomatic family members was associated with an increased likelihood of developing disease. However, fully defining the role of autoimmune factors in familial cardiomyopathy requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2391823\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac disease is common in systemic lupus erythematosus. Affected patients can develop valvular, pericardial, or coronary disease or myocarditis. Patients with myocardial involvement can present with resting tachycardia disproportionate to body temperature, electrocardiographic abnormalities (such as ST-T wave abnormalities), and unexplained cardiomegaly. Immunosuppressive therapy does not always lead to improved myocardial function in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2391874\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two reports from Italy suggest that celiac disease, which is often clinically unsuspected, accounts for as many as 5 percent of patients with autoimmune myocarditis or idiopathic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one report of nine such patients, none had classic gastrointestinal symptoms of celiac disease (recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss), but all had iron deficiency anemia refractory to iron replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Cardiac function improved following a gluten-free diet with or without immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Celiac disease'</a>.)</p><p>Although these findings are intriguing, it is premature to screen all patients with otherwise unexplained cardiomyopathy for celiac disease. However, it is reasonable to question for a history of gastrointestinal complaints or refractory iron deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid dysfunction, excess sympathetic activity in pheochromocytoma, and rarely Cushing's syndrome and growth hormone (GH) excess or deficiency can cause cardiac dysfunction, which can usually be reversed by correction of the endocrine disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact mechanisms by which hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism can lead to DCM are not known. Thyroid hormone is known to alter preload, afterload, heart rate, and contractility, each of which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. There is also some evidence in experimental animals that excess T3 causes myocyte hypertrophy and changes in specific protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
