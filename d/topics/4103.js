These fibrils have a predominantly antiparallel &szlig;-pleated sheet configuration (noted on x-ray diffraction), and can be identified on biopsy specimens both by their characteristic appearance on electron microscopy and by their ability to bind Congo red (leading to green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence).</p><p>More than 30 distinct low molecular weight proteins are recognized to form amyloid fibrils. The four most common causes of systemic amyloid deposition are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis (historically referred to as primary amyloidosis) in which the fibrils are composed of fragments of monoclonal light chains. Affected patients may have amyloidosis alone or in association with other plasma cell dyscrasias (multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia). All forms of systemic amyloidosis in which the fibrils are derived from monoclonal light chains, regardless of the nature of the underlying plasma cell disorder (eg, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, multiple myeloma, or Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia) are considered AL amyloidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wild type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt, historically referred to as age-related [senile] amyloidosis) typically involves the heart and causes a restrictive cardiomyopathy. It is caused by deposition of normal unmutated transthyretin (TTR), which appears to be an inherently amyloidogenic protein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary (familial) amyloidosis (ATTRmt) are the result of mutations in genes coding for several different proteins that are normally present in the body. The most common &quot;amyloidogenic proteins&quot; implicated in hereditary amyloidosis are mutated forms of TTR, the alpha chain of fibrinogen A, apolipoprotein AI and AII, lysozyme, and gelsolin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in the amyloid diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AA amyloidosis in which the fibrils are composed of fragments of the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A. AA amyloidosis is typically reactive (secondary) to chronic inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-aa-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Because AL amyloidosis is a clonal plasma cell disorder, it is treated with chemotherapy to eradicate the underlying clone. AL amyloidosis must be differentiated from other forms of amyloidosis (eg, AA amyloidosis, ATTRmt amyloidosis, and ATTRwt amyloidosis) since the latter are non-neoplastic, will not benefit from chemotherapy. </p><p>AL amyloidosis is a systemic disorder that can present with a variety of symptoms or signs, including heavy proteinuria (usually in the nephrotic range), edema, hepatosplenomegaly, otherwise unexplained heart failure, and the carpal tunnel syndrome. Although virtually all patients have multisystem amyloid deposition, it is not uncommon to present with evidence of mainly one organ being affected.

In the United States, the incidence appears to be stable at approximately 6 to 10 cases per million person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>AL amyloidosis is a disease of older adults. As with other plasma cell dyscrasias, the age-specific incidence rates increase in each decade of life after age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The median age at diagnosis is 64 years, and less than 5 percent of patients are under the age of 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. There is a male predominance with men accounting for 65 to 70 percent of patients.</p><p>AL amyloidosis occurs in all races and all geographic locations; however, there are little data regarding whether the incidence varies by ethnicity or geography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to other plasma cell disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients who ultimately show clinical evidence of AL amyloidosis present with what appeared to be monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Once a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is made, such patients are no longer considered to have MGUS. Over time, a small number of patients with MGUS eventually develop symptoms or signs of AL amyloidosis, multiple myeloma (MM), or Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM), at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance#H22391006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;, section on 'Disease progression'</a>.)</p><p>AL amyloidosis can also occur in patients with other plasma cell dyscrasias, including MM and WM, which are malignant disorders of plasma cells or lymphoplasmacytic cells, respectively.</p><p>When MM and AL amyloidosis are diagnosed in the same patient, the myeloma is typically diagnosed before or around the time of the amyloidosis diagnosis. Less commonly, myeloma develops more than six months after the diagnosis of amyloidosis (delayed progression):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 1596 patients with AL amyloidosis seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1994, only six (0.4 percent) showed delayed progression (at 10 to 81 months) to overt myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This usually occurred in patients without cardiac or hepatic amyloidosis who lived long enough to develop myeloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 4319 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1990 and 2008 with a diagnosis of myeloma who had at least six months of follow-up, there were 47 patients (1.1 percent) in whom the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis followed the diagnosis of myeloma by at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Outcome of these patients was poor, especially in those with cardiac involvement, with a median survival after the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis of nine months (95% CI 4-14 months).</p><p/><p>In patients with AL amyloidosis, hypercalcemia, bone pain, or lytic bone lesions is suggestive of the combination of clinical myeloma and amyloidosis. The diagnosis of coexisting MM is reserved for patients with amyloidosis who would otherwise meet diagnostic criteria for MM, usually with clonal bone marrow plasmacytosis &ge;10 percent and one or more myeloma-defining events (MDEs) such as osteolytic bone lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Although AL amyloidosis is not an MDE, outcomes of patients with AL amyloidosis who have clonal bone marrow plasmacytosis &ge;10 percent are comparable to patients meeting criteria for coexisting MM due to the presence of MDEs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, such patients with AL amyloidosis without clinical myeloma who have a higher plasma cell burden (&ge;10 percent) should be managed more intensively than their low tumor burden counterparts. Although typical myeloma regimens are often not well tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis, induction and maintenance strategies should be considered for those who meet the current criteria for coexistent myeloma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143177\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664672\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation in AL amyloidosis depends on the number and nature of the organs affected. In some patients only one organ is affected, while in others there is extensive multi-system involvement. However, even in patients with more than one organ affected, it is usually possible to identify one organ as the &quot;dominant&quot; site of involvement. A more complete overview of the clinical manifestations of amyloidosis in general can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Non-specific systemic symptoms, including fatigue and unintentional weight loss, are common in patients with AL amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other common clinical presentations of AL amyloidosis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nephrotic syndrome</strong> &ndash; Renal involvement occurs in approximately 70 percent of patients and most often presents as asymptomatic proteinuria or clinically apparent nephrotic syndrome (50 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Restrictive cardiomyopathy</strong> &ndash; Cardiac involvement is seen in approximately 60 percent of patients and is typically characterized by thickening of the interventricular septum and ventricular wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64330\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64330 \">movie 1</a>). This can lead to systolic or diastolic dysfunction and the symptoms of heart failure. Other manifestations that can occur include sudden death or syncope due to arrhythmia or heart block, and rarely angina or infarction due to accumulation of amyloid in the coronary arteries. Elevations in N-terminal serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with AL amyloidosis are seen before the onset of clinical heart failure and are a marker of cardiac involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-amyloid-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Mixed sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy (20 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic neuropathy (15 percent) is a prominent feature in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms of numbness, paresthesia, and pain are frequently noted, as in peripheral neuropathy of many other causes. Compression of peripheral nerves, especially the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, can cause more localized sensory changes. Symptoms of bowel or bladder dysfunction and findings of orthostatic hypotension may be due to autonomic nervous system damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting peripheral nerve and muscle&quot;, section on 'Association with plasma cell dyscrasias'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatomegaly, with elevated liver enzyme levels</strong> &ndash; Hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly is seen in as many as 70 percent of patients. A cholestatic pattern with elevated liver enzymes is seen in approximately 25 percent. Clinical gastrointestinal involvement appears to be less common than in other forms of amyloidosis, with clinically apparent disease occurring in only 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because amyloidosis is a systemic disease, rates of positive gastrointestinal biopsies are much higher; in days past, rectal biopsy was considered a safe and simple method of diagnosing systemic amyloidosis with a sensitivity of 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For symptomatic patients potential gastrointestinal manifestations include bleeding (due to vascular fragility and loss of vasomotor responses to injury), gastroparesis, constipation, bacterial overgrowth, malabsorption, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction resulting from dysmotility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-amyloidosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal amyloidosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macroglossia and involvement of other muscles</strong> &ndash; Amyloid infiltration of skeletal muscles may cause visible enlargement (ie, pseudohypertrophy). A large tongue (ie, macroglossia), or lateral scalloping of the tongue from impingement on the teeth, is characteristic of AL amyloidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79126\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79126 \">picture 1</a>). Arthropathy may be due to amyloid deposition in joints and surrounding structures. The &quot;shoulder pad&quot; sign is visible enlargement of the anterior shoulder due to fluid in the glenohumeral joint <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amyloid infiltration of the synovial membrane and surrounding structures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-amyloidosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal manifestations of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Muscle involvement in AL amyloid'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purpura and other skin manifestations</strong> &ndash; Purpura, characteristically elicited in a periorbital distribution (raccoon eyes) by a Valsalva maneuver or minor trauma, is present in only a minority of patients, but is highly characteristic of AL amyloidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51684\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51684 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other signs of skin involvement include waxy thickening, easy bruising (ecchymoses) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69541\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69541 \">picture 3</a>), and subcutaneous nodules or plaques. Infiltration of the subcutaneous fat is generally asymptomatic but provides a convenient site for biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bleeding diathesis </strong>&ndash; Amyloidosis may be directly associated with a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. In one report of 337 patients, abnormal bleeding and abnormal coagulation tests were seen in 28 and 51 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Proposed mechanisms include factor X deficiency due to binding to amyloid fibrils primarily in the liver and spleen; decreased synthesis of coagulation factors in patients with advanced liver disease; and acquired von Willebrand disease. However, some patients with abnormal bleeding have no abnormality in any coagulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

IgM-related AL amyloidosis appears to be a distinct clinical entity with less cardiac involvement and a higher incidence of lymph node and soft tissue involvement (eg, liver damage, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy) when compared with non-IgM-related AL amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Amyloidosis'</a>.)</p><p>In the largest retrospective study, 131 of 250 patients with IgM-associated systemic AL amyloidosis had a clearly identified lymphoproliferative disorder, 39 of which predated the amyloidosis diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The most common identified conditions were lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, not specifically classified.

The largest single center retrospective case series of 3955 patients with Ig light chain amyloidosis identified 53 patients (1.3 percent) with a serum IgD monoclonal protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When compared with non-IgD AL amyloidosis, patients appeared to have a lower frequency of renal and cardiac involvement. At the time of presentation, the most common signs and symptoms were fatigue (60 percent), lower extremity edema (43 percent), paresthesias (32 percent), weight loss (32 percent), dyspnea on exertion (28 percent), and carpal tunnel syndrome (26 percent).

We suggest initial evaluation with an abdominal fat pad aspirate and bone marrow biopsy because of their ease, convenience, and high yield. Either or both are positive in 90 percent of patients with AL amyloidosis. If AL amyloidosis is still suspected in the setting of negative fat pad aspirate and bone marrow biopsy, then the affected organ should be biopsied.</p><p>The choice of initial biopsy site must take into consideration the expected yield, accessibility of the site, and the risks associated with the procedure. Kidney or liver biopsy is positive in over 90 percent of cases; however, a high success rate can also be achieved by less invasive procedures, such as abdominal fat pad aspirate (60 to 80 percent), rectal biopsy (50 to 70 percent), bone marrow biopsy (50 to 55 percent), or skin biopsy (50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis/abstract/3,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24-26</a>]. &#160;</p><p>We do not perform gingival biopsy because it is uncomfortable for the patient, and skin biopsies are generally negative unless there is clinical involvement or if a considerable amount of fat is taken with the skin.

Less frequently, liver involvement can occur with hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction, either alone or in combination with renal involvement. Rarely, LCDD may involve the heart and lead to cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Patients may progress to overt multiple myeloma; some patients may have coexisting multiple myeloma at initial diagnosis. Unlike AL amyloidosis, LCDD does not stain with Congo red.

AL amyloidosis (previously called primary amyloidosis) is a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder in which fibrils of monoclonal light chains are deposited in the kidneys, heart, and other tissues. Affected patients may have AL amyloidosis alone or in association with other plasma cell dyscrasias (multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia). (See <a href=\"#H143697\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation in AL amyloidosis depends on the number and nature of the organs affected. Non-specific systemic symptoms, including fatigue and unintentional weight loss, are common. Other common clinical presentations include nephrotic syndrome, restrictive cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatomegaly with elevated liver enzymes. Other less common but suggestive signs are macroglossia, purpura, and an unexplained bleeding diathesis. (See <a href=\"#H1664672\" class=\"local\">'Systemic presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires a biopsy. An abdominal fat pad aspirate and bone marrow biopsy are the preferred sites to biopsy in patients with suspected AL amyloidosis due to the ease of access and safety of accessing these sites. Either or both are positive in 90 percent of patients with AL amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H1665772\" class=\"local\">'Tissue biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for systemic AL amyloidosis require the presence of <strong>all</strong> of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116385 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of an amyloid-related systemic syndrome (eg, renal, liver, heart, gastrointestinal tract or peripheral nerve involvement). (See <a href=\"#H1664672\" class=\"local\">'Systemic presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive amyloid staining by Congo red in any tissue (eg, fat aspirate, bone marrow or organ biopsy). (See <a href=\"#H1666055\" class=\"local\">'Identifying amyloid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence that the amyloid is light chain-related established by direct examination of the amyloid (eg, using mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis; note that immunohistochemistry results to type amyloid may be unreliable). (See <a href=\"#H1666063\" class=\"local\">'Determining the type of amyloid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder (eg, presence of a serum or urine M protein, abnormal serum free light chain ratio, or clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H2212928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Serum free light chains'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AL amyloidosis should be distinguished from other forms of amyloidosis, from localized amyloidosis, and from other types of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases (MIDD) because the clinical course and therapy are markedly different. Other forms of amyloidosis will demonstrate staining with Congo red (a characteristic of amyloid), but direct examination of the amyloid material will not reveal immunoglobulin light chains (as seen in AL amyloidosis). Other forms of MIDD will have evidence of a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder and many will demonstrate light chains in the serum. However, AL amyloidosis is the only MIDD that will demonstrate staining with Congo red.
