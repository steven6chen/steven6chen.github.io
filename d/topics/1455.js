Using your inhaler correctly delivers the medication to your lungs, where it can work to control your symptoms. Using an inhaler incorrectly means that little or no medicine reaches the lungs.</p><p>Studies have shown that almost everyone can learn proper inhaler technique with adequate training and practice. This article discusses how to use a metered dose inhaler for adults. A separate article discusses inhaler use in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other topics about asthma are available separately.

Each type has advantages and disadvantages. The techniques for using the various MDIs and DPIs are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">METERED DOSE ASTHMA INHALERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are used to deliver a variety of inhaled medications, including quick relief bronchodilators such as albuterol, Proventil, Ventolin, and controller medicines such as glucocorticoids (Flovent HFA, QVAR, and others). You deliver the medication by pushing down on the canister (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61575 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HFA inhalers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metered dose inhaler canister contains the medicine and other products that help to deliver the medicine to the lungs. The chemical used to deliver medication in most metered dose inhalers was changed to hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) in about 2008. Previously, inhalers contained a chemical (chlorofluorocarbon) that is known to damage the ozone layer.</p><p>HFA devices may have a different taste compared to the previous inhalers, and the spray may feel softer. However, this does not mean the medicine is not reaching your lungs.</p><p>HFA inhalers need to be primed before being used the first time and cleaned to prevent medication build up and blockage. Each manufacturer will provide instructions about how to use their inhaler. These instructions should be reviewed carefully. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'How to use a metered dose inhaler'</a> below.)</p><p>HFA inhalers may be more expensive than the older inhaler. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have difficulty paying for your medications because assistance programs may be available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">How to use a metered dose inhaler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each inhaler manufacturer has specific instructions for using their inhaler; the following are general instructions.</p><p>When using a metered dose inhaler <strong>FOR THE FIRST TIME</strong> (with or without a spacer), prime the inhaler first:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the inhaler for five seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press down the canister with the index finger to release the medication. Hold the inhaler away from your face to prevent medication from getting into your eyes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait a few seconds, shake the inhaler, and press the canister down again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat the last step two more times (for a total of four times).</p><p/><p>After an inhaler is used for the first time, it does not need to be primed again unless you do not use it for two weeks or more.</p><p>Instructions for using the inhaler are available in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F93619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93619 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72362 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Getting the most out of your inhaler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several common mistakes can prevent inhaled medications from getting to the lungs. The following tips can help to get the most out of a metered dose inhaler.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remember to take the cap off the mouthpiece</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be sure there is medication in the canister (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Determine when an inhaler is empty'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhale through the mouth when breathing in the medication, not the nose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your tongue under the mouthpiece so that it does not block the opening of the mouthpiece</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a slow, deep breath at the same time you press down on the medication canister</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold your breath for as long as comfortable (5 to 10 seconds) and then exhale</p><p/><p>If you have difficulty timing your breath while spraying the medication, the dry powder inhalers release the medication when you take a breath. Another alternative is to use a spacer with your MDI or HFA inhaler. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Spacer devices'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dry powder asthma inhalers'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleaning the metered dose inhaler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HFA inhalers must be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent medication build up and blockages. Most manufacturers recommend cleaning the mouthpiece at least once per week. To clean:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the medication canister and cap from the mouthpiece. Do not wash the canister or immerse it in water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run warm tap water through the top and bottom of the plastic mouthpiece for 30 to 60 seconds. Use a soft cloth to remove any crusting of medication around the pinhole in the plastic mouthpiece.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake off excess water and allow the mouthpiece to dry completely (overnight is recommended). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you need the inhaler before the mouthpiece is dry, shake off excess water, replace canister, and test spray two times (away from the face).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Spacer devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spacer device holds the medicine in a chamber after you press the canister, allowing you to inhale slowly and deeply once or twice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). Spacers can dramatically decrease the amount of medicine deposited in the back of the mouth or on the tongue, allowing much more of the medicine to reach the lungs. HFA inhalers do not usually require a spacer, although a spacer may be recommended if you have difficulty timing the spray with inhalation.</p><p>There are many spacers on the market, although little is known about the benefit of one type versus another. In general, larger-sized spacers appear to be more effective than smaller ones. Proper technique and frequent cleaning are important to ensure optimal drug delivery. Be sure to read the package insert that comes with the spacer for specific directions about cleaning and use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cleaning the spacer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the powder residue that is deposited in the chamber is not harmful, the spacer should be cleaned periodically, approximately every one to two weeks. Wash the spacer with a dilute solution of warm water and dishwashing detergent; washing with water alone causes an electrostatic charge to develop, reducing the effectiveness of the spacer. After washing, air-dry the spacer before the next use. The spacer should NOT be wiped dry with a towel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine when an inhaler is empty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not always possible to determine when your inhaler is empty by shaking it; even when the medication is gone, some propellant remains in the canister. Several inhalers now have dose counters to track the amount of medication used, including Ventolin-HFA and Proventil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69302 \">picture 3</a>). Ask your healthcare provider if a counter is available on your inhaler.</p><p>If your inhaler does not have a counter but you use it on a regular basis (eg, two puffs twice per day), you will need a refill in 30 days. Write the date you will need the refill on the canister in permanent marker, and mark this date on your calendar or planner.</p><p>If you use your rescue inhaler infrequently, write the date you start using it on the canister in permanent marker and consider refilling it after three to four months, or sooner if you think it is no longer effective. The inhaler should not be used past its expiration date.</p><p>Another option is to check the package insert to determine the number of puffs or sprays available in the inhaler. You can then divide that number by the average number of puffs you use each month. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you use about eight puffs each week, divide 200 by 8 = 25 weeks (about 5 months)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Write the date you will need a refill on the canister in permanent marker, and mark this date on your calendar or planner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refill your inhaler prescription at least one or two weeks before you will need it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be aware, however, that you may need a refill sooner if you use your inhaler more frequently</p><p/><p>In the past, you may have been told to drop the canister into a bowl of water and see how it floats. However, this method is not reliable and it is no longer recommended. Spraying the inhaler is also not recommended because an inhaler can produce a spray without medication when beyond the specified number of drug doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DRY POWDER ASTHMA INHALERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) contain a dose of asthma medication in a dry powder form. DPIs deliver a fine powder to the lungs when the patient breathes in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67084\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67084 \">picture 4</a>). With a DPI, you do not need to coordinate pressing the canister with inhaling. However, you must inhale more forcefully with a DPI than with a traditional inhaler. Thus, DPIs may not be suitable for elderly people or people with nerve or muscle weakness. Also, it is important not to blow (exhale) directly into the device before breathing in, as this can scatter the medicine before it can be inhaled.</p><p>Examples of DPIs include the quick relief medication Proair RespiClick, the controller medications Asmanex, Flovent, Arnuity, and Pulmicort Flexhaler, and the combination inhalers Advair, Breo and Symbicort (available as a dry powder outside the United States). </p><p>Spiriva is a DPI that contains a long acting medication to treat people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is occasionally used for treatment of patients with severe asthma. </p><p>DPIs come in two main types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67084\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67084 \">picture 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple dose devices, which contain up to 200 doses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single dose devices (Foradil Aerolizer, Spiriva Handihaler), which require you to place a capsule in the device immediately before each treatment. DPI capsules should NOT be swallowed.</p><p/><p>DPIs do not contain chlorofluorocarbon&nbsp;(CFC) or hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), but some contain small amounts of lactose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">How to use a DPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instructions for using a DPI depend upon the individual type and brand. The following are general instructions. Consult the package insert with your device for specific instructions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the cap. For single use devices, load a capsule into the device as directed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out slowly and completely (not into the mouthpiece).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the mouthpiece between the front teeth and seal the lips around it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe in through the mouth quickly and deeply over two to three seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the inhaler from the mouth. Hold your breath for as long as possible (4 to 10 seconds).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out slowly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleaning the DPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most DPIs should NOT be washed with soap and water. The mouthpiece can be cleaned with a dry cloth. Consult the instructions with your inhaler for further information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA ATTACK CARE AND PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Work with your healthcare provider to ensure that your medication regimen is working to prevent and treat asthma attacks.</p><p>Depending upon the severity of your asthma, your treatment plan may include regular visits with your provider, one or more medications, avoiding asthma triggers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> home peak flow monitoring. At each visit, you should show your clinician how you use an inhaler to be sure that you are using the correct technique.
