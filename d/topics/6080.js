The concept was based upon many years of experience treating hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation in patients with and without portal hypertension. EVL works by capturing all or part of a varix resulting in occlusion from thrombosis. The tissue then necroses and sloughs off in a few days to weeks, leaving a superficial mucosal ulceration, which rapidly heals. EVL avoids the use of sclerosant and thus eliminates the deep damage to the esophageal wall that occurs after ES. Collateral vessels near the cardia decrease after EVL and EVL may promote the development of deep gastric collaterals. These factors may also contribute to the effectiveness of EVL for preventing further variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Another interesting finding is that during acute variceal bleeding, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (which correlates with the risk of variceal bleeding) increases after ES, but not after EVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The first patient was treated with EVL in 1986. Since then, advances in the technique have led to its routine use in the care of patients with esophageal varices. One of the biggest advances was the development of the multiple band ligator (Saeed Six-Shooter and Speedbander), which has simplified and improved the safety of EVL.</p><p>The technical considerations involved in EVL and the data supporting its technical efficacy will be reviewed here. The role of EVL in the care of patients with varices is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic variceal ligating devices are placed on the tip of standard endoscopes. The device has a soft sheath potion that fits over the tip of the endoscope and a hard plastic portion. Bands are stretched over the hard portion at the distal end of the device and later deployed onto the varices. Currently available devices are designed for standard and therapeutic sized endoscopes.</p><p>The procedure begins after a thorough upper endoscopy to identify the esophageal varices that are to be treated. Actively bleeding varices or those with stigmata indicating recent bleeding (such as a fibrin plug or a &quot;red wale&quot; sign) should be primary targets even if they are not located at the gastroesophageal junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53168%7EGAST%2F50222\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53168 graphicRef50222 \">picture 1A-B</a>). There are no absolute restrictions on coagulation parameters that preclude performing EVL, although in patients with active bleeding, attempts should be made to improve the coagulation status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It is helpful to measure the distance of the gastroesophageal junction and the varices from the incisors before beginning band ligation, since visibility may be reduced once the banding device is placed over the tip of the endoscope and the predetermined measurements help provide landmarks. Following upper endoscopy, the endoscope has to be removed from the patient to load the banding device onto the endoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Placement of an overtube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The original banding device (Stiegmann-Goff ligator) requires the use of an overtube because the endoscope needs to be removed, reloaded, and repassed after each band is deployed, which is much easier with the overtube in the patient's esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The overtube can either be backloaded onto the endoscope before esophageal intubation and then advanced using the shaft of the endoscope as a guide, or passed separately after the initial examination over a Maloney dilator.</p><p>The advantage of backloading the overtube is that it eliminates one intubation. A potential disadvantage is that the overtube may pinch the upper esophageal mucosa during insertion since it is larger in diameter than the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This can result in the tearing or perforation of the proximal esophagus. This complication can be avoided by loading the overtube on a 44 F Maloney dilator, which completely fills the lumen of the overtube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of the Maloney dilator makes passage of the overtube easier in some patients; thus, it should be used in any patient in whom an overtube that has been backloaded does not pass easily.</p><p>The multiple band ligating systems have made use of the overtube less necessary, since 4 to 10 bands can be deployed without having to remove the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This is helpful in patients who are receiving follow-up treatment for known varices. However, for acutely bleeding patients, the overtube still offers advantages that need to be considered, even when one uses the multiple ligating device. In particular, an overtube helps protect against aspiration. This is most important in massively bleeding patients who are sedated and thus at increased risk. Aspiration pneumonia is a serious complication of variceal bleeding that contributes to mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Applying the bands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the endoscope and the ligating device are reinserted into the esophagus, the site for placement needs to be identified. It is best to treat the most distal varices and then ascend proximally in the esophagus, since deployed bands partially occlude the esophageal lumen. Bands are usually applied in a circumferential pattern spiraling gradually up the esophagus until all major columns of varices have one to three bands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54194\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54194 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>When applying suction to draw the mucosa into the chamber at the tip of the endoscope created by the banding device, it is important to try to get a &quot;red-out&quot; (caused by close approximation of the mucosa overlying the varix within the ligating chamber to the lens on the tip of the endoscope), indicating that an adequate amount of tissue has been captured by the device. Maximum wall suction is sufficient to achieve adequate aspiration of the esophageal mucosa; some portable suction devices are insufficient. Trying to place a band on a small amount of tissue will usually result in the band sliding off; it may also cause some mucosal damage with subsequent bleeding that can compromise visualization of the mucosa.</p><p>Complete red-out may not always be possible with the new large multiple ligators, which have a longer chamber at the tip of the endoscope. As bands are applied to the mucosa, less tissue is available to aspirate. This should indicate that another, perhaps more proximal, site needs to be selected for the next application.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of bands to apply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is usually the goal to eradicate varices in the lower 5 cm of the esophagus. However, there is theoretically no limit to the number of bands that can be applied or the most proximal location in the esophagus where it is safe to apply them. Six to 10 bands are commonly used during the initial session. Fewer are usually required during subsequent sessions. However, a randomized, prospective study found that placement of more than six bands per session did not improve patient outcomes but prolonged procedure time and increased the number of misfired bands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasogastric tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We avoid placing a nasogastric tube after EVL to avoid dislodging the bands. However, studies addressing this are lacking. While a nasogastric tube does not necessarily need to be passed after treatment for monitoring, if there is a need to keep the stomach decompressed or provide medications or nutrition enterally, a tube can be passed at any time following band placement, though it should be placed as gently as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPLE LIGATING DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited controlled data on the multiple ligating devices, but there is a host of anecdotal experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/12,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-16</a>]. Band deployment and visibility during endoscopy are similar to the original single ligating device. However, the increased length of the device on the tip of the endoscope increases the nonflexible tip length, which can make passage into the esophagus more difficult in some patients. This problem can be overcome by using an overtube.</p><p>Three companies are producing ligating devices for treating esophageal varices: Conmed (Stiegmann-Goff Endoscopic Ligator and the Clearvue Endoscopic Ligator), Boston-Scientific (SpeedBand SuperView Super 7), and Wilson-Cook (4, 6, and 10 Shooter Saeed Multi-Band Ligators). No clinical studies have been performed to assess the relative efficacy of these devices compared with one another. The multiple ligators come with different numbers of bands currently ranging from 4 to 10. The choice of which to use depends on the situation; more bands are required for acutely bleeding patients than for those undergoing elective re-banding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTELY BLEEDING VARICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ligating devices in the acutely bleeding patient may be limited in patients with severe bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Diminished visibility created by blood accumulating in the tip of the device, and the tunnel vision produced by the ligating device on the tip of the endoscope can make EVL challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The accumulation of blood can often be overcome by injecting water through a blunt needle passed along the trip wire as it exits from the valve on the endoscope handle. The tunnel vision problem has been ameliorated by the newer ligating devices, which are made of clear plastic.</p><p>An advantage to EVL in active bleeding is that it is not imperative that a band be applied over a varix, since capturing tissue without a varix in it will not cause any harm. This is in contrast to the situation with endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES), where it is mandatory to place the sclerosant intravariceal to achieve maximal effectiveness and to avoid complications. Paravariceal injection produces considerable tissue damage and thus should be done only with small amounts of dilute sclerosant.</p><p>In most actively bleeding patients, it is possible to semi-blindly place bands at the gastroesophageal junction, which reduces bleeding. More directed placement can be accomplished once the field clears. This avoids repeated blind attempts at injecting a suspected bleeding site with sclerosant, which is a cause of significant complications from ES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of investigators have reported their experience with the control of active bleeding using EVL and ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. Considering these data together, EVL controls bleeding in approximately 80 to 100 percent of patients and has equal or slightly better efficacy than ES in achieving hemostasis (86 versus 77 percent in one trial) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50127 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>We exclusively use EVL for acutely bleeding patients with virtually 100 percent control of bleeding. Child's C patients or patients with elevated Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores appear to be less responsive than either A or B patients to EVL therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition, some data suggest that patients presenting with their first variceal bleed while already taking a nonselective beta blocker are at increased risk for rebleeding and death compared with those not on a nonselective beta blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There are also data to support the use of medical therapy after initial banding to reduce the risk of rebleeding, but this does not improve overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Variceal recurrence after EVL may be predicted by endoscopic ultrasound findings. Recurrences have been associated with severe or multiple peri-esophageal collateral veins and the presence of perforating veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Another study noted that along with other factors (such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or large varices with red signs [wale marks]), ultrasound-identified portosystemic collaterals were associated with early rebleeding after EVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP BAND LIGATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with sclerotherapy, endoscopic variceal ligation requires multiple sessions to eradicate varices. We repeat EVL within 7 to 10 days due to our unreported experience with early rebleeding if the procedure was done later. However, there is limited published experience to support the timing interval. A study from Japan with a total of 63 patients suggested that follow-up sessions every two months were similar, if not numerically better, than every two-week follow-up sessions in achieving eradication and control of rebleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The majority of rebleeding occurs in the interval between the initial endoscopic therapeutic session and the time when variceal obliteration is achieved. Part of the benefit seen with EVL compared with endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES) may be related to the more rapid achievement of variceal obliteration. The average time to obliteration is approximately 3.7 sessions with EVL and 4.9 sessions with EST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/21-26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26,36</a>]. Rebleeding after elective EVL appears to be considerably lower than after emergent EVL (0.5 versus 7.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>EVL can be performed in patients who have undergone prior ES, although it may be more difficult if there is extensive esophageal mucosal damage. The mucosa in this situation will not aspirate well into the EVL device, possibly making it difficult to place the bands. Despite this concern, patients who continue to bleed following ES can generally be rescued with EVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>At the second session, bands can be applied as needed to any persistent varices. There is no need to be concerned about placing them close to an ulcer from a band that has fallen off. This is in contrast to the situation with ES in which injection near an ulcer can increase complications.</p><p>The patient should have repeat endoscopy every <strong>two weeks</strong> after the initial two sessions with band applications as needed until there are no varices left to treat. This approach was validated by a Scandinavian study that found rebleeding rates of 2.3 percent at 6 months, 3.4 percent at 12 months, and 4.6 percent at 2 years when banding was repeated at two-week intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>After apparent eradication is achieved, we suggest a repeat examination in one month, followed by an examination every three months for six to nine months. If the patient is still free of varices or only needs an occasional band or two, the interval can be increased to 6 to 12 months, depending upon the rate and degree of variceal return. If the patient has small varices and it is difficult to aspirate the esophageal mucosa into the lumen of the ligating device due to submucosal scarring from prior treatment, a small amount of sclerosant (1 mL of 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanolamine-oleate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethanolamine oleate</a>) should be injected into the remaining varices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines regarding follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the <a href=\"http://www.giejournal.org/article/S0016-5107(13)02139-1/fulltext&amp;token=MlNN9OCsYkbjX/lZohcIftJvZsmWPKEJSF2k1VHNAeBYkFJVIEJKfIy8J5NPZ3UVxjUigO3w7EsEh6A6lPQyE9/WeVh7wKBoM4e1xygyxhQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1264\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy</a> have issued guidelines for management of variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

A meta-analysis concluded that four patients would need to be treated with ligation instead of sclerotherapy to avert one rebleeding episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A number of studies have compared mortality in patients treated with EVL or ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/20-23,25,26,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23,25,26,43</a>]. A meta-analysis that included five of these trials suggested that mortality after EVL was less than after ES (24 versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The authors estimated that 10 patients would need to be treated with EVL instead of ES to prevent one death. One possible reason for the improved survival after EVL compared to ES may be the lower rate of complications associated with EVL.</p><p>The efficacy of EVL or ES in preventing rebleeding compared with medical therapy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of EVL for preventing rebleeding is high, but the ultimate prognosis is poor if the patient is Child-Pugh class C, has a white blood count &gt;10,000, or has portal vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Also, factors that predict rebleeding are related to the severity of the patient's liver disease (ascites, severity of varices, and prolonged prothrombin time) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combining endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES) has been proposed to speed variceal eradication and reduce the likelihood of rebleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Furthermore, the addition of sclerotherapy may reduce the incidence of recurrent varices, which may be higher with EVL than ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Combination therapy has been evaluated in patients with esophageal and gastric fundal varices with variable success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/46,48-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48-70</a>]. Routine initial combination therapy is not indicated for esophageal varices. However, it is probably the best endoscopic method for treating gastric varices in the United States, because other means of controlling bleeding endoscopically (such as with glue injection) are not available. Using ES to treat small remnant varices after EVL has been shown to not add any efficacy to EVL alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several variations in the types of sclerosants and the protocol for administering ES in combination with EVL have been described. As an example, one technique involves injection of 1 mL of 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanolamine-oleate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethanolamine oleate</a> into each visible varix above EVL sites during the initial session. Subsequent sessions are performed at the same time intervals as for EVL alone, but both procedures are done as indicated by the findings at each endoscopy. Another study involving a small number of patients suggested that better results might be obtained by placing a band near the GE junction followed by injection of sclerosant in the varix proximally and then ligating again just above the injection site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies evaluating combination therapy for esophageal varices have produced heterogeneous results, depending in part upon the population that is studied (ie, active bleeding versus prior bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/48-66,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-66,72</a>]. A randomized trial of 47 patients with active variceal bleeding found that ES combined with EVL conferred no benefit over EVL alone in terms of control of bleeding (75 versus 100 percent with EVL alone), rebleeding rate (36 versus 25 percent), or varix recurrence (23 versus 16 percent); however, combination therapy was associated with a higher complication rate, such as deep ulcers (65 versus 20 percent), and dysphagia (30 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>In another prospective trial 72 patients with a history of variceal bleeding received EVL until the varices disappeared or only residual small varices remained; the patients were then randomized to sclerotherapy or no further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Sclerotherapy was performed using an even mixture of 50 percent dextrose and 3 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-tetradecyl-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium tetradecyl sulfate</a> injected in 0.5 mL aliquots (4 to 8 mL) into random sites in the distal 3 cm of the esophagus when varices were not seen or into residual small varices. If varices were still visible after a session, then a second session was performed three weeks later. Endoscopy was performed every three months to assess for recurrence of varices, which were treated with repeat band ligation. After a mean follow-up of two years, recurrent esophageal varices and variceal bleeding were significantly less common in patients treated with combined therapy (14 versus 43 percent and 8 versus 31 percent, respectively).

No statistically significant differences were found between the ligation therapy and combination therapy groups in variceal eradication rates, hemostatic effects of active bleeding, rebleeding rates during active treatment, or recurrence rates. However, patients receiving combination therapy required significantly fewer sessions to achieve variceal eradications (4.5 versus 2.1) and experienced significantly less chest pain during and after the procedure. A controlled trial from Italy suggested that APC following EVL may reduce the incidence of recurrent variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

These ulcers are limited to the mucosa unlike sclerotherapy-related ulcers, which are often deeper and are thus prone to causing mediastinal inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophageal wall scarring. Significant bleeding from postligation ulcers is rare. If these ulcers do bleed, however, standard endoscopic methods for controlling ulcer bleeding are usually effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two cases have now been reported in which total esophageal obstruction has occurred after EVL. The latest case was monitored, and the obstruction resolved spontaneously in about seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Overtube complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the complications related to EVL have been due to placement of the overtube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/10,11,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,93,94</a>]. The overtube can traumatize the mucosa in the esophagus at the overtube's distal end, which can rarely lead to perforation. The mechanism of upper esophageal perforation is not completely understood. It is probably due to one or more factors including shear forces from passing the tube, stretching forces from the cross-sectional size of the tube, and pinching (tearing) due to trapping mucosa in the space between the overtube and the endoscope.</p><p>As discussed above, an overtube is not always necessary when using multiple band ligating devices. Furthermore, since its initial introduction, the overtube has been shortened by 5 cm and its tip tapered to reduce trauma and make introduction easier. The benefit of these modifications was confirmed in a study that compared trauma with the new and old overtubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Although proximal esophageal mucosal injury occurred in approximately 80 percent of patients with either the new or the old overtube, the injuries were all mild with the new overtube, while 20 percent were severe with the old overtube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal ulcerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcerations occur in the esophageal mucosa after all successful ligations. However, ulcers following EVL are less severe than with ES. This was illustrated in a study that found EVL ulcers were shallower than those associated with ES ulcers (0.6 versus 1.8 mm) and healed more quickly (14 versus 21 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In another report, 60 percent of EVL ulcers healed at the end of two weeks and 100 percent healed by three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Ulcers caused by EVL are usually approximately 1 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/82,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,95</a>]. They typically develop within 3 to 10 days after EVL, when the necrotic tissue within the band sloughs off. No empiric therapy with acid-suppressing drugs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> has been shown to reliably minimize the effects or presence of these ulcers. Previous variceal bleeding, esophagitis, high platelet ratio index (APRI) score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-aspartate-aminotransferase-ast-to-platelet-ratio-index-apri\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), and low prothrombin index are independent risk factors for bleeding from post EVL ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A concern with both EVL and ES has been the potential to worsen portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), which could result in bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The exacerbation of PHG may be related to increased gastric blood flow or to increased mucosal congestion following eradication of esophageal varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p>The development of PHG may be more common with EVL than ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, PHG related to EVL may have fewer long-term sequelae. In most reports, a return to baseline occurred more rapidly in patients who developed PHG as a result of EVL compared to ES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/97,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,100,101</a>].

After eradication, 12 patients experienced a reduction in portal pressure while 10 had an elevation. Three patients developed fundal varices while gastropathy worsened in nine patients. The initial portal pressure gradient in these patients was not different from those who did not develop new fundal varices or gastropathy. Furthermore, there was no worsening of portal pressure gradients in these patients.

Examples include local esophageal wall necrosis and perforation, esophageal perforation after EVL and balloon tamponade, excessive bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, mesenteric vein thrombosis, inadvertent banding of laryngeal mucosa, pyogenic meningitis, esophageal stenosis, altered esophageal motility, paraplegia, and decreased oxygen delivery (suspected to be due to decreased cardiac output from a decreased preload).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study investigating the relative costs of EVL versus ES found them to be comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-variceal-ligation/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. However, the data included a number of observations that have not been consistently observed in other studies such as equal rebleeding rates, achievement of obliteration, hospital length of stay, blood transfusion requirement, shunt requirements and survival.

The tissue then necroses and sloughs off in a few days to weeks, leaving a superficial mucosal ulceration, which rapidly heals. EVL avoids the use of sclerosant and thus eliminates the deep damage to the esophageal wall that occurs after endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EVL controls bleeding in approximately 80 to 100 percent of patients and has equal or slightly better efficacy than ES in achieving hemostasis.
