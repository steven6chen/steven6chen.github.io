This skin is called the &quot;foreskin.&quot; It protects the tip of the penis. When a baby boy is circumcised, it means he had a procedure to remove the foreskin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74651\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74651 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>After birth, a baby boy's foreskin is stuck in place and can't be pulled back over the tip of the penis. This is normal. Over time, the foreskin will loosen up. But it can take years until the foreskin can be pulled back completely over the tip of the penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1707329\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I take care of my son's uncircumcised penis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Until your baby is 6 months old, do <strong>not</strong> try to pull the foreskin back over the penis. Instead, to take care of your baby's penis, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash it during bath time with a gentle, nonirritating soap</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your baby's diaper often so that he doesn't get a diaper rash</p><p/><p>After your baby is 6 months old, you can start to gently pull back on the foreskin when you clean the penis. It's important to pull the foreskin back only as far as it goes and not force it any further. As you pull the foreskin back, gently clean and then dry the skin underneath. When you are done, make sure to return the foreskin to its normal place so that it covers the tip of the penis.</p><p>When your son is older and can clean himself, you can teach him how to take care of his foreskin and penis. Each time he cleans himself, he should pull the foreskin back, clean and dry the skin underneath, and then return it to its normal place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1707336\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen in an uncircumcised penis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can happen.
