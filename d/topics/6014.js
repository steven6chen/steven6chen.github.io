They can then get stuck in and block off small blood vessels. This can cause organ damage and symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951742\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes endocarditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis is usually caused by bacteria. It can happen when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People have an infection in another part of the body. The bacteria from that infection can travel through the blood to the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria enter the body through the skin or mouth, and then travel through the blood to the heart. This can happen during dental surgery, or if people have a catheter (a thin tube that goes into a vein) for a long time. It can also happen if people inject drugs into their vein.</p><p/><p>Many people who get endocarditis already have a heart problem or have had heart valve surgery in the past.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951749\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of endocarditis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis usually causes a fever and chills.</p><p>If the endocarditis has caused problems with the heart or other organs, people can have other symptoms, too. For example, people who have heart failure can have trouble breathing, and swelling in their feet or legs. People who have kidney damage (from pieces of a growth that have broken off and traveled to the kidneys) can have red or brown urine.</p><p>If pieces of a growth travel to and block blood vessels in the brain, it can cause a stroke. A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. Symptoms of a stroke can include trouble speaking, or weakness or numbness in one or both arms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951756\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse if you have a fever that lasts for many days, especially if you have a heart condition. You should also tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of the other symptoms mentioned above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951763\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. During the exam, he or she will listen for a heart murmur, which is an extra sound in your heartbeat. A heart murmur is sometimes a sign of endocarditis.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will also probably do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, including a test called a &quot;blood culture&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ECG (also called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951770\"><span class=\"h1\">How is endocarditis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis is usually treated in the hospital with antibiotic medicines. These medicines go into your vein through a tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>In most cases, the antibiotic medicines get rid of the infection. But if they don't, or if your endocarditis has caused serious heart valve problems, you might need surgery. Surgery for endocarditis usually involves replacing your diseased heart valve with a heart valve that works normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951777\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent getting endocarditis again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After people have had endocarditis, they usually need to take antibiotics before they go to the dentist or have certain procedures. Taking antibiotics beforehand can help prevent getting another infection. Ask your doctor or nurse if you need to take antibiotics before those times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194951850\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
