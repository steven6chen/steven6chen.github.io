Management of minor wounds has two goals: hemostasis and achievement of a functional scar that is cosmetically acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Suturing is the most common method of wound closure for minor lacerations; stapling and tissue adhesives (eg, Dermabond) are acceptable alternatives. </p><p>The use of staples for wound closure is reviewed here. Wound preparation and other wound closure methods and the assessment and management of scalp lacerations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound repair with tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-scalp-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of scalp lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many minor wounds, suturing is the standard method of closure. Staples are an acceptable alternative for linear lacerations through the dermis that have straight, sharp edges and are located on the scalp, trunk, arms, and legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The table describes key aspects of wounds that impact the selection of a wound closure method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Scalp lacerations are particularly suitable for closure with staples. For these injuries, randomized trials suggest that closure of scalp wounds with staples is faster and less costly than with similar infection rates, healing time, and cosmetic outcomes when compared to sutures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-scalp-lacerations#H4199768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of scalp lacerations&quot;, section on 'Surgical staples'</a>.)</p><p>Because staples can be placed more rapidly than can sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], they are especially useful in mass casualty situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In such situations, staples may be safer because the risk of accidental needle-stick injury is eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because staples do not permit meticulous cosmetic repair, the clinician should avoid staple use on the face or neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Also, discomfort makes staples a poor choice for wound closure in the hands or feet. Staples should not be used in patients who may require computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging as part of their acute care because they produce scan artifacts and may be avulsed by the powerful magnetic field.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local anesthesia using topical agents (eg, lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine [LET] gel) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infiltrative anesthesia (eg, buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) provides adequate pain control in most patients. In children, anxiety and pain response may often be decreased with distraction techniques and use of a child life specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'LET'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;, section on 'Lidocaine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound assessment and irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound irrigation, foreign body removal, and necrotic tissue debridement should occur prior to staple placement. Hair need not be removed prior to stapling. Lubrication to comb the hair away from wound margins or simple clipping with scissors is all that is necessary in most cases. Shaving to skin level increases the risk of infection and can leave small particles in the wound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Hair removal'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The preparation of a skin wound for closure is discussed in greater detail separately.

Eversion is necessary to avoid the tendency of the stapler to invert the edges of the wound, which can cause a less aesthetically pleasing scar. Eversion of the wound edges by an assistant may permit more accurate staple positioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the stapler firmly on the skin surface but without indenting the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Align the center mark on the stapler with the center of the wound margin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently squeeze the stapler handle to eject the staple into the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the stapler does not automatically release, then release the staple from the stapler by pulling the stapler back. When properly placed, the crossbar of the staple is elevated a few millimeters above the skin surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place staples about 0.5 to 1 cm apart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place enough staples to allow for proper apposition of the wound edges.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the wound is stapled, apply an antibiotic ointment to minimize dressing adherence, and either cover the wound with a sterile dressing (eg, leg, arm, and trunk wounds) or leave it open to the air (eg, scalp wounds). The patient may remove the dressing and gently clean the wound in 24 to 48 hours. The patient may then continue wound care until the staples are removed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply antibiotic ointment daily to the wound.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply a dressing to the wound, unless it was originally left open.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not soak the wound (eg, swimming, bathing), although showering is acceptable</p><p/><p>The interval between application and removal of the staple is the same as that for standard suture placement and removal, although healing is more rapid (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;, section on 'Suture removal'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp &ndash; 7 to 14 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trunk and upper extremities &ndash; 7 to 10 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremities &ndash; 10 to 14 days</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Staple removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure for staple removal is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114821 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position both prongs of the staple remover under the staple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depress the handle of the staple remover so that the staple is bent outward in the midline, easing it out of the skin.</p><p/><p>Some patients describe a pinching sensation during removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If the patient is following up elsewhere for staple removal, provide a staple remover to the patient to ensure that the follow-up provider has the proper equipment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications related to staple closure occur infrequently and at a rate that appears equivalent to that of sutured wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scarring</strong> &ndash; As with sutures, staples can cause scarring. In patients who scar easily, the scar that results from staples may be more pronounced than one produced by sutures, particularly if the staples are left in place for prolonged periods (&gt;5 to 15 days, depending upon the location) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficult removal</strong> &ndash; Embedding of the staples in the skin and rotation of the staples may lead to difficulty in removal. Proper depth and symmetry of initial staple placement, as well as timely removal, should avoid this problem in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For partially embedded staples, the remover can be placed as far under the staple as possible and toggled back and forth until the staple loosens. On occasion, it is easier to grasp and toggle the staple with a hemostat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rarely, staples may become completely lodged within the skin. In this situation, radiographs may be necessary to determine the orientation of the buried staple. After local anesthesia, an incision can be made over the buried staple so that removal can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wound dehiscence</strong> &ndash; Wound dehiscence may occur if hemostasis is not ensured prior to staple placement or if the wound is not apposed completely during closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.
