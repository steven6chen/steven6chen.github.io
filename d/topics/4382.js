Noninfectious and infectious complications of contact lenses are common and vary in severity from clinically inconsequential to potentially vision-threatening. In a survey of contact lens wearers in the United States, nearly one-third had experienced a contact lens-related condition that required a doctor's visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Primary care and emergency department clinicians are often the first to evaluate patients with contact lens&ndash;related problems. Although many of these conditions necessitate referral to an eye care specialist, familiarity with these complications by the frontline clinician will allow prompt diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate triage.</p><p>The presentation and management of complications associated with contact lenses will be reviewed here. An overview of contact lenses and specific microbial infections related to contact lens wear are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of contact lenses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fusarium-infection#H773301007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fusarium infection&quot;, section on 'Keratitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=free-living-amebas-and-prototheca#H13571795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Free-living amebas and Prototheca&quot;, section on 'Keratitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maintenance of a smooth and transparent anterior refractive surface is critical to good vision. A complex interplay between the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, the tear film, and the overlying eyelids provides protection against infection and scarring. Noninfectious complications are minimized with a well-fit contact lens that both rests on the pre-corneal tear film and moves only enough to allow good fluid and gas exchange, thereby functioning as a de facto extension of the ocular surface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1572295\"><span class=\"h2\">Dryness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact lens-related dryness is commonly encountered and is the most frequent reason for contact lens discontinuation. Dryness can be caused by poor tear film, oxygen deprivation, lens deposits, and contact lens solution incompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Treatment includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> with and without contact lenses, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> 0.05%, and management of blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction when applicable. Patients may benefit from using lubricant eye drops before and after contact lens wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], refitting with a higher oxygen permeable lens material, or switching contact lens care solutions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sterile corneal infiltrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple small infiltrates containing inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells) may accumulate within the collagen matrix of the corneal stroma in people who wear contact lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These infiltrates appear white and are located in the anterior stroma, usually in the peripheral cornea near the limbus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52402 \">picture 1</a>). They can occur singly or in clusters and are usually 0.1 to 1.0 mm in size. The infiltrates may be difficult to see without slit-lamp biomicroscopy.</p><p>Sterile infiltrates are usually asymptomatic but can cause pain, discomfort, tearing, or photophobia if they are severe or numerous. In many cases, the diagnosis is made during routine eye examination in contact lens wearers.</p><p>The infiltrates are believed to result from a number of insults associated with contact lens wear: accumulated debris, chemical toxicity, hypoxia, and hypersensitivity and overnight wear (extended wear). Risks factors include years of lens wear, use of multipurpose care products, silicone hydrogel lenses, patient age, and extended wear of lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p>The infiltrates may also represent an immune reaction to exotoxins from staphylococci colonizing the sebaceous gland openings of the eyelid margins (staphylococcal marginal keratitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;, section on 'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Ophthalmology consultation is appropriate to distinguish these infiltrates from infection and to initiate topical corticosteroids when indicated. Sterile infiltrates respond well to a short course of topical corticosteroids or, in many patients, temporary elimination of contact lens wear. Concomitant control of the ocular surface and eyelid bacterial flora over a course of weeks may also be beneficial. This may involve eyelid hygiene, topical antibiotics, or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg once or twice daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Corneal epithelial problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact lenses may cause defects of the corneal epithelium through mechanical trauma, oxygen deprivation, nutrient starvation, metabolic injury, hypersensitivity, drying, or chemical toxicity. Epithelial defects of the cornea can be seen by staining the eye with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye. The dye is taken up by discontinuity of the epithelial surface related to cell damage or death.</p><p>Mild staining of the epithelium is common, usually asymptomatic, and of little clinical consequence. Larger defects may cause pain, tearing, red eyes (conjunctival injection), photophobia, and blurred vision.</p><p>Superficial punctate staining of the epithelium may be caused by a poorly fit lens (eg, too steep or flat), hypoxia, chemical toxicity from storage or cleaning solutions, lens deposits, blepharitis, dry eyes, or desiccation from poor eyelid closure. Significant defects are usually the result of mechanical trauma in the form of an abrasion to the epithelial surface that is rendered more susceptible to denudation by the overall stress of contact lens wear.</p><p>Microcysts in the epithelial layer may result from pockets of dead cellular debris associated with hypoxia in extended wear contact lens users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These microcysts appear as small, scattered, white dots by slit-lamp biomicroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although treatment is not indicated in most patients, severe or persistent cases may necessitate switching to daily wear contact lenses or to eliminating contact lens wear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical corneal abrasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contact lens is essentially a foreign body that is retained in the eye for hours or weeks with repetitive pressing and sliding on the cornea with each blink. Mechanical abrasions can result from traumatic insertion and removal of the lens; tears, scratches, or chips in the lens; or foreign debris trapped under the lens. Abrasions are typically very painful because the superficial cornea is replete with sensory nerve endings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Corneal abrasions related to contact lens wear pose a risk for bacterial ulcerative keratitis. As a result, preventive therapy is indicated with antibiotics effective against <em>Pseudomonas</em>, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfacetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfacetamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> are not satisfactory choices because they do not provide adequate <em>Pseudomonas</em> coverage. The antibiotics should be provided as eye drops used four times daily. More frequent instillation may delay healing through toxic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Lens wear should be discontinued and the patient advised to use cold compresses and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management. Cycloplegia may also provide pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Close follow-up should be provided at 24 hours and through five days after the injury.</p><p>Patching should be <strong>avoided</strong>. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials of patients with simple corneal abrasions (less than 10 mm diameter and not all related to contact lens wear) found that patching did not hasten the epithelialization process or improve patient comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, patching worsens the condition if an apparent contact lens&ndash;related corneal abrasion actually represents an early <em>Pseudomonas</em> ulcer prior to development of clinically visible infectious infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoxic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cornea derives its oxygen by direct diffusion from the ocular surface. The presence of a contact lens, if not freely permeable to gas, may reduce access to oxygen. Hypoxia is worse at night under the closed eyelids in extended wear contact lens wearers.</p><p>Hypoxia results in microcystic edema and punctate staining of the corneal epithelium, stromal edema (manifested by a steamy, cloudy, and thickened cornea with striae or folds in Descemet's membrane), decreased visual acuity, photophobia, and conjunctival hyperemia. Chronic hypoxia may lead to superficial, and rarely deep, corneal neovascularization, especially at the superior limbus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients who experience contact lens-related hypoxia may benefit by switching to a higher oxygen permeable lens material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic and/or immune reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemicals in contact lens solutions may produce toxic or immune reactions on the corneal epithelium in susceptible individuals. Such reactions may result in severe, diffuse superficial punctate epitheliopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60904\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60904 \">picture 2</a>), frank epithelial erosion and defects, pseudodendrites, and conjunctival hyperemia. The multiple, small subepithelial corneal infiltrates resulting from chemical toxicity may be mistaken for viral infiltrates.</p><p>Preservatives, surfactant cleaning agents, and disinfecting chemicals have been implicated. The preservative thimerosal, now rarely used, was at one time frequently responsible for toxic and immune keratoconjunctivitis.</p><p>Undiluted enzyme cleaner and hydrogen peroxide disinfectant may cause a severe acute keratitis. Solutions with hydrogen peroxide may cause gas bubble formation in the epithelium and cause temporary loss of vision. Commercial multipurpose contact lens solutions contain more dilute concentrations of enzyme and hydrogen peroxide and are therefore safer than older preparations.</p><p>Central toxic keratopathy, seen in patients after refractive surgery, has been reported in patients after extended contact lens wear. Central toxic keratopathy is characterized by central corneal opacification, thinning, and hyperopic shift. Confocal microscopy shows edema and rearrangement of collagen fibrils with cellular infiltration and interspersed refractile elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A condition resembling superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] may be seen in some contact lens wearers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Classic SLK, associated with dry eye syndrome or autoimmune thyroid disease, presents as tearing, burning, a foreign body sensation, mild photophobia, and mucous discharge. There is a thickened, keratinized, and hyperemic superior bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51836 \">picture 3</a>). Rose-Bengal or lissamine green dye staining reveals superior corneal and conjunctival punctate staining. The central cornea is not involved. Superior filamentary keratitis and papillary keratopathy are also commonly seen.</p><p>Contact lens wear (almost exclusively with soft lenses) may result in many of the manifestations of SLK. However, filamentary keratitis is absent and the keratitis may extend to the central cornea, resulting in decreased visual acuity. The symptoms resolve upon cessation of contact lens wear, but the corneal and conjunctival changes may persist for months to years. Treatment consists of eliminating lens wear until the ocular surface returns to normal or switching to rigid gas-permeable lenses. Glucocorticoid treatment is of minimal benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tight lens syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact lenses normally ride on a layer of tears that allows adequate lens movement and oxygen diffusion. A lens that adheres too tightly to the corneal surface functions like a suction cup and may cause severe pain, blurred vision, redness, and photophobia. The contact lens is immobile and difficult to remove.</p><p>The tight lens syndrome may cause corneal epithelial staining, marked corneal stromal edema with small peripheral infiltrates, an anterior chamber inflammatory reaction, and severe conjunctival hyperemia. The signs and symptoms resolve within a few days of removal of the contact lens. A short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> and topical corticosteroids may hasten resolution of the clinical manifestations.</p><p>Contact lens removal may be facilitated by applying a topical anesthetic and contact lens saline solution before attempting to slide the lens off to the side or by using a suction-plunger lens remover designed for removal of rigid lenses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65740 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Dislocated contact lens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A contact lens may become dislodged from the cornea, migrate under the upper eyelid, and become embedded in the tissues of the superior cul-de-sac (fornix), causing pain, irritation, redness, and eyelid swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This condition occurs almost exclusively with rigid contact lenses.</p><p>Chronic dislocation (over weeks to months) occasionally produces sterile abscesses, cysts, eyelid retraction, orbital masses, foreign body granulomas, ptosis, and subconjunctival embedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Extreme (&quot;double&quot;) eversion of the upper eyelid may be necessary to locate and remove the problematic lens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant papillary conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant papillary conjunctivitis is a noninfectious inflammatory disorder that represents a reaction to lid movement over a foreign substance, such as contact lenses. It can occur in both soft and rigid gas permeable contact lens wearers and is characterized by foreign body sensation on the upper eyelid, associated with formation of &quot;giant&quot; (&gt;1 mm) papillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74752\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74752 \">picture 5</a>). Giant papillary conjunctivitis is discussed in detail separately.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage can be a complication of contact lens use, occurring in approximately 5 percent of contact lens wearers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hypoxia and acidosis in long-term contact lens wearers may cause permanent morphological changes, including reduced density of the endothelial cells that line the innermost surface of the cornea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. These cells pump excess fluid out of the stroma and are crucial in maintaining corneal clarity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2145382337\"><span class=\"h2\">Limbal stem cell deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awareness of contact lens-induced limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) has increased over the past decade. Limbal stem cells, which reside at the basal limbal region, function to maintain and regenerate the corneal epithelium and serve as a barrier to prevent conjunctival epithelium from invading the cornea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. LSCD can result from chronic trauma and hypoxic injury associated with contact lens wear. Significant ocular morbidity is possible since limbal stem cells do not regenerate. It is estimated that 2.4 to 5 percent of contact lens wearers develop signs of LSCD that correlate with the duration of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Most cases involve soft contact lenses, although it has been described with other lens types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p>Patients with LSCD report decreased vision, dryness, redness, irritation, photophobia, and pain, although they often remain asymptomatic in the early stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Clinical manifestations include focal or diffuse abnormal corneal epithelium in a whorl-like pattern with late <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> staining, recurrent or persistent epithelial defects, corneal conjunctivalization and neovascularization, subepithelial haze and scarring, ulceration, melting, and even perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Conservative treatment includes discontinuation of contact lenses and frequent use of preservative free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. Other topical treatment options include corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and autologous serum tears.

Bacterial keratitis is associated with yellow infiltrates while fungal keratitis tends to have white infiltrates, often with feathery borders, spreading branches, and multiple smaller satellite infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77231\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77231 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p>Stromal loss represents necrotic ulceration and focal thinning of the cornea.

Hypopyon, as well as fibrinous anterior chamber reactions, occur more frequently with fungal keratitis.</p><p>An endophytic fungal plaque on the endothelial surface may sometimes be diagnostic of fungal keratitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64228\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64228 \">picture 10</a>).

Many argue that obtaining corneal cultures may not be cost-effective for the initial treatment of infectious keratitis. However, if the infection is particularly severe at the time of initial presentation, or if the infection does not respond to the initial antibacterial therapy, cultures must be obtained.</p><p>Swab cultures obtained with cotton-tipped applicators are often inadequate and are not recommended unless there is no other recourse. Corneal scrapings for culture and Gram stain can be important in microbial identification of unusual bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (eg, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA]), or non-bacterial organisms such as fungi and <em>Acanthamoeba</em>. Chronic or atypical corneal infections may eventually require deeper lamellar excisional biopsies for identification.</p><p>Preferably, cultures should be performed by an ophthalmologist in a referral-based practice. Specimens from the infected cornea may be obtained by scraping with a Kimura spatula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71814\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71814 \">picture 12</a>) or a disposable sterile scalpel blade. The peripheral borders of the infiltrate, often the leading edge of infection, may contain the most active organisms and therefore yield the most productive cultures.</p><p>Specimens should be cultured for bacteria and fungus; special media are required when nontuberculous mycobacterial or amebic infections are suspected. Routine and immunofluorescent stains may be helpful, but cultures are the top priority when there is limited sample.</p><p>Contact lenses, cases, and lens care systems may provide an alternative source for culture, but they often harbor a wide spectrum of microorganisms, and culture results may be misleading or confusing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Impression cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to obtaining specimens by scraping is impression cytology, in which a cellulose acetate filter paper is placed on the ocular surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Even clean-appearing contact lens-related corneal abrasions, without infiltrates, should not be patched because such abrasions may occasionally be infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A full-blown corneal infiltrate may not be manifested in the first few hours of infection.</p><p>Antibiotic therapy should be empirically started at initial presentation of suspected abrasions and an examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy performed within 24 hours. If the cornea is deeply ulcerated or perforated, a protective metal or plastic eye shield should be applied before urgent referral to an ophthalmologist.</p><p>Concurrent cycloplegic eye drops may be used to reduce photophobia from ciliary spasm and to reduce the formation of pupillary adhesions to the lens (posterior synechia).</p><p>The use of concurrent glucocorticoid eye drops should be avoided in the acute phase of the keratitis. However, after the infection is under good control, select patients with visually significant central corneal inflammation or a severe anterior segment inflammatory response may benefit from topical corticosteroids used together with the antimicrobial drugs. The decision to start glucocorticoid therapy is best left to the ophthalmologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Corneal surgery may be indicated for extirpation of recalcitrant infectious foci, improvement of drug penetration, and corneal perforation. A conjunctival flap over the cornea may sometimes be required to arrest a persistent corneal ulcer but is not appropriate for fungal ulcers since organisms may survive under the flap.</p><p>Decisions about when and if contact lens wear may safely be resumed following resolution of infection are best left to the treating ophthalmologist and should take into account factors such as patient hygiene, compliance, coexisting ocular surface problems, and infection sequelae. For some patients, a type of lens other than the one worn prior to the infection may be indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected bacterial keratitis should be promptly and empirically treated with an antibiotic and referred to an ophthalmologist. For suspected bacterial keratitis, broad-spectrum topical antibiotic eye drops should be instilled as often as every hour around the clock. Ointments have poor corneal bioavailability and drops are preferred in the acute therapy of infectious keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Ointments may be used at bedtime to allow the patient to sleep through the night, but only after a positive response has been demonstrated to the initial intensive eyedrop treatment.</p><p>Options for treatment of bacterial keratitis are fluoroquinolone monotherapy or a combination of fortified topical antibiotics (eg, a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/54,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,60</a>]. Topical antibiotics are fortified by adding a highly concentrated saline solution of the intravenously formulated antibiotic powder to commercially available antibiotic eyedrops. Fortified antibiotics present problems in preparation and storage, while some fluoroquinolones may be associated with corneal precipitates and poor epithelial wound healing.</p><p>In one trial, the fourth-generation <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gatifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gatifloxacin</a> was more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> in the treatment of bacterial keratitis due to Gram-positive cocci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In vitro studies and in vivo animal studies suggest greater potency for the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Most bacterial infections respond to single-drug therapy with fourth-generation fluoroquinolone eye drops, such as gatifloxacin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>, or to alternating hourly doses of fortified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> and fortified <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> (14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> eye drops staggered 30 minutes apart from each other. We generally initiate treatment with gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin, although these agents are expensive. Severe infections may benefit from subconjunctival antibiotic injections in addition to the eyedrop therapy.</p><p>Second-generation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>) and third-generation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>) eye drops are also effective and are available in generic formulation. Some antibiotic resistance has emerged to these medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-contact-lenses/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], but they may be used as alternatives to the more expensive fourth-generation medications when cost concerns do not permit use of the newer drugs.</p><p>For bacterial keratitis, several weeks to months of treatment may be necessary. For most patients, intense hourly treatment is indicated for the first 24 to 48 hours, until some response is apparent, when applications can be tapered to every two and then every four hours and continued for a minimum of two weeks. Some patients with more severe infection will require ongoing antibiotic treatment for several months.</p><p>If the keratitis does not respond to initial treatment, cultures may be invaluable in the identification and antibiotic sensitivities of the resistant organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Fungal and protozoan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fungi and <em>Acanthamoeba</em> are less common than bacteria in contact lens infections, they can potentially lead to equally severe if not graver consequences. Diagnosis and treatment in these uncommon infections are often delayed, because of lower indices of suspicion, relative unfamiliarity, and clinical signs that masquerade as viral or bacterial infection. Response to antimicrobial treatment may also be slow, in part due to the presence of protective cell walls or cysts and in part due to difficult penetration of topical drug into deep cornea. Treatment may require prolonged use of medications for many months.</p><p>Amebic and fungal keratitis are discussed in detail separately.

Corneal abrasions should be treated with topical antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage and removal of the contact lens. We recommend <strong>not</strong> patching the eye for small (&lt;10 mm) corneal abrasions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
