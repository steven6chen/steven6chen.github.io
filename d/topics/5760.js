The majority of patients with chronic stable angina are still treated with medical therapy; however, revascularization with either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered in several subgroups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Indications for revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major complications associated with CABG are death, myocardial infarction, stroke, wound infection, prolonged requirement for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding requiring transfusion or reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The short-term, particularly perioperative, noncardiac complications that can occur following conventional CABG (using cardiopulmonary bypass) will be reviewed here. Cardiac complications and perioperative mortality after CABG are discussed separately.

An important factor is aortic instrumentation and manipulation, including cannulation, decannulation, and partial or complete clamping and unclamping, which can result in embolization of atherosclerotic debris. Technical errors in bypass graft construction that can lead to graft occlusion, primarily in saphenous vein grafts, also may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Data from randomized trials and observational studies are conflicting as to whether or not there is an improvement in clinical outcomes such as mortality and stroke with OP CABG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Off-pump and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Outcomes&quot;, section on 'Off-pump CABG'</a>.)</p><p>CPB systems designed to decrease the rates of the complications discussed above (particularly stroke) have also been evaluated. One such device, the mini-extracorporeal circulation (MECC), is a heparin bonded CPB circuit that requires a relatively small prime for the centrifugal pump, and does not include either an open venous reservoir (which minimizes blood-air contact) or direct reinfusion of cardiotomy suction from the pericardial space. This design has the potential to limit the systemic inflammatory response seen with traditional CPB.</p><p>In an initial prospective trial, 300 CABG patients were randomly assigned to MECC or OP CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There were no differences between the two groups in operative mortality and morbidity, transfusion rates, hospital stay, or serum levels of creatine kinase and inflammatory markers including interleukin-6. In a study of 40 consecutive patients undergoing CABG who were randomly assigned to either MECC or standard CPB, the former was shown to be a safe alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Improvements in surgical technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvements in surgical technique have led to a steady reduction in morbidity after CABG, despite the fact that patients currently undergoing CABG have higher-risk profiles. This was illustrated in a report that compared 5051 patients undergoing CABG from 1986 to 1988 with 2793 patients undergoing CABG from 1993 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the patients in the latter period were at higher cardiovascular risk, the risk-adjusted morbidity rate decreased from 14.5 to 8.8 percent with no change in risk-adjusted hospital mortality (2.8 versus 2.9 percent). A later report that evaluated over 37,000 patients undergoing CABG for multivessel disease in New York state between 1997 and 2000 found an in-hospital mortality of only 1.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The following are some of the improvements in technique that have reduced postoperative complications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications related to aortic manipulation can be limited by routine, careful evaluation of the ascending aorta using intraoperative transesophageal and epiaortic echocardiography to identify mobile and intramural atheromatous disease, and to help define safe areas for cannulation. Aortic manipulation also can be decreased using a &quot;single-clamp&quot; technique. By avoiding the application of an additional partial occlusion clamp to construct proximal anastomoses, neurologic complications can be reduced, although not eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advances have been made in the composition of cardioplegia fluid (eg, blood versus crystalloid) as well as substrate enhancement with aspartate and glutamate and superoxide radical scavengers. These advances, used in conjunction with integration of different routes of cardioplegia administration (antegrade, retrograde, and down the newly constructed grafts) to effect homogeneous delivery to all parts of the heart beyond coronary artery blockages, have resulted in more optimal myocardial protection. As a result, the heart can be safely arrested for as long as two hours with minimal cardiac dysfunction, allowing precise repair of complex problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normothermic or near normothermic systemic perfusion is now routinely used. Avoiding systemic hypothermia decreases coagulation abnormalities and organ dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the complications of CABG are related to the biologic response of the body to artificial perfusion and gas exchange through the nonendothelialized CPB circuit. Within seconds of CPB, formed and unformed blood elements come into contact with the large surface area of the CPB circuit. Despite anticoagulation with heparin, this interaction results in extensive activation of platelets, neutrophils, complement, cytokines, and the fibrinolytic system, producing a complex and intense &quot;inflammatory&quot; response. Although these responses are usually short-lived and leave no residual deficits, they can lead to long-lasting cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and neurologic dysfunction in a subset of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advances in perfusion technology and techniques and research in biomaterial sciences have resulted in the application of more biocompatible CPB circuits, such as heparin-bonded circuits. The use of these circuits has reduced the need for homologous transfusion and decreased neutrophil and complement activation, resulting in reductions in thromboembolic complications (including neurologic dysfunction), myocardial and pulmonary dysfunction, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Elimination of cardiotomy suction is an important adjunct by minimizing inflammation, thrombin and platelet activation, and the increase in markers of neuronal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active leukocyte depletion of transfused blood during CPB and of autologous saved blood prior to reinfusion can reduce perioperative morbidity, particularly when more than three blood transfusions are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, with increasing experience, some surgeons recommend continuation of aspirin throughout the preoperative period. The possible risk of aspirin therapy in patients undergoing CABG, including recommendations for the timing of aspirin therapy, is discussed separately.

Two reports comparing the bleeding risk with or without recent clopidogrel use in (mostly) stable patients undergoing CABG are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The larger of the two is a retrospective observational study of 1572 consecutive patients who underwent nonemergent off-pump CABG; 281 (18 percent) had either received a 300 mg loading dose before PCI or had been on oral clopidogrel within seven days of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients with, compared to those without, recent clopidogrel use had a significantly increased need for packed red blood transfusion and of reoperation for bleeding (6.4 versus 1.4 percent, odds ratio 5.1 on multivariable analysis). There was no difference in operative mortality between the two groups (1.4 percent).

In a prospective study of 100 patients who received clopidogrel within five days of off pump CABG, blood loss (and transfusion requirement) was significantly greater in patients in the third tertile of the percentage of platelet inhibitory response to clopidogrel (greatest residual clopidogrel effect), as assessed by thromboelastography, compared to those in the first and second tertiles (914 versus 623 and 683 mL, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In multivariate analysis, discontinuation date did not significantly predict either the degree of blood loss or transfusion requirement.

In these settings, discontinuation of clopidogrel prior to the recommended duration places the patient at increased risk. Thus, the timing of discontinuation of clopidogrel requires consideration of both the benefit (less bleeding) and risk (increased rate of ischemic events) of its discontinuation. The 2004 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guidelines on CABG and the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease recommend five (preferably seven) days off clopidogrel before CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

After enrollment of 2331 of 3000 patients scheduled to be randomly assigned to either aprotinin, aminocaproic acid, or tranexamic acid, the trial was terminated early because of a significantly higher death rate in patients receiving aprotinin. Similar findings were noted in a retrospective analysis of data from over 33,000 aprotinin recipients and over 44,000 aminocaproic acid recipients in which the unadjusted risk of death within the first seven days after CABG was 4.5 and 2.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The most common manifestations are usually minor and do not require surgical intervention. These include dermatitis, cellulitis, greater saphenous neuropathy, chronic nonhealing ulcers, and lymphocele.</p><p>Major complications are rare. In a retrospective review of 3525 CABG procedures, lower extremity wound complications occurred in 4 percent of patients; however, only 0.65 percent required additional surgical intervention, including wound debridement, skin grafting, vascular procedure, amputation, or fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Significant predictors of major wound complications were female gender, peripheral artery disease, and postoperative intraaortic balloon pump.</p><p>For patients in whom a conventional (open) harvesting has been used, the wound may be closed with either staples or sutures. A 2010 Cochrane systemic review (updated in 2012) of three trials including over 300 patients found no significant difference in the rates of leg wound infection (10.8 versus 8.0 percent, respectively) or dehiscence (9.3 versus 8.8 percent) between these two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, all included studies were felt to be of sub-optimal methodological quality and at risk of bias.</p><p>Endoscopic SVG harvesting was developed in the mid-1990s as a way to improve postoperative discomfort and to potentially reduce wound infection. It is estimated that nearly 70 percent of all procedures performed in 2008 in the United States used the endoscopic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Most studies have shown that the rate of leg wound complications is significantly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/74-76,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76,79</a>]. In a 2012 report of over 235,000 patients in the United States Society for Thoracic Surgery database (2003 to 2008), the use of endoscopic vein-graft harvesting was associated with a reduction in the rate of wound complications compared to open procedures (3.0 versus 3.6 percent; risk&ndash;adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

If it occurs, it tends to present months to years after saphenous venectomy and recurrent episodes occur in most patients. Classically, patients present with the acute onset of high fever, often greater than 40&ordm;C, systemic toxicity, and erythema and swelling of the lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Erythema of the lower extremity usually begins along the medial aspect of the mid-tibial region at the saphenous venectomy site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62183 \">picture 1</a>). It then spreads posteriorly and anteriorly and can involve the dorsal aspect of the ankle and foot, and can extend proximally to involve the medial thigh. Many patients have maceration and erythema of interdigital spaces indicative of tinea pedis infection (athlete's foot), which may represent the source of the infection. Deep vein thrombosis and infections of underlying medical devices (eg, a prosthetic vascular graft) are the two major differential diagnoses of post-venectomy cellulitis. </p><p>The diagnosis is made clinically, based on the presence of lower extremity erythema and fever. Cultures of blood, skin biopsies, and lesion aspirates usually do not identify a pathogen. Toe web cultures may be useful in establishing a probable pathogen in patients with active cellulitis and tinea pedis. When pathogens are recovered, non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci have been the most commonly isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Other beta-hemolytic streptococci and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>) are also possible pathogens. In the acute setting, antimicrobial therapy is directed against these organisms and usually results in the prompt resolution of systemic complaints and slower resolution of the lower extremity changes. Patients who are hospitalized for this syndrome should initially receive antibiotics intravenously. For patients with recurrent cellulitis, chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy and pre-emptive, patient-initiated therapy are options to prevent or manage additional episodes of cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Treatment of tinea pedis, if present, in an effort to decrease the risk of recurrent episodes, is also thought to be an important element in the prevention of recurrent lower extremity cellulitis. These treatment issues are the same as those for cellulitis in general and are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Preventative strategies are available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding, neurologic complications, infection, and acute kidney injury are four of the most important adverse outcomes after CABG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Approximately 30 percent of patients require a blood transfusion after CABG. Risk factors include lower preoperative hemoglobin, lower weight, older age, and female gender. Additional risk factors for perioperative transfusion include preoperative use of antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs, reoperation, acquired or congenital <span class=\"nowrap\">clotting/coagulation</span> abnormalities, complex procedures, and emergency operations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The major neurologic problems are stroke, neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as cognitive dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sternal wound infection and mediastinitis after CABG occur in approximately 1 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sternal wound infection and mediastinitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute kidney injury is a potential complication of CABG that can arise from a variety of causes, including intraoperative hypotension, postoperative cardiac complications that impair renal perfusion, hemolysis, atheroemboli, and exposure to contrast media. Approximately 1 to 2 percent of patients require dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Estafanous FG, Loop FD, Higgins TL, et al.
