As an example, in a systematic review that evaluated the seroprevalence of HBsAg in the general population over approximately 50 years, the estimated prevalence in China decreased from approximately 14 percent between 1957 and 1989 to 5.4 percent between 1990 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

As an example, a study from China showed that 1 (1.5 percent) of 65 anti-HBs-positive kidney transplant recipients who received kidneys from HBsAg-positive donors became HBsAg positive at three months after kidney transplantation, despite perioperative administration of 400 units of anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin.

However, these tests are better at detecting cirrhosis than differentiating different stages of hepatic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic and radiographic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although noninvasive measures are generally preferred over liver biopsy, there are potential limitations. As an example, scores for measuring liver stiffness may be increased by inflammation, congestion, and recent ingestion of food or alcohol. In addition, although high liver stiffness scores measured by transient elastography have been shown to predict worse clinical outcomes, including increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in nontransplant patients, data in patients with kidney failure or kidney transplantation are limited. There may also be limitations with serum marker panels since they include markers of inflammation (eg, aspartate aminotransferase levels), which may be lower in patients with renal failure, and markers of fibrosis, which are renally cleared and may be higher in patients with renal failure.

Antiviral therapy has been found to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy, with improvements in survival approaching that of HBsAg-negative kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy#H1731277821\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;, section on 'Preventing HBV reactivation'</a>). By contrast, those with decompensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension may be considered for combined liver and kidney transplantation.

Although HBV DNA is negative in most patients, if it is detected, antiviral therapy should be started. By contrast, for patients who are HBV DNA negative, it is reasonable to give a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine with follow-up anti-HBs titer measurement. If there is no response to the booster dose, the patient most likely has occult HBV or past chronic HBV with loss of HBsAg, and further doses of hepatitis B vaccine are unlikely to be effective.
