In this syndrome, tissues remote from the original insult display the cardinal signs of inflammation, including vasodilation, increased microvascular permeability, and leukocyte accumulation.</p><p>Although inflammation is an essential host response, the onset and progression of sepsis center upon a &quot;dysregulation&quot; of the normal response, usually with an increase in both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators, initiating a chain of events that leads to widespread tissue injury. Evidence supports a state of acquired immune suppression or immunoparalysis in some patients, which may occur simultaneously with or following the initial proinflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-inflammatory-response-syndrome-sirs-and-sepsis-in-children-definitions-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is this dysregulated host response rather than the primary infectious microorganism that is typically responsible for multiple organ failure and adverse outcomes in sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early recognition of sepsis is crucial to ensuring the best outcomes in children and is aided by a working knowledge of the children at particular risk, the common pathogens, and the clinical manifestations.

These definitions are important for the standardization of observational studies and in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in clinical trials. They may also be useful in helping clinicians determine the severity of a child's illness and in monitoring clinical progression and response to therapy. However, it should be noted that clinical concern for sepsis should not be limited to pre-defined cut-points for physiologic or laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-inflammatory-response-syndrome-sirs-and-sepsis-in-children-definitions-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Mental status changes can include anxiety, agitated delirium, restlessness, and disorientation. Patients may startle easily. Autonomic manifestations can include diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension, vomiting, and diarrhea.
