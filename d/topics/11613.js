Despite this seemingly low prevalence, neonatal HSV accounts for 0.2 percent of neonatal hospitalizations and 0.6 percent of in-hospital neonatal deaths in the United States, and is associated with substantial health care resource utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>Since the discovery of neonatal HSV disease in the 1930s, important breakthroughs in understanding how HSV is transmitted to the fetus and neonate, molecular methods to diagnose HSV, and antiviral treatment strategies have improved diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, despite these advances, neonatal HSV remains a clinical challenge.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of neonatal HSV infection will be reviewed below. The management, outcome, and prevention of neonatal HSV infection and non-neonatal HSV infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-management-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Management and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpetic-gingivostomatitis-in-young-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpetic gingivostomatitis in young children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSV is a member of the <em>Herpesviridae</em> family of viruses. It contains a double-stranded linear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) genome that consists of 150,000 base pairs that encode for more than 80 polypeptides, a capsid consisting of 162 capsomeres arranged in icosahedral symmetry that is covered by a tightly adherent membranous tegument, and an envelope consisting of 11 glycoproteins (gB, gC, gD, gE, gG, gH, gI, gJ, gK, gL, and gM), lipids, and polyamines that surrounds the viral nucleocapsid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81175\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81175 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Like all <em>Herpesviridae</em> viruses, HSV shares the biological properties of latency and reactivation, which causes recurrent infections in the host.</p><p>HSV enters the human host through inoculation of oral, genital, or conjunctival mucosa or breaks in skin, infects the sensory nerve endings, and then transports via retrograde axonal flow to the dorsal root ganglia, where it remains for the life of the host. The fetus may be infected transplacentally or through retrograde spread through ruptured or seemingly intact membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Latent virus is not susceptible to antiviral drugs, and infection (even after antiviral therapy) is lifelong. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-management-and-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Management and prevention&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p>HSV replicates efficiently in cell cultures, quickly producing lytic cytopathic effect in one to three days in most cell lines used in clinical virology laboratories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72209 \">picture 2</a>). The virus can be typed into HSV type 1 and HSV type 2 using serologic and molecular techniques. The DNA of HSV-1 and HSV-2 contain many homologous sequences distributed over the entire genome of both types, which produce both unique (gG) and antigenically similar polypeptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This cross-reactivity between HSV-1 and HSV-2 glycoproteins is the reason most commercially available serologic assays cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2638133238\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated incidence of neonatal HSV infection ranges from 3 to 30 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,9,10</a>]. The wide variation is likely due to differences in the prevalence of genital herpes in different areas around the world and differences in reporting practices. There are an estimated 1500 cases of neonatal HSV infection annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As the baseline prevalence of HSV-2 genital infection increases in the general population, the incidence of neonatal HSV disease is also likely to increase. Some data suggest that the incidence of severe neonatal HSV disease, including disseminated and central nervous system (CNS) disease, has increased since 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of HSV among young infants presenting to an emergency department setting with signs of CNS infection was investigated in a multicenter retrospective study of &gt;25,000 infants &lt;60 days old (median age 28 days) who underwent lumbar puncture for evaluation of fever or other clinical concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Testing for HSV was performed in 35 percent of patients. HSV infection was identified in 1.2 percent of infants tested (0.4 percent of the entire cohort), 39 percent of whom had skin, eye, mouth (SEM) disease, 32 percent of whom had CNS disease, and 29 percent of whom had disseminated disease. HSV prevalence peaked in the second week of life and declined substantially in the second month of life. Despite the low prevalence of HSV in this setting, testing and empiric treatment for HSV are often warranted in ill-appearing febrile neonates because early treatment has been shown to improve survival and reduce long-term sequelae. This issue is discussed briefly below and is reviewed in greater detail separately.

HSV is acquired perinatally when HSV infection, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, is present in the genital tract of the pregnant woman at the time of delivery. Factors that may influence perinatal transmission include the type of maternal HSV infection (primary versus recurrent), maternal HSV antibody status, duration of ruptured membranes, use of fetal scalp monitors, and mode of delivery (cesarean versus vaginal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

There is some overlap in these categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67814 \">figure 1</a>). For example, disseminated HSV disease may have SEM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CNS involvement in addition to other organs, and SEM disease may progress to CNS or disseminated disease if not treated early. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 may cause SEM, CNS, or disseminated disease; however, HSV-2 has been associated with a poorer outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,13,16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,16,29</a>].

Neonatal HSV SEM disease may appear benign at onset of illness but is associated with a high risk of progression to CNS or disseminated disease if not treated. SEM disease usually presents in the first two weeks of life but may occur at any time during the first six weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Localized skin disease is associated with coalescing or clustering vesicular lesions with an erythematous base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75059 \">picture 5C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Skin vesicles also may appear late in the course of disseminated disease.</p><p>HSV infection of the eye may initially appear asymptomatic.

All of the following virologic tests should be performed in neonates with suspected HSV infection (see <a href=\"#H67759361\" class=\"local\">'Detection of HSV'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surface cultures from the conjunctivae, mouth, nasopharynx, and rectum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Viral culture (with or without DFA) of <span class=\"nowrap\">swabs/scrapings</span> of skin and mucous membrane lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CSF HSV PCR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whole blood or plasma HSV PCR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpretation of diagnostic testing for HSV in neonates depends upon the clinical circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106132 \">table 1</a>). Most infected infants have positive viral culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PCR in one or more of the specimens listed above. Similarly, infants with negative viral <span class=\"nowrap\">culture/PCR</span> in <strong>all</strong> of the above listed specimens are unlikely to be infected with HSV. However, in the setting of highly suggestive clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings, negative results do not exclude HSV infection. (See <a href=\"#H67759832\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation/diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive evaluation should be performed in all neonates with suspected or proven HSV infection to determine the degree of organ involvement and exclude other diseases that may cause similar clinical symptoms. This evaluation is necessary, even in infants who appear to have isolated SEM disease because clinical findings may be absent early in the course of CNS and disseminated disease. In addition to routine laboratory tests, ophthalmologic examination and neuroimaging should be performed in all infants with virologically confirmed HSV infection, and electroencephalogram (EEG) should be performed in neonates with CNS involvement. (See <a href=\"#H67759355\" class=\"local\">'Additional studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of neonatal HSV is broad and includes infectious and noninfectious conditions that are associated with vesicular skin lesions, eye disease, CNS manifestations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic illness in neonates. Pending definitive diagnosis, empiric therapy for neonatal HSV may be warranted (after appropriate microbiologic specimens are obtained).
