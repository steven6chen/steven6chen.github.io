HDV is often referred to as hepatitis delta virus or delta agent. However, the term HDV is preferred.</p><p>HDV infection is closely associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although HDV can replicate autonomously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the simultaneous presence of HBV is required for complete virion assembly and secretion (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virion structure'</a> below). As a result, individuals with hepatitis D are <strong>always</strong> dually infected with HDV and HBV. Due to interference mechanisms that are not well understood, HBV replication is suppressed in most HDV-infected individuals.</p><p>This topic review will provide general information concerning the HDV structure and replication strategy, the nature of its strict association with HBV, and the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of HDV infection. Issues related to diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and liver transplantation are discussed separately.

HDV RNA is a single-stranded circle, with a high degree of self-complementarity and G+C content causing the circle to collapse as a rod-like structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Significant sequence heterogeneity (as high as 39 percent) exists among the different HDV isolates that have been sequenced, and a classification into eight HDV genotypes has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis D antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only antigen associated with HDV, the hepatitis D antigen (HDAg), is a structural component of the virion. It consists of a phosphoprotein encoded by an open reading frame present on the RNA strand complementary to the RNA genome (antigenomic strand) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 70 molecules of HDAg are complexed with each molecule of HDV RNA to form a ribonucleic core-like structure.</p><p>Two forms of HDAg (with different functions as described below) are coexpressed in infected individuals, differing by 19 amino acids at the C-terminus. The molecular weights of the two HDAg molecules are approximately 24 and 27 kilodaltons (kd). Their synthesis arises via an RNA editing process during HDV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stop codon UAG of the antigenomic HDV RNA causes the translation of HDAg to terminate, thereby giving rise to the small HDAg.

Two forms of antigenomic HDV RNA exist: a 0.8 kilobase (kb) RNA, which is the messenger RNA being translated into the HDAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the full-length 1.7 kb RNA, which is the template directing the transcription back into the HDV genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The host RNA polymerase II appears to be involved in the transcription of the 0.8 kb mRNA in a process that is regulated by direct binding with the HDAg itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

This entity is clinically indistinguishable from classical acute hepatitis B and is usually transient and self-limited. However, a high incidence of liver failure has been reported among injection drug users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The rate of progression to chronic infection is not different from that observed after classical acute hepatitis B, since persistence of HDV infection is dependent upon persistence of HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Superinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HDV superinfection of a chronic HBsAg carrier may present as a severe acute hepatitis in a previously unrecognized HBV carrier, or as an exacerbation of preexisting chronic hepatitis B.

The severity of the clinical course is influenced by several factors (see below). A study of 299 patients followed for up to 28 years found that persistent HDV replication was associated with annual rates of development of cirrhosis and HCC of 4 and 2.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The only predictor of liver-related mortality was persistent HDV replication.</p><p>Other studies have suggested that clinical outcomes may be related to the different HDV genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/15,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,20</a>]. HDV genotypes and, more interestingly, specific clinical features of hepatitis D, seem to cluster in distinct geographical areas. However, superinfection, or mixed infection with different genotypes can occur, particularly in patients who are at high risk for multiple exposures. In such patients, a single genotype usually predominates, with the minor genotype representing only approximately 10 percent of the total viral population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Western world, where the predominant genotype is genotype 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], acute hepatitis D has an increased risk of a fulminant course when compared to acute hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Once chronic HDV infection is established, it usually exacerbates the preexisting liver disease due to HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Progression towards cirrhosis may be rapid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. HDV-associated chronic liver disease may also run an indolent course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and asymptomatic HDV carriers have been found in some geographical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Patients who are currently referred for HDV infection appear to represent cohorts infected years ago in whom the HDV-related disease rapidly developed to cirrhosis, but whose subsequent disease progression has been slow. This was illustrated in a report from Italy in which the estimated 5- and 10-year probability of survival free of liver transplantation in patients who had already developed clinically overt cirrhosis was 49 and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

However, a retrospective study involving 200 patients with compensated HBV-related cirrhosis, of whom 20 percent were anti-HDV positive, found that HDV infection increased the risk of HCC threefold and mortality twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, these assays have limitations in the diagnosis of HDV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The assay most readily available for the diagnosis of HDV infection detects total anti-HDV. In acute hepatitis D, anti-HDV appears very late and may be missed if repeated testing is not performed. Thus, the true incidence of acute hepatitis D may be underestimated. This is especially true in immunodeficient individuals (eg, anti-HIV-positive) in whom a strong antibody response to HDV may be delayed or absent. Furthermore, after resolution of acute hepatitis D, anti-HDV may disappear with time. Thus, recognition of past HDV infection may be impossible.</p><p>Data on HDV epidemiology have mostly been gathered in chronic HBV carriers superinfected with HDV in whom HDV infection has progressed to chronicity. Anti-HDV is present in high titers in these patients, and the prevalence of chronic HDV infection can be reliably determined.</p><p>Available data suggest that approximately 5 percent of the HBV carriers worldwide may be infected with HDV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Since the number of HBV carriers has been estimated to be around 300 million, the number of individuals infected with HDV worldwide is estimated to be 15 million. The geographical distribution of HDV infection, however, does not parallel that of HBV, as areas endemic for HBV may be almost HDV-free. The level of HDV endemicity is partly related to the route of transmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">The Mediterranean basin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HDV infection is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. Infection tends to occur early, affecting mainly children and young adults. The main route of transmission is inapparent, permucosal, or percutaneous spread. Intrafamilial transmission is common and may be facilitated by poor hygiene. Thus, economically and socially disadvantaged populations are more affected.</p><p>A study from Italy suggested that the prevalence of HDV infection has declined in the past two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Anti-HDV antibodies were detected in only 69 of 834 HBsAg positive patients (8.3 percent) compared to 23 and 14 percent in studies from 1987 and 1992, respectively.

These changes are most noticeable in Italy, a country which was endemic for HDV infection and where HDV was initially described. Improvements in socioeconomic conditions, an increased awareness of the risk of transmitting infectious diseases fostered by AIDS prevention policy, and aggressive vaccination campaigns against HBV have all contributed to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of HBV infection and the spread of HDV infection among young Italian adults until 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>However, this decline appears to have stopped, and some recrudescence of HDV prevalence has been reported in both the Mediterranean area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and in Central Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Immigration from endemic countries has been suggested to be the cause for this trend, but is not the only reason: IVDU, sexual practices, and body modification procedures may also be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98309363\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDV infection is closely associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although HDV can replicate autonomously, the simultaneous presence of HBV is required for complete virion assembly and secretion. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to its dependence upon HBV, HDV infection always occurs in association with HBV infection. The clinical and laboratory findings vary with the type of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'HDV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical sequelae of HDV infection encompass a spectrum of manifestations from acute liver failure to the inactive carrier state. The severity of the clinical course is influenced by several factors. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of chronic hepatitis D'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDV infection is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. Infection tends to occur early, affecting mainly children and young adults. The main route of transmission is inapparent, permucosal, or percutaneous spread. Intrafamilial transmission is common and may be facilitated by poor hygiene. Thus, economically and socially disadvantaged populations are more affected. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of HDV infection'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bichko V, Netter HJ, Wu TT, Taylor J.
