In developed countries, the rate of seroprevalence among adults is &gt;70 percent. Transmission occurs mainly through saliva. The incubation period ranges from 5 to 15 days. (See <a href=\"#H1786231983\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentations of HHV-6 infection vary with the age and immune competence of the child. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic manifestations of primary HHV-6 infection in immunocompetent children are acute febrile illnesses with or without a rash and roseola infantum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81967 \">picture 1</a>) (also known as exanthem subitum and sixth disease). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute febrile illness'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=roseola-infantum-exanthem-subitum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Roseola infantum (exanthem subitum)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-6 has been reported in association with a variety of other clinical syndromes (eg, hepatitis, myocarditis). However, HHV-6 may be activated by a number of acute illnesses, and it is difficult to establish HHV-6 as the causative agent. (See <a href=\"#H3924896659\" class=\"local\">'Less common manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H694510971\" class=\"local\">'Unproven associations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactivation of HHV-6 may be associated with clinically relevant clinical syndromes (eg, encephalitis, pneumonitis) in immunocompromised children, including hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of primary HHV-6 infection in immunocompetent infants and children is usually based upon the clinical presentation (eg, acute illness with high fever, with or without rash, and nonspecific symptoms). Laboratory investigation is seldom necessary for immune competent children with classic roseola. (See <a href=\"#H3141829635\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory identification of HHV-6 may be necessary in immunocompromised children or immune competent children with atypical presentations or complications (eg, meningoencephalitis). (See <a href=\"#H2742591846\" class=\"local\">'Indications for laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation that an illness is caused by HHV-6 typically requires a compatible clinical syndrome, evidence of active HHV-6 infection (ie, with viral replication), and elimination of other conditions in the differential diagnosis. A combination of laboratory tests may be necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83219\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83219 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1445648141\" class=\"local\">'Approach to laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of HHV-6 infection includes other causes or mimics of acute febrile illness, fever and rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104587\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104587 \">figure 2</a>), febrile seizures, and meningoencephalitis.

Antiviral therapy may be warranted for HHV-6 infections associated with increased morbidity (eg, encephalitis, myocarditis) in both immune-competent and immune-compromised hosts; consultation with an expert in pediatric infectious diseases is suggested.
