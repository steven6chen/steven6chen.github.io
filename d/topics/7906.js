Abnormalities in growth during this time period may persist into adulthood, especially in patients who were preterm infants. This was illustrated in a report of very low birth weight (VLBW, &lt;1500 g) infants who were twice as likely to have a height less than the third percentile at 20 years of age than that of normal birth weight (BW) controls (10 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Preterm infants are at risk for poor growth while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and after discharge from the NICU. They must be closely monitored and may require interventions to promote better growth.</p><p>Growth in the preterm infant, including monitoring of growth and managing growth impairment while in the NICU and after discharge, will be discussed here. Enteral and parenteral nutrition for preterm infants are discussed separately.

Growth curves for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants that reflect neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practices common during the 1990s have been reported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these curves do not necessarily describe optimal growth.</p><p>Once they regain their birth weight (BW), the growth of preterm infants is targeted to the following goals based upon the estimated intrauterine growth from historical cohort studies of live births of infants of varying gestational age (GA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &ndash; 15 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length &ndash; 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/week</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head circumference &ndash; 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/week</span></p><p/><p>However, this practice has resulted in inadequate growth, as most low BW infants have weights that are below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile at the time of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. It also appears that the estimated &quot;normal&quot; in utero weight gain during the third trimester varies from 11.2 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, there are periods of slower growth that occur during episodes of infection or feeding intolerance that need to be compensated by accelerated growth during other time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although most centers, including our own, use a minimum growth target of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> it remains uncertain whether or not this is an appropriate target as growth often remains inadequate. </p><p>An alternative approach has been proposed that assessment of growth should be based on the growth of preterm infants with normal fetal development and little short-term morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, available data using this approach are very limited and do not reflect long-term outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish appropriate growth targets in preterm infants to determine the optimal approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth chart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the last decade, the number of high quality neonatal growth charts has increased greatly. These include the Olsen, Bertino, and Fenton growth charts, which use advanced mathematical modeling approaches such as the lambda-mu-sigma method (LMS) that allow the calculation of precise Z-scores and centiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As the number of charts has increased, so have questions about which ones should be used and when. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Z-scores'</a>.)</p><p>The selection of growth chart used depends on local practice and preference. Based on the available charts, we suggest the following based on the age of the preterm infant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 36 weeks gestation &ndash; The Olsen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90443 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90444 \">figure 2</a>) and Bertino charts are the best growth charts to assess appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA), or large for gestational age (LGA) status at all GAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. They perform relatively poorly for growth monitoring for preterm infants beyond 36 weeks of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 36 to 50 weeks corrected age (10 weeks post-term), the Fenton chart is the best growth chart to assess longitudinal growth in preterm infants over this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After four to eight weeks post-term, the World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for normal children can be used. As the Fenton charts are &quot;smoothed&quot; into the WHO dataset, there should be no change in centile when transitioning from one chart to another at this age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'WHO growth standards'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The Olsen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90443 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90444 \">figure 2</a>) and Bertino charts are based on large cohorts of newborn infants, and after excluding pregnancies with conditions likely to affect fetal growth, have constructed references for the BW of newborn infants across a wide GA range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As a result, they are optimally suited to determine whether babies are born LGA, SGA, or AGA. </p><p>Of note, the Olsen and Bertino charts are not representative of the growth of preterm infants. These charts based on the BW have a sigmoid shape, with the gain in weight with gestation flattening out at older GAs. This may be due in part to developing placental insufficiency at the end of gestation, but part is an artifact as GA becomes more upwardly censored at higher GA. So, for example, for infants presumed to be 34 weeks GA, a similar number are probably greater than 34 weeks and less than 34 weeks gestation. However, at a higher GA of 40 weeks, more infants are probably truly less than 40 weeks than truly greater than 40 weeks gestation (as fewer infants are born at &gt;40 weeks gestation than &lt;40 weeks gestation). This causes the curve of BW against GA to flatten at both the higher and lower extremes of gestation. This flattening near term is not reflected in the growth of preterm infants, because their growth does not slow at this time point. As a result, these curves are less well suited to the longitudinal growth monitoring of preterm infants as they approach their expected term date at 36 weeks gestation.</p><p>To overcome this limitation, in the Fenton charts the BW cohorts were &quot;smoothed&quot; into reference charts of term-born infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70389 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90267\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90267 \">figure 4</a>). Although this method has been criticized, the Fenton charts have been validated as a growth monitoring tool in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, this smoothing approach means that they perform poorly in classifying newborn near-term and term infants as being AGA, SGA, or LGA. As a result, after four to eight weeks post-term, the WHO growth charts should be used.</p><p>Two additional reference charts have been published. However, both are limited by the narrow range of GAs that are covered, which limits their usefulness in tracking growth. In our center, we continue to prefer the use of the Olsen and Bertino charts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Consortium published reference charts for preterm infants with GA between 24 and 33 weeks, based on data collected from centers from eight different global locations (Brazil, Italy, China, India, the United Kingdom, Kenya, Oman, and the United States) and with diverse ethnic backgrounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The number of infants was substantially fewer for this international reference than the other two that were based in the United States (Olsen) and Italy (Bertino). In addition, there remain concerns that fetal growth parameters may differ based on ethnicity and that population-based growth references for infants with the same genetic and environmental backgrounds should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight and head circumference charts for preterm infants with GA between 22 and 29 weeks were developed using data from the Vermont Oxford Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These charts are representative of a racially diverse dataset with similar measurements to the Olsen and Fenton charts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7279167\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH IN THE NICU</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4225848067\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postnatal growth for the preterm infant is primarily monitored as weight gain, because it is more reliable and reproducible than measurements of length and head circumferences. Changes in length and head circumference also are inadequate measures during short time frames, whereas weight gain can be accurately measured on a day-to-day basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85505150\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for adequate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both increased nutritional requirements due to stress (eg, episodes of sepsis) and inadequate nutritional intake contribute to the poor growth of hospitalized preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Inadequate intake can occur with either enteral or parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Immature gastrointestinal function limits the advancement of enteral feedings, while poor tolerance of intravenous lipids and glucose limits the use of parenteral nutrition. As a result, in preterm infants, nutrient intakes often fail to meet the recommended dietary intakes, resulting in rapid accruement of protein and energy deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk and extent of poor weight growth increase with decreasing gestational age (GA) and are most severe in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g).</p><p>Although there has been improvement of growth due to better general neonatal care and nutrition, preterm infants still have postnatal growth failure as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large multicenter study from the Vermont Oxford Network of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants (BW &le;1500 g), improved average growth velocity was observed during the 10-year study period between 2003 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, half of the infants still had postnatal growth failure (discharge weight less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for postmenstrual age [PMA]) in 2013, and approximately one-quarter had severe postnatal growth failure (discharge weight less than the third percentile for PMA). In this study, there was wide variation amongst the 648 North American hospitals with data from 2013, as the interquartile ranges for the lower and upper quarters for postnatal growth failure were 41.1 and 61.7 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of Californian VLBW infants born between 2005 and 2012, adjusted discharge weight Z-score increased over the study period but not birthweight Z-score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, approximately one-half of the infants born in 2012 were below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for weight at hospital discharge. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 23,005 extremely preterm infants (gestational age &le;28 weeks), the Z-scores improved from 1997 to 2012 for weight (-1.5 to -0.6), length (-1.68 to -1.16), and head circumference (-0.68 to -0.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p>Although these results show improvements in growth over the past decade, there remains a substantial proportionate of VLBW and ELBW infants with growth failure at hospital discharge. These results demonstrate the need for greater protein and energy intake on a body-weight basis in the preterm infant compared with term infants. Continued efforts to improve intake are required to ensure adequate growth for the preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A more detailed discussion on enteral nutrition and feeding for the preterm infant to maintain adequate growth is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-composition-of-human-milk-and-preterm-formula-for-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional composition of human milk and preterm formula for the premature infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-enteral-nutrition-in-the-premature-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to enteral nutrition in the premature infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3428522820\"><span class=\"h2\">Caloric goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nutritional goal for most preterm infants during hospitalization is for an energy intake of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59766 \">table 1</a>). This is equivalent to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day of preterm formula (24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz)</span> or fortified human milk. The target volume generally is one that supports a weight gain of more than 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day. </p><p>Ad libitum-fed preterm infants will often consume larger amounts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As donor human milk becomes more widely used in the NICU, estimation of caloric intakes is more difficult, and higher intakes or increased levels of fortification may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85505342\"><span class=\"h2\">Cue-based feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some NICUs, a cue-based approach to in-hospital feeding based on recognizing the satiety cues from the infant has been adopted for more preterm infants who can feed orally. Limited data suggest that this infant-driven feeding practice shortens the length of time for infants to attain full feedings and reduces length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Infants had similar weight gains. However, it is not clear whether this method of feeding will improve overall growth, or reduce the number of infants diagnosed with poor oral feeding or the need for orogastric or nasogastric feeds after discharge. Nevertheless, further investigation of this feeding method is warranted to see if there is any additional benefit of cue-based feeding over the traditional feeding based on a fixed time schedule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Feeding cues'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge, infants should have a nutritional evaluation, and a feeding plan should be developed. This should account for factors that may have interfered with growth in the NICU and provide a baseline for serial monitoring of weight, length, and head circumference after discharge. Additionally, an assessment should be made of the home environment, including eligibility for government nutrition or medical assistance programs, as lack of social support may be associated with growth failure (eg, poor weight gain).</p><p>Prior to discharge, the infant should usually be able to consume <em>ad libitum</em> quantities of human milk or formula. Less commonly, fluid intake may be limited at prescribed levels, or tube feeding (or other artificial means of feeding) used. Whatever the feeding plan is, appropriate growth should be demonstrated on the proposed discharge feeding regimen. The target volume generally is one that supports a weight gain of at least 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day or higher.

As a result, ongoing monitoring of growth is the essential first step in the management of growth in these infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring of growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth parameters include the infant's weight, length, and head circumference and should be monitored on a weekly to biweekly basis for the first four to six weeks after hospital discharge. After this initial period of close observation, infants who are growing normally can be monitored every month and then every two months.</p><p>Corrections for gestational age (GA) should be made for weight through 24 months of age, for stature through 40 months of age, and for head circumference through 18 months of age. We recommend using the Fenton preterm infant growth chart until the infant is 44 to 48 weeks PMA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70389 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90267\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90267 \">figure 4</a>), at which point the World Health Organization (WHO) growth curves for term infants can be utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There is a 10-week transition period when both charts can be used simultaneously and Z-score values can be compared. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Growth chart'</a> above.)</p><p>Biweekly or monthly follow-up visits should continue for infants with slow weight gain who remain below the third percentile on a standard growth curve when they have reached 40 postmenstrual weeks, or who have chronic health problems (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). Close monitoring should continue until a steady adequate growth pattern is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Infants who fall off their growth curve are growing suboptimally (ie, failing to thrive due to inadequate weight gain) and should be evaluated and treated as soon as the poor growth is identified. Delays in instituting treatment simply worsen the degree of growth failure and increase the amount of catch-up growth that will subsequently be required to achieve normal growth. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Interventions'</a> below.)</p><p>Infants who are extremely short may need further evaluation for growth retardation, including consultation by a pediatric endocrinologist. Referral is based on the extent of the shortness, parental concern, and whether catch-up growth has occurred.

An exception is an elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, which is associated with reduced stature later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It remains uncertain whether targeted interventions (phosphorus, calcium, or vitamin D supplementation) in preterm infants with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (&gt;600 international unit) result in improved height in childhood or adulthood.

Nevertheless, the decision whether or not to use a nutritional enriched formula should be made as part of the discharge planning process of formula-fed preterm infants. In our institution, we recommend enriched formula for infants with weights below the 10th percentile for age and who were born with BWs below 1500 g. We also recommend changing to enriched formula in those infants who initially received standard formula if they fail to maintain adequate growth or fail to &quot;catch up&quot; after hospital discharge. In our practice, we typically use enriched formula for preterm infants until they are six months of age post-term or until they have achieved adequate catch-up growth.</p><p>The commercially available enriched formulas compared with standard formulas are calorically denser (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/100</span> mL versus 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/100</span> mL) and have a higher content of protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and vitamins A, E, and D. In infants who receive standard formulas, additional vitamin supplementation and iron may be required to meet the needs of preterm neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) graduates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review of studies evaluated growth and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants who received nutrient-rich formula versus those who received standard full-term formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The quality of evidence was graded as moderate because of major potential bias due to the lack of allocation concealment and incomplete follow-up. The study found inconsistent results on the benefit of &quot;postdischarge&quot; formula (caloric density 74 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/100</span> mL) compared with standard formula on growth at 12 and 18 months of age postterm. However, there was evidence that the use of &quot;preterm&quot; formula (caloric density 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/100</span> mL), which is generally only available for in-hospital use, resulted in higher rates of weight gain at 12 to 18 months postterm.</p><p>It is the author's view that the balance of the evidence favors a small, but significant, growth advantage to enriched formulas after discharge. However, whether these benefits are sustained and whether they improve or worsen long-term health is unclear. An alternate approach is to provide enriched formulas to preterm infants who do not maintain adequate growth or fail to &quot;catch up&quot; after hospital discharge, although this approach has not been systematically studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Human milk-fed infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are clear that despite the many non-nutritional advantages of human milk feeding, growth of these patients is poorer than infants who received standard term formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, limited data in studies with small numbers of patients suggest that infants after discharge who received nonfortified human milk compared with those who received formula showed calcium and phosphorus deficiency and lower bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, this difference disappeared by two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>There also is no evidence demonstrating any additional benefits on growth from human milk fortification after hospital discharge in human milk-fed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/26,34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34,37</a>]. This was illustrated in a 2013 systematic review of the literature, which identified only two trials involving 246 preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Meta-analyses of limited data from both trials did not find any differences in growth outcomes during the first year of life in infants who received multinutrient fortified breast milk compared with controls who received unfortified breast milk. However, the analysis was limited as the intervention group in one of the trials only received half of their intake as fortified milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and in the other trial the cohort of infants spanned a wide range of birth weights (BW) from 535 to 2255 g, which included larger infants (ie, BW greater than 1500 g) in whom routine supplementation would not be administered in most centers in the United States.</p><p>Although it remains uncertain that fortification of human milk improves growth, maintaining human milk feeding of the preterm infant after hospital discharge should remain the goal. As an alternative to fortified human milk, which requires collection of pumped breast milk and addition of nutrients, human milk-fed infants with poor growth can be given two or three feeds daily of a postdischarge enriched formula. This has a surprisingly small effect on absolute nutrient intake, but does increase the intake of protein by 20 to 30 percent and calcium intake by approximately 50 percent compared with exclusive human milk feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These changes are similar to those reported with the use of fortifiers for human milk in the previously discussed study and to the relative increases in protein and mineral intake that result from changing from a term infant formula to an enriched one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There is no evidence to suggest how long such fortified feeds should be given, but the author's personal practice is to continue them until six months after the estimated date of term delivery or confinement (EDC). Also, if human milk supply becomes inadequate to meet the infant's needs, additional formula feeds should be composed of a post-discharge enriched formula.</p><p>In practice, the choice of whether, how, and how long to supplement human milk-fed infants needs to be individualized based on the infant's own risk factors, prior growth, and ability of the parents to carry out the suggested regimens. Some regimens (eg, fortification of expressed human milk) require significant effort and care and may be beyond some families to successfully implement. Use of unfortified human milk, with appropriate growth monitoring, remains a valid alternative for many preterm infants.</p><p>Human milk-fed preterm infants should also receive iron and vitamin D supplementation, as these two nutrients are inadequately supplied by human milk alone. Exclusively human milk-fed infants appear to be at risk for osteopenia of prematurity, and biochemical evaluation will often detect an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Data, however, are lacking on what interventions to use in human milk-fed infants with evidence of poor bone health as well as in those who exhibit poor growth. In these infants, we will use fortified human milk or enriched formula recognizing that these interventions have not been adequately studied. Management of vitamin D supplementation and iron are discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neonatal-bone-health#H89952855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neonatal bone health&quot;, section on 'Management of bone health in preterm infants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Prevention of iron deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor oral feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some preterm infants will struggle to maintain adequate enteral caloric intake due to poor oral feeding from developmental problems, oral aversion, or chronic medical problems. In particular, infants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated for a long time period may have difficulty with oral feeding, in part because of abnormal development of suck and swallow rhythms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Neurologic impairment may also interfere with oral feeding and growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These patients may benefit from occupational or speech therapy to improve oral motor function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In rare cases, infants with oral motor dysfunction may benefit from nasogastric or orogastric tube feeding while awaiting developmental improvement in the coordination required for oral feeding. All or a proportion of feedings may be provided by this route. In some cases, a gastrostomy may be preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This approach may also decrease caloric expenditure in chronically ill infants, such as those with congenital heart disease (CHD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).</p><p>In one report, fewer respiratory infections were seen in preterm infants discharged home with nursing care while they still required tube feedings compared with those who remained in the hospital until they could take full oral feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There were no differences between the groups in infant health, surgical procedures, or medications. Despite these findings, the safety, efficacy, or cost-benefit ratio of gavage feedings at home is not clear, and this technique must be used with caution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2936310875\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchopulmonary dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth failure is common in infants with BPD, with reported rates of 30 to 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-management-in-preterm-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In this study of 60 infants with BPD, patients were randomly assigned to one of two different 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span> formulas until three months corrected age.

At discharge, they remain at increased nutritional risk and merit close growth monitoring after hospital discharge. (See <a href=\"#H7279167\" class=\"local\">'Growth in the NICU'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preterm infants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enriched formula may improve the growth of preterm infants and is a reasonable option for formula-fed babies. We suggest using enriched formula for infants with weights below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for age at the time of hospital discharge or when full feeds are established, and who were born with birth weights (BW) below 1500 g (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

In our practice, if there is suboptimal growth, we suggest that infants receive two or three supplemental feedings of enriched formula daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
