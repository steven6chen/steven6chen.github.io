If untreated, the disease has been associated with a wide range of cardiovascular and cognitive morbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids is considered the first-line treatment for OSA in otherwise healthy children over two years of age with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, as recommended in guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Adenotonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on children in the United States, with over 500,000 procedures performed annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The procedure is performed with increasing frequency for the indication of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). In a survey of practice patterns by otolaryngologists in the United States, non-mutually exclusive indications for surgery included obstructed breathing of any type in 59 percent of cases, recurrent infections in 42 percent, and OSA in 39 percent of children; indicating that obstructed breathing now rivals recurrent infection as the most common surgical indication for adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although the majority of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for SDB benefit from the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the risk of complications or persistent disease after surgery mandates careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio of surgical intervention for each individual patient. Moreover, children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for SDB should be evaluated postoperatively for symptom resolution to determine the need for additional evaluation or treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702094\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING AND OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702102\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a range of nocturnal breathing abnormalities, ranging from habitual snoring to frank OSA.

A polysomnogram (PSG, also known as a sleep study) is required for a definitive diagnosis of OSA. </p><p/><p>The broad term &quot;SDB&quot; also encompasses non-obstructive causes of sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep-related hypoventilation disorders and central sleep apnea syndromes. In his topic review we will use the term &quot;obstructive SDB&quot; to describe signs and symptoms of nocturnal airway obstruction, with or without confirmation of OSA on PSG. For example, the term &quot;obstructive SDB&quot; as used here could include a child who snores and has hyperactive behavior during the day, but his or her PSG would not show, or does not show OSA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702108\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive SDB is exceedingly common in the pediatric population. Peak incidence is between two and eight years of age, likely due to the relative size of lymphoid tissue in comparison with airway diameter. Reports of the prevalence of primary snoring in children range from 4 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. A systematic review of epidemiologic studies found an overall prevalence of parent-reported snoring by any definition of 7.45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prevalence estimates for PSG-documented OSA in the general pediatric population have consistently ranged from 1 to 5 percent, based on cross-sectional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702114\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with obesity (especially if severe) are far more likely than lean children to have OSA, with reports of prevalence ranging from 13 to 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/11,13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,15,16</a>]. A variety of congenital syndromes, craniofacial abnormalities, or neuromuscular disorders are also associated with a significantly increased risk for OSA, with prevalence estimates of 30 to 100 percent in Down syndrome, 15 percent in cerebral palsy, 85 percent in Pierre-Robin sequence, and over 50 percent in children with achondroplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Micrognathia or midfacial hypoplasia are important predictors of OSA in infants, but isolated cleft palate probably is not. In a small prospective cohort study, infants with isolated cleft palate (confirmed by cephalometric findings) had similar polysomnographic findings compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease have reduced upper airway diameters and increased adenoid and tonsil size (known risk factors for OSA) compared with normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Somewhat increased prevalence of OSA also has been reported in African-American children and in children with a history of prematurity compared with the general population.

Less severe forms of obstructive SDB including primary snoring (snoring in the absence of OSA) have also been associated with decreased cognitive skills, diminished quality of life, and behavioral disturbances in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28-31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186372556\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because obstructive SDB is common and is an important cause of morbidity, all children should be screened for SDB as part of routine health care.

Existing literature does not indicate which referral serves best. If polysomnography is indicated (PSG), this can be arranged by the specialist. Alternatively, the referring provider may be able to arrange for a PSG if a facility with experience in pediatric PSG is available; children with abnormal results of PSG or other significant sleep problems can then be referred to the appropriate specialist.

Tonsillar size is most often described on a scale from 0 to 5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>0</strong> &ndash; Tonsils are entirely within the tonsillar pillar or previously removed by surgery. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>1+</strong> &ndash; Tonsils occupy 0 to 25 percent of the posterior pharynx.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>2+</strong> &ndash; Tonsils occupy 26 to 50 percent of the posterior pharynx. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>3+</strong> &ndash; Tonsils occupy 51 to 75 percent of the posterior pharynx.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>4+</strong> &ndash; Tonsils occupy 76 to 100 percent of the posterior pharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64546\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64546 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p>Indirect mirror examination of the nasopharynx and adenoid pad is often difficult in children. Direct fiber-optic transnasal laryngoscopy can be used as needed to assess adenoid size and the posterior or inferior extent of the pharyngeal tonsils, and can also identify other anatomical abnormalities such as lingual tonsillar hyperplasia or laryngomalacia. This procedure can generally be performed on awake children in the arms of their caregiver without sedation. </p><p>The child should be examined for a submucous cleft, which may be accompanied by a bifid uvula, midline deficiency or absence of muscular tissue, or a palpable notch in the hard palate. Children in whom submucous cleft of the palate is detected or those in whom velopharyngeal insufficiency is suspected (even if the examination is normal) should undergo additional evaluation by a specialist or a team skilled in cleft palate evaluation and management. In these children, standard adenoidectomy is often contraindicated due to an increased risk of developing velopharyngeal insufficiency. In these children, a limited or superior adenoidectomy is often performed. &#160;</p><p>Although the history and physical examination by the specialist are important components of surgical planning, they are not sufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of OSA in children with suggestive symptoms. As an example, parental reports of snoring and tonsillar size have high sensitivity but low specificity, whereas daytime somnolence or observed apneas had high specificity but low sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Furthermore, a systematic review concluded that there is only a weak association between tonsil size (as evaluated by the physical examination) and OSA severity (as measured by polysomnography [PSG]) in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Accordingly, in a systematic review, only 55 percent of children with suspected OSA on clinical evaluation subsequently had the disease confirmed when PSG was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Questionnaires designed to assess nocturnal and daytime symptoms in children with suspected sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are not sufficiently accurate to replace PSG in the clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. However, some questionnaires predict PSG results to an extent that is useful for clinical research, and other questionnaires may be useful to assess OSA-related behavioral issues and quality of life, and thereby help to determine the need for additional evaluation and support. At least two studies suggest that a pediatric OSA symptom inventory may predict some key outcomes of adenotonsillectomy more effectively than PSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Questionnaires'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702180\"><span class=\"h3\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attended in-laboratory nocturnal PSG (overnight PSG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of OSA, as it is the only method able to definitively identify the presence of obstructive events and quantify the severity of OSA, including gas-exchange abnormalities and sleep disruption. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher-risk children &ndash; We suggest PSG prior to adenotonsillectomy for children with conditions that increase the risk of perioperative respiratory complications. These conditions include obesity (especially if severe), Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103835 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,41</a>]. The purpose of the PSG in these children is to improve diagnostic accuracy in high-risk populations and define the severity of OSA to optimize perioperative planning. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard-risk children &ndash; For all other children, the necessity of preoperative PSG is controversial. Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all children undergo PSG if this service is readily available, but acknowledge that alternative testing or referral to a specialist can be substituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By contrast, guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) recommend PSG only if there is discordance between tonsil size and the reported severity of SDB symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p>The controversy arises from several recognized limitations of PSG: PSG has never been validated as a reliable tool to predict the risk of adverse outcomes of SDB or response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There is also often a disparity between PSG measures and the severity of clinical symptoms. Children with severe daytime and nighttime symptoms may have a normal PSG, and snoring and symptoms of SDB have been associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities even in the absence of documented OSA on PSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Conversely, snoring children who are otherwise asymptomatic occasionally have severe respiratory disturbances on PSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Children with symptoms and signs of OSA, but negative PSGs, may still benefit from adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Finally, pediatric PSG is expensive, labor-intensive, requires specially trained personnel, and may not be readily available in all areas. </p><p>In view of these limitations, it is not surprising that the use of PSG to confirm OSA prior to surgical intervention in clinical practice is somewhat selective, especially by otolaryngologists. In a 2004 practice pattern survey of pediatric otolaryngologists, 75 percent of respondents reported that they requested PSG in less than 10 percent of otherwise healthy children presenting with symptoms of SDB prior to performing adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. An updated internet practice survey conducted in 2013 showed that only 4 percent of pediatric otolaryngologists always referred children with SDB for PSG before performing adenotonsillectomy, 65 percent sometimes referred them, and 31 percent rarely or never referred them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702186\"><span class=\"h3\">Other diagnostic testing for OSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If attended in-laboratory nocturnal PSG is not available, clinicians may consider alternate diagnostic tests including home sleep apnea tests, which are increasingly used in adults but are not adequately validated in children. Other alternatives to in-laboratory PSG include &quot;nap&quot; PSG, overnight continuous pulse oximetry, or audio- and video monitoring. All of these tests have a low negative predictive value, indicating that a negative result is insufficient to exclude OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Important considerations include the child's age, polysomnographic (PSG) abnormalities, and any underlying medical issues or complications related to OSA. Treatment decisions for children with OSA are discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Adenotonsillectomy is generally considered first-line therapy for otherwise healthy children who have moderate or severe OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Adenotonsillectomy may also be initial therapy for children with multifactorial OSA, including contributions from obesity, if appreciable adenotonsillar tissue is present. OSA in obese children usually improves following adenotonsillectomy, although the outcome may be less satisfactory than in lean children. Finally, adenotonsillectomy should be considered in a child with OSA who does not have clear adenotonsillar hypertrophy. This is because in these circumstances the lymphoid tissue can still occupy a significant proportion of the potential upper airway. </p><p>Children with Down syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disorders, or mucopolysaccharidoses typically have multifactorial OSA, with airway obstruction at multiple sites. They are therefore more likely to have respiratory complications in the perioperative period, and to have persistent OSA after adenotonsillectomy, as discussed below. Nonetheless, adenotonsillectomy is often the most appropriate initial therapy for these children if appreciable adenotonsillar tissue is present, and usually leads to improvement in OSA, even if the OSA does not fully resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Medical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjuvant surgical procedures are used as alternatives or supplements to adenotonsillectomy, depending on the severity and specific locations of airway obstruction in the individual patient, and on associated comorbidities.

A variety of instruments and technologies have been developed for this purpose including monopolar electrocautery (Bovie), lasers, diathermy, bipolar electrosurgical scissors or forceps, and bipolar radiofrequency ionic dissociation. Hot techniques allow for simultaneous cauterization of blood vessels and enable surgeons to perform the procedure quickly and with minimal blood loss in most cases. </p><p/><p>Each of these approaches has advantages. Hot techniques allow for simultaneous cauterization of blood vessels and enable surgeons to perform the procedure quickly and with minimal blood loss in most cases. On the other hand, some studies have shown that use of cold dissection and radiofrequency techniques are associated with less pain and more rapid return to normal function. As an example, a systematic review comparing cold dissection with diathermy tonsillectomy in 254 patients found that the diathermy group had reduced intraoperative bleeding, but increased pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Therefore, none of the more current clinical guidelines advocate for use of any one specific surgical technique for extracapsular tonsillectomy over others, and the decision of which technique to use is generally based on surgeon preference and training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702283\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracapsular tonsillectomy (tonsillotomy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracapsular tonsillectomy (also known as subtotal or partial tonsillectomy, or &quot;tonsillotomy&quot;) is increasingly used for the treatment of obstructive SDB. In this technique, microdebriders, bipolar electrosurgical scissors, or radiofrequency ablation (including &quot;coblation&quot;) devices are used to debulk the obstructing portions of the tonsil parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Some evidence suggests that the technique permits more rapid recovery compared with traditional tonsillectomy, and possibly reduces the risk of postoperative hemorrhage. However, there is a risk of tonsillar regrowth, which usually is clinically insignificant but occasionally requires revisional surgery. </p><p>The evidence that this technique permits more rapid recovery comes from multiple randomized trials comparing adenotonsillectomy techniques for children with SDB. As an example, a randomized study with 156 patients compared treatment with intracapsular tonsillectomy with microdebrider, intracapsular tonsillectomy with coblation, and traditional extracapsular tonsillectomy with electrocautery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Patients undergoing intracapsular tonsillotomy with either coblation or microdebrider returned to a normal diet and activity between one and two days earlier than those undergoing extracapsular tonsillectomy, and the subgroup using coblation required pain medication for two days fewer than patients in the other groups. There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative complications between the three techniques. Similarly, in a systematic review that included 16 randomized studies, pooled data analysis demonstrated that length of time until pain was absent was superior with intracapsular tonsillectomy, compared with traditional extracapsular tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>The evidence regarding postoperative hemorrhage is somewhat weaker. The above systematic review concluded that intracapsular tonsillectomy was associated with marginally decreased rates of postoperative hemorrhage compared with extracapsular tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], while a separate review found no difference in postoperative hemorrhage or dehydration among high-quality studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Reported rates of tonsillar regrowth after intracapsular tonsillectomy range from 0.5 to 16.6 percent, which is of particular concern when the technique is used for treatment of SDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. The regrowth occasionally is clinically significant. As an example, one study reported regrowth in 7 of 42 children after intracapsular tonsillectomy (16.6 percent), and 5 of these children required revision tonsillectomy (12 percent overall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In a randomized trial of intracapsular tonsillectomy versus extracapsular tonsillectomy for OSA, initial outcomes were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, 5 of 39 (13 percent) children who underwent intracapsular tonsillectomy for OSA needed repeat surgery for regrowth and recurrence of OSA, compared with 0 of 40 children who underwent extracapsular tonsillectomy. </p><p>In view of these potential benefits and uncertainties, intracapsular tonsillectomy is often but by no means universally used for surgical treatment of obstructive SDB in children. In a practice pattern survey of pediatric otolaryngologists in the United States, 73 percent of surgeons reported always performing complete extracapsular tonsillectomy for a surgical indication of SDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40090386\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenoidectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During adenoidectomy, the obstructing portions of adenoid tissue are removed from the nasopharynx with the use of ether sharp curettes (sharp or cold dissection), electrocautery, coblation, or microdebrider (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103326 \">picture 4</a>).

In some cases, OSA appears to restrict weight gain in some children, and adenotonsillectomy can reverse the restriction or promote weight gain, at least in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In a retrospective case-control series of 154 children undergoing adenotonsillectomy and 182 controls, those children undergoing surgery gained more weight over the subsequent two years. A statistically significant increase in weight was seen the obese children after surgery, but not in those who were overweight or of normal weight at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In the CHAT trial, weight gain was also greater in children who had early adenotonsillectomy compared with the observation-only controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Furthermore, children who were overweight (but not those who were normal weight or underweight) prior to surgery were more likely to become obese by the seven-month follow-up, compared with children who did not undergo surgery. Among children who were overweight at baseline who underwent adenotonsillectomy, 52 percent became obese at follow-up, compared with 21 percent in the watchful waiting group. Thus, when children at risk for overweight or obesity require treatment for OSA by adenotonsillectomy, care should be taken to minimize or reverse anticipated weight gain.

In this study, 15 children with neurologic impairments and OSA were treated with UPPP in conjunction with adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. There was a statistically significant improvement in mean oxygen saturation nadir from 65 to 85 percent (p = 0.005). In long-term follow-up, 77 percent (10 of 13) of the patients did not require additional airway intervention. Small sample size, absence of control groups, and paucity of validated outcome measures preclude analysis of the utility of this procedure in the broader pediatric population. Potential complications include nasopharyngeal stenosis, palatal incompetence, and speech difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/125,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,126</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2865702542\"><span class=\"h3\">Tracheotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tracheotomy can be considered in children with persistent severe OSA despite surgical intervention, especially if they are intolerant of CPAP therapy. It can also be considered as a first-line treatment in children with severe OSA and airway obstruction who are not considered appropriate candidates for other surgical procedures. Although tracheotomy is an effective treatment for OSA and airway obstruction, it is associated with complications in as many as 43 to 77 percent of children, including bleeding, tracheoesophageal fistula, accidental decannulation, or tube occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2021115531\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Complication rates are low and most studies indicate significant benefit, as measured by resolution or improvement in breathing during sleep (as measured by polysomnography), as well as in nighttime symptoms, daytime symptoms, and quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H186373135\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2865702351\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Higher risk</strong> &ndash; Risk factors for respiratory and other complications after adenotonsillectomy and for persistent disease after recovery include obesity (especially if severe), severe OSA at baseline, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, or mucopolysaccharidosis. Patients with sickle cell disease also are at risk for perioperative respiratory complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103835 \">table 1</a>). For these patients, we recommend the following precautions: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preoperative polysomnography (PSG) to assist in surgical decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H2865702180\" class=\"local\">'Polysomnography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Operative setting that permits tertiary care if needed, including observation in hospital or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after adenotonsillectomy. (See <a href=\"#H2865702134\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a tertiary care facility'</a> above and <a href=\"#H281484012\" class=\"local\">'Operative setting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Close clinical follow-up after adenotonsillectomy, with low threshold for performing postoperative PSG for many or all of these high-risk patients, especially if persistent symptoms are present. (See <a href=\"#H451438665\" class=\"local\">'Indications for postoperative polysomnography'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standard risk</strong> &ndash; For patients without the above risk factors and who are otherwise healthy, adenotonsillectomy usually can be safely performed as an outpatient procedure. Expert opinion varies as to whether PSG should be routinely performed preoperatively for children with obstructive SDB, and whether young children (&lt;3 years) should be routinely observed in-hospital overnight after the surgery. All patients should have a clinical reevaluation to determine whether snoring and other symptoms of SDB have resolved, and those with ongoing symptoms should have a postoperative PSG. (See <a href=\"#H281484012\" class=\"local\">'Operative setting'</a> above and <a href=\"#H451438665\" class=\"local\">'Indications for postoperative polysomnography'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of surgical techniques have been developed for adenotonsillectomy. Traditionally, extracapsular (complete) tonsillectomy has been used, with either &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; dissection techniques. Intracapsular tonsillectomy (also known as partial tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy) is increasingly used. This technique in comparison to extracapsular tonsillectomy may permit more rapid recovery, but also may increase risk of tonsillar regrowth in some patients. The optimal surgical technique has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H2865702269\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have minimal adenotonsillar tissue, are poor candidates for adenotonsillectomy for any other reason, or who have persistent clinically significant OSA after adenotonsillectomy, treatment options may include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or adjuvant surgical procedures, including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tongue base procedures, lateral and expansion pharyngoplasty, and mandibular distraction osteogenesis. These adjuvant surgical procedures are most commonly needed for patients with OSA risk factors other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy alone, such as in children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial syndromes, or neuromuscular disease. Additional preoperative evaluation with techniques including drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) or cine-magnetic resonance imaging can help to determine the site(s) of residual obstruction to assist operative planning. (See <a href=\"#H2865702493\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant surgical procedures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2865702403\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic procedures'</a> above.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ross RD, Daniels SR, Loggie JM, et al.
