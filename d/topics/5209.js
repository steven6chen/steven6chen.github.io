The disorder can affect women and men but is more common in women. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat because the underlying cause is not well understood.</p><p>The symptoms and diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> will be discussed here. Treatment of this disorder is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> has evolved over the years and will probably continue to change as the cause is better understood. The American Urological Association (AUA) defines <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks&rsquo; duration, in the absence of infection of other identifiable causes.</p><p>It is difficult to know for sure how many people are affected by <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> but research indicates that <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms occur in about 2 percent of women. However, many fewer than that are diagnosed with the disorder, perhaps because it is unrecognized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PAINFUL BLADDER CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is known about the cause of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span>. Many studies have shown that patients with this disorder have abnormalities in the lining of the bladder. However, it is not known if these bladder abnormalities are the cause of symptoms or if the abnormalities develop as a result of some unknown underlying disorder that also causes painful bladder symptoms.</p><p>It is likely that the nerves in the bladder become highly sensitive to pain and pressure as <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> develops. Nerves outside the bladder, including nerves of the abdomen, pelvis, and hips, and legs, may also become more sensitive.</p><p>One or more events may lead to the symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS,</span> including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An episode of vaginitis or prostatitis (eg, an infection of the vagina or a bacterial infection of the prostate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder, pelvic, back, or other type of surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma (eg, fall onto the tailbone [coccyx] or car accident)</p><p/><p>However, in many people, there is no clear explanation for why or how the symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> first began.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PAINFUL BLADDER SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> can vary from one person to another and from one episode to another. All patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> have bladder pain that is relieved at least partially by urinating. Symptoms usually include a frequent and urgent need to urinate during the day <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> night. Most, although not all, people with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> do not have urinary leakage (incontinence). Most people describe pain in the suprapubic area (in the lower abdomen, above the pubic bone) or urethral area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). The severity of pain ranges from mild burning to severe and debilitating pelvic pain.</p><p>Most people describe symptoms that begin gradually, with worsening discomfort, urgency, and frequency over a period of months. A smaller subset of patients describes symptoms that are severe from the beginning. When symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> begin suddenly, some patients are able to name the exact date on which symptoms began. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Painful bladder causes'</a> above.)</p><p>Some people with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> also have other types of chronic pain, such as irritable bowel syndrome, painful menstrual periods, endometriosis, vulvar pain (vulvodynia), fibromyalgia, or prostatitis. <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms are sometimes at their worst during times when other pain symptoms are also at their worst. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irritable-bowel-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Irritable bowel syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms may vary from one day to the next. Worsening of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> symptoms may occur after consuming certain foods or drinks (eg, coffee, alcoholic drinks, spicy foods), during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (14 to 28 days after the first day of the last period), during stressful times, or after activities such as exercise, sexual intercourse, or being seated for long periods of time (eg, during a plane trip).</p><p>A person with severe disease may have to urinate several times per hour, which can seriously disrupt daily activities and sleep. As a result of these symptoms, home and work life are often disrupted, interest in sex may be minimal, and the person may have difficulty coping with chronic pain and fatigue. In surveys, 50 percent of patients reported being unable to work full time, 75 percent described pain with intercourse, 70 percent reported sleep disturbance, and 90 percent reported that <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> affected their daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-interstitial-cystitis-bladder-pain-syndrome-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PAINFUL BLADDER EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is based upon a person's symptoms and examination. A careful medical history, physical examination, and sometimes laboratory testing are needed to confirm the diagnosis and also to be sure that another condition (eg, bladder infection or kidney stone) is not the cause of symptoms. There is no single test that can definitively diagnose <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination usually includes a complete pelvic examination with a brief rectal exam. Often, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> have tenderness in the lower abdomen, hips, and buttocks. Women often have tenderness in the vagina and around the bladder, and men may have tenderness in the scrotum and penis. For this reason, being examined can be uncomfortable.</p><p>If an examination is too uncomfortable, some health care providers will recommend that the patient begin a course of treatment for <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> without further testing. If improvement is not seen, it may be necessary to perform more testing to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Some providers will measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after the patient urinates; this is called a post-void residual. This measurement can be done by inserting a small catheter into the bladder or by using ultrasound. While it is normal to have some urine in the bladder after voiding, having a large amount of urine is not normal. Urinary retention is the medical term for retaining urine in the bladder and is not typical of <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians will perform a urine test to ensure that a person's symptoms are not related to another condition, such as a kidney stone or bladder infection. If a urinary tract infection is discovered, the person will be treated with antibiotics. If blood is detected in the urine, further urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnostic testing (eg, cystoscopy) may be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy is a test that allows a doctor to examine the inside of the bladder. Cystoscopy is not required to diagnose <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> but may be recommended in certain situations. Cystoscopy can be done in the office after a numbing gel is applied inside the urethra. It can also be done in an operating room while a patient is under anesthesia, sometimes in combination with other procedures.</p><p>To perform cystoscopy, a clinician inserts a thin telescope with a camera through the urethra and into the bladder. The clinician examines the inside (lining) of the bladder to determine if there are any abnormalities. A person with <span class=\"nowrap\">IC/BPS</span> may have either a normal or abnormal-appearing bladder. If an abnormality is seen, further testing may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PAINFUL BLADDER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A topic review that discusses the treatment of interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/bladder</span> pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(IC/BPS)</span> is available separately.
