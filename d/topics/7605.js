Nevertheless, the diagnosis and appropriate management of gastric polyps are important, as some polyps have malignant potential.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, and management of gastric polyps. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-polyps/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyomas, lipomas, and other subepithelial lesions that may have a polypoid appearance on upper endoscopy are discussed in detail, separately.

On narrow band imaging, fundic gland polyps have a honeycomb appearance with dense vasculature, a nonspecific pattern that also can be seen in hyperplastic polyps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On pathology, fundic gland polyps are composed of normal gastric corpus-type epithelium, arranged in a disorderly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microcystic configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66607\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66607 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77794 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-polyps/abstract/5,9,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,34</a>]. Microcysts are characteristic, and may be lined by any of the normal cell types found in the gastric corpus. The glandular compartment typically reveals distorted architecture with irregular gland buds, tortuous glands, or irregular stellate glandular configurations. Inflammation is usually minimal. Mild hyperplasia of the muscularis mucosa may occur in a pericystic configuration. These lesions probably arise from proliferation and differentiation of aberrantly located proliferative cells in the stem cell compartment of the corpus epithelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignant potential</strong> &ndash; Somatic <em>APC</em> gene mutations have been detected in over 70 percent of syndromic fundic gland polyps without dysplasia, but in less than 10 percent of sporadic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastric-polyps/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The remaining polyps should be carefully inspected on endoscopy and any lesion that appears significantly different should be biopsied and, if possible, resected. Fundic gland polyps &ge;1 cm in diameter, polyps that are ulcerated or located in the antrum should be resected to confirm the diagnosis and rule out dysplasia or neoplasia.</p><p>The possibility of a familial polyposis syndrome should be considered in patients with &ge;20 polyps, fundic gland polyps in the antrum, young onset fundic polyps (prior to age 40 years), or concurrent duodenal adenomas, and a colonoscopy should be performed. </p><p>In patients with sporadic fundic gland polyps attributed to PPI use, we discontinue PPIs in patients with &ge;20 polyps or polyps &gt;1 cm. Hypergastrinemia in these patients suggests either the presence of a gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) or more commonly PPI-induced hypochlorhydria, which if present is further reason to stop or reduce the PPI dose.

Hyperplastic polyps are the most prevalent polyps in regions where <em>H. pylori</em> infection is common. In contrast, in Western countries, where <em>H. pylori</em> infection has a lower prevalence and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is common, fundic gland polyps are more prevalent. (See <a href=\"#H176064200\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with small solitary polyps, we recommend that polyps be biopsied and resected, if possible, for histologic characterization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Polypectomy should be performed for all known neoplastic polyps and for all polyps &ge;1 cm in diameter, as biopsies alone cannot exclude foci of high-grade dysplasia or early gastric cancer. In patients with multiple polyps, the largest polyp should be excised and representative biopsies obtained from the remaining polyps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The normal-appearing antral and corpus mucosa should be sampled to rule out dysplasia occurring in the background of metaplastic atrophic gastritis and infection with <em>H. pylori. </em>We suggest <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy in those who test positive. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fundic gland polyps may occur sporadically, in association with polyposis syndromes, or in response to chronic PPI therapy. They have very low to no malignant potential when associated with PPI use or occurring sporadically. Fundic gland polyps associated with polyposis syndromes have been associated with dysplasia but progression to malignancy is rare. Fundic gland polyps &ge;1 cm in diameter, polyps with ulceration, or located in the antrum should be resected. In patients with multiple (&ge;20) or large (&ge;1 cm) sporadic fundic gland polyps, withdrawal of the PPI should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Fundic gland polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperplastic polyps occur in association with <em>H. pylori-</em>related atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia, and adjacent to ulcers and erosions. They are generally benign, but have some malignant potential. Hyperplastic polyps &gt;0.5 cm should be resected completely. Surveillance with upper endoscopy should be performed based on the cancer risk due to concurrent chronic atrophic gastritis and other risk factors for gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hyperplastic polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric adenomas typically form in atrophic gastric mucosa and may also be seen in association with familial polyposis syndromes. Most gastric adenomas are asymptomatic. Polyps that cause symptoms are most likely to present with gastrointestinal bleeding or rarely obstruction. As gastric adenomas are a precursor lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma, we recommend resection of all gastric adenomas endoscopically or surgically if necessary (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We perform an upper endoscopy for surveillance one year after initial resection of adenomatous gastric polyps. In individuals at high risk for gastric cancer, surveillance is continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gastric adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric neuroendocrine tumors may be associated with hypergastrinemia (type 1 and 2) or may occur sporadically (type 3). In contrast with patients with type 3 gastric neuroendocrine tumors who may have metastases at the time of resection, patients with type 1 and 2 gastric neuroendocrine tumors usually have an indolent course. For type 1 and 2 gastric neuroendocrine tumors smaller than 1 to 2 cm, endoscopic resection is the treatment of choice. Type 3 tumors are treated by partial or total gastrectomy with local lymph node resection.
