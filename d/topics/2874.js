The relationship of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to time is graphically represented by the CO<sub>2</sub> waveform, or capnogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67700 \">figure 1</a>). Changes in the shape of the capnogram are diagnostic of disease conditions, while changes in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the end of each tidal breath, can be used to assess disease severity and response to treatment. Capnography is also the most reliable indicator that an endotracheal tube is placed in the trachea after intubation.</p><p>Oxygenation and ventilation are distinct physiologic functions that must be assessed in both intubated and spontaneously breathing patients. Pulse oximetry provides instantaneous feedback about oxygenation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>). Capnography provides instantaneous information about ventilation (how effectively CO<sub>2</sub> is being eliminated by the pulmonary system), perfusion (how effectively CO<sub>2</sub> is being transported through the vascular system), and metabolism (how effectively CO<sub>2</sub> is being produced by cellular metabolism).</p><p>Capnography became a routine part of anesthesia practice in Europe in the 1970s and in the United States in the 1980s. It is now part of the standard of care for all patients receiving general anesthesia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-during-anesthesia#H875814525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring during anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Capnography'</a>) and is an emerging standard of care in emergency medical services, emergency medicine, and intensive care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors measure gas concentration, or partial pressure, using one of two configurations: mainstream or sidestream. Mainstream devices measure respiratory gas (in this case CO<sub>2</sub>) directly from the airway, with the sensor located on the airway adapter at the hub of the endotracheal tube (ETT). Sidestream devices measure respiratory gas via nasal or nasal-oral cannula by aspirating a small sample from the exhaled breath through the cannula tubing to a sensor located inside the monitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62543\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62543 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Mainstream systems are configured for intubated patients. Sidestream systems are configured for both intubated and nonintubated patients.</p><p>Sidestream systems are configured to use high flow rates (around 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/min)</span> or low flow rates (around 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/min)</span>. Flow rates vary according to the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> needed in the breath sample to obtain an accurate reading. Low-flow systems have a lower occlusion rate (from moisture or patient secretions) and are accurate in patients with low tidal volumes (eg, neonates, infants, and adult patients with hypoventilation and low tidal volume breathing). Low-flow systems are also resistant to dilution from supplemental oxygen. High-flow systems sampling at &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/min</span> have been shown to be inaccurate in neonates, infants, young children, and in hypoventilating adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>CO<sub>2</sub> monitors are either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative devices measure the precise end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) either as a number (capnometry) or a number and a waveform (capnography). Qualitative devices report the range in which the EtCO<sub>2</sub> falls (eg, 0 to 10 mmHg or &gt;35 mmHg) as opposed to a precise value (eg, 38 mmHg). </p><p>The most commonly used qualitative capnometric device is the colorimetric EtCO<sub>2</sub> detector. This device consists of a piece of specially treated litmus paper that changes color when exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> (purple for EtCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;3 mmHg; tan for 3 to 15 mmHg; and yellow for &gt;15 mmHg). Its primary use is for verification of ETT placement. Exhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> from an ETT placed in the trachea will change the color of the litmus paper from purple to yellow. An improperly placed ETT in the esophagus will not conduct CO<sub>2</sub> and no change will occur in the color of the litmus paper, which will remain purple. When evaluating studies of EtCO<sub>2</sub>, it is essential to distinguish those involving qualitative measurements (colorimetric) from those describing quantitative methods with a graphic waveform display (capnography). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Placement with proof'</a>.)</p><p>Capnography uses infrared (IR) radiation to make measurements. Molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> absorb IR radiation at a very specific wavelength (4.26 &micro;m), with the amount of radiation absorbed having a nearly exponential relation to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration present in the breath sample. Detecting these changes in IR radiation levels, using appropriate photo-detectors sensitive in this spectral region, allows for the calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the gas sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CO2 WAVEFORM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The capnogram consists of four phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67700 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 1 (dead space ventilation, A-B) represents the beginning of exhalation where the dead space is cleared from the upper airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 2 (ascending phase, B-C) represents the rapid rise in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration in the breath stream as the CO<sub>2</sub> from the alveoli reaches the upper airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 3 (alveolar plateau, C-D) represents the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reaching a uniform level in the entire breath stream from alveolus to nose. Point D, occurring at the end of the alveolar plateau, represents the maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the end of the tidal breath and is appropriately named the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>). This is the number that appears on the monitor display.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 4 (D-E) represents the inspiratory cycle.</p><p/><p>Patients with normal lung function have characteristic rectangular capnograms and narrow gradients between their alveolar CO<sub>2</sub> (ie, EtCO<sub>2</sub>) and arterial CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 0 to 5 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67700 \">figure 1</a>). Gas in the physiologic dead space accounts for this normal gradient.</p><p>Patients with obstructive lung disease have impaired expiratory flow, and demonstrate a more rounded ascending phase and an upward slope in the alveolar plateau (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64586 \">figure 2</a>). In patients with abnormal lung function and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, the EtCO<sub>2</sub>-PaCO<sub>2</sub> gradient widens depending on the severity of the lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The EtCO<sub>2</sub> in patients with lung disease is only useful for assessing trends in ventilatory status over time; isolated EtCO<sub>2</sub> values may or may not correlate with the PaCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR INTUBATED PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnography can be used in intubated patients for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verification of endotracheal tube (ETT) placement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous monitoring of tube location during transport</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gauging effectiveness of resuscitation and prognosis during cardiac arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indicator of ROSC during chest compressions </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titrating end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) levels in patients with suspected increases in intracranial pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining prognosis in trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining adequacy of ventilation</p><p/><p>A table summarizing capnographic findings in different clinical scenarios is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78408%7EEM%2F57493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78408 graphicRef57493 \">figure 3A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Verification of ETT placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unrecognized misplaced intubation (UMI) is defined as the placement of an ETT in a location other than the trachea that is unrecognized by the clinician. UMI has disastrous consequences and has been extensively documented in the emergency medical services (EMS) literature, with reported rates ranging from 7 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/6-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-18</a>]. UMI is unacceptable and widespread use of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring along with other verification techniques has helped to prevent it. The role of EtCO<sub>2</sub> in confirming ETT placement is discussed below; other methods and our recommendations for verifying ETT placement are discussed in detail separately. A crucial point is that correct ETT placement must be verified immediately following every tracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Confirming proper tracheal tube placement'</a>.)</p><p>Following intubation, the presence of a waveform with all four phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67700 \">figure 1</a>) indicates the ETT is through the vocal cords. A normal waveform can occur when the tube has been placed in the right mainstem bronchus. In addition, a waveform resembling tracheal placement may be present for a few breaths with an ETT placed in the hypopharynx just above the vocal cords, but over time these waveforms are likely to become erratic due to movement of the ETT, suggesting that the ETT is not properly placed. A flatline waveform generally indicates esophageal placement but can uncommonly occur in several other situations, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ETT obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete airway obstruction distal to the ETT (eg, foreign body)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical malfunction of the monitor or tubing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged cardiac arrest with diffuse cellular death (in which no CO<sub>2</sub> is produced because of an absence of cellular respiration and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the pulmonary bed is severely compromised). Nevertheless, a four phase capnographic waveform may be present upon initial intubation in cardiac arrest patients, indicating that the tube is correctly positioned in the trachea. In this situation, tube placement should be verified if a flatline tracing subsequently develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p>The accuracy of EtCO<sub>2</sub> to confirm tracheal location of an ETT varies with the technology used and the condition of the patient. For patients who are not in cardiac arrest, studies of qualitative colorimetric EtCO<sub>2</sub> and quantitative capnography have demonstrated 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity for tracheal placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. In contrast, clinical assessment using physical signs is unreliable for determining ETT location. Fogging or condensation of the tube occurs in 83 percent of esophageal intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and chest wall movement can be produced by tracheal or esophageal tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Anesthesiologists, under ideal operating room conditions, using breath sounds as the sole means of verification, incorrectly identify ETT location in 16 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although the accuracy of EtCO<sub>2</sub> for verifying ETT placement in patients with spontaneous circulation approaches 100 percent, sensitivities for tracheal placement vary greatly in cardiac arrest patients, ranging from 62 to 100 percent, depending on the modality used and the duration of the arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/4,5,10,23,24,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10,23,24,27-30</a>]. In patients with low perfusion states and cadavers, studies using quantitative modalities (ie, capnography) for determining tracheal location of the ETT have shown 100 percent sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/19,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31-33</a>]. Studies using qualitative (ie, colorimetric) EtCO<sub>2</sub> methods have shown variable sensitivity, because the exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can fall below the detection threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/10,23,24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23,24,29</a>].</p><p>Overall, capnography appears to be highly accurate in determining ETT location, and we advocate its use in <strong>ALL</strong> patients who are intubated. Physical assessment and assessment of capnographic waveform (capnogram) should be considered secondary methods of verifying ETT placement. Nevertheless, the small number of esophageal intubations in studies assessing the accuracy of capnography for determining ETT placement in cardiac arrest patients limits the strength of these studies. Capnography's true specificity for detecting esophageal intubation in cardiac arrest patients is not certain.</p><p>When capnography provides a waveform for an intubated patient in cardiac arrest, the ETT can be assumed to be within the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. An absent (flatline) waveform may indicate esophageal or placement above the trachea. Early in cardiac arrest, and when the patient is receiving effective CPR, complete failure of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange is unlikely, and the clinician should assume esophageal intubation exists if a waveform is absent. In patients with prolonged cardiac arrest and an absent waveform, the clinician should also assume an esophageal intubation exists. Physical examination criteria, such as repeat laryngoscopy and auscultation of the lungs and epigastrium, may be used, but the clinician must be aware of their limitations in discriminating between esophageal and tracheal intubation. Algorithms for ETT verification are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71442%7EEM%2F58659\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71442 graphicRef58659 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Confirming proper tracheal tube placement'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to verification and monitoring of ETT placement, capnography provides similar information about the placement of alternate advanced airway devices (laryngeal tube airway, laryngeal mask airway, esophageal-tracheal combitube). </p><p>The accuracy of EtCO<sub>2</sub> for confirming ETT location can help clinicians faced with difficult airway management decisions. As an example, in a case involving one of the authors, a patient resuscitated following a submersion injury became difficult to ventilate and hypotensive following RSI, but the presence of a waveform reassured clinicians about ETT placement, allowing them to consider other reasons for decompensation. Decompression of the patient&rsquo;s distended stomach with an orogastric tube resolved the difficulties with ventilation and blood pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring ETT location during transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UMI has catastrophic consequences, and can occur when an ETT is dislodged during patient transport. Continuous monitoring of ETT location during transport prevents UMI. EtCO<sub>2</sub> confirmation of initial ETT placement and continuous capnographic monitoring of ETT location is an accepted standard of care by the American Society of Anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and is recommended as the most reliable method by other national organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>A prospective, observational study of 153 prehospital intubations found a 23 percent UMI rate among patients without continuous EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring, while patients with continuously monitored EtCO<sub>2</sub> sustained the desired 0 percent UMI rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The attached figures depict one airway confirmation algorithm using colorimetric CO<sub>2</sub> detectors and another using capnography. They can be used for both prehospital and in-hospital intubated patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71442%7EEM%2F58659\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71442 graphicRef58659 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of CPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1980s, studies using animal models showed that EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels reflect cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and can be used as a noninvasive measure of cardiac output. A landmark study in 1988 demonstrated this principle in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. During cardiac arrest, when alveolar ventilation and metabolism are essentially constant, EtCO<sub>2</sub> reflects pulmonary blood flow. Therefore, EtCO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of cardiac compressions. As effective CPR leads to a higher cardiac output, EtCO<sub>2</sub> will rise, reflecting the increase in perfusion.</p><p>The measurement of EtCO<sub>2</sub> varies directly with the cardiac output produced by chest compression and has been described in both EMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Both of these prospective, observational studies found an EtCO<sub>2</sub> level &lt;3 mmHg immediately after cardiac arrest, with a higher level generated during cardiac compressions and a mean peak &gt;7.5 mmHg just before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This peak in EtCO<sub>2</sub> level is the earliest sign of ROSC and may occur before return of a palpable pulse or blood pressure. Another observational study of data collected during human CPR found a positive correlation between the depth of chest compressions and EtCO<sub>2</sub> (10 mm increase in compression depth increased EtCO<sub>2</sub> by 1.4 mmHg), as well as ventilation rate and EtCO<sub>2</sub> (increase of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute</span> decreased ETCO<sub>2</sub> by 3 mmHg), and confirmed that higher EtCO<sub>2</sub> values during CPR correlate with increased ROSC and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Return of spontaneous circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During cardiac arrest, EtCO<sub>2</sub> is the earliest indicator of the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. When the heart restarts, the dramatic increase in cardiac output, and resulting increase in perfusion, leads to a rapid increase in EtCO<sub>2</sub> as the CO<sub>2</sub> that has accumulated during cardiac arrest is effectively transported to the lungs and exhaled. This process manifests as a sudden rise in EtCO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness of CPR'</a> above.)</p><p>American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiac resuscitation emphasize the importance of continuing chest compressions without interruption until a perfusing rhythm is reestablished. Experimental evidence indicates that interruptions in chest compressions are followed by sustained periods of reduced blood flow, which only gradually return to pre-interruption levels. Capnogram monitoring virtually eliminates the need to stop chest compressions to check for pulses. Reestablishment of a perfusing rhythm is accompanied immediately by a dramatic increase in EtCO<sub>2</sub>. Once this rise in EtCO<sub>2</sub> is noted, chest compressions can safely be stopped while cardiac rhythm and blood pressure are assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. </p><p>According to an observational study of 145 patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest, several seconds may be required after electrical conversion to a potentially perfusing rhythm before effective mechanical contractions and a subsequent rise in EtCO<sub>2</sub> occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Accordingly, stopping compressions in response to a rhythm change in order to check for a pulse may result in degradation of the rhythm, as coronary perfusion had not yet been restored. EtCO2 is a more reliable harbinger of reperfusion than a pulse check. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels have been shown to correlate with ROSC. As an example, in a systematic review of 17 observational studies in over 6100 adults with cardiac arrest, which included metaanalyses of data from five studies, EtCO<sub>2</sub> &ge;10 to 20 mmHg during CPR was strongly associated with ROSC while persistent EtCO<sub>2</sub> below 10 mmHg after 20 minutes of CPR had a 0.5 percent likelihood of ROSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis in cardiac arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several prospective, observational studies, EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels of &le;10 mmHg measured 20 minutes after the initiation of advanced cardiac life support accurately predicted death in adult patients with cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>].

Researchers found results consistent with these animal experiments in a prospective, observational study of prehospital victims of cardiac arrest.

Sustained hyperventilation (defined as PaCO<sub>2</sub> &le;30 mmHg) is also detrimental and is associated with worse neurologic outcome in severely brain-injured patients.

Unlike pulse oximetry, capnography does not misinterpret motion artifact and provides reliable readings in low perfusion states.</p><p>Capnography is the only monitoring modality that is accurate and reliable in actively seizing patients because the capnogram is determined entirely by respiratory activity and is not confounded by muscle activity or movement artifact. Capnographic data (respiratory rate, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, and capnogram) can be used to distinguish among:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizing patients with apnea (flatline waveform, no EtCO<sub>2</sub> readings, and no chest wall movement)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizing patients with ineffective ventilation (small waveforms, low EtCO<sub>2</sub> values), and</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizing patients with effective ventilation (normal CO<sub>2</sub> waveform, EtCO<sub>2</sub> values).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute respiratory distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnography provides dynamic monitoring of ventilatory status in patients with acute respiratory distress from any cause, including: bronchiolitis, croup, asthma, cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Preliminary research suggests that quantitative capnography can discriminate between heart failure and COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>By measuring EtCO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rate with each breath, capnography provides instantaneous feedback on the clinical status of the patient. Respiratory rate is measured directly from the airway (nose and mouth) with oral or nasal cannula, providing a more reliable reading than impedance respiratory monitoring. In upper airway obstruction and laryngospasm, impedance monitoring detects chest wall movement, interprets this as a valid breath, and displays a respiratory rate, even though the patient is not ventilating. In contrast, capnography detects no ventilation and shows a flatline waveform.</p><p>Clinicians can rapidly assess EtCO<sub>2</sub> trends. A patient with a respiratory rate of 30 will generate 150 EtCO<sub>2</sub> readings in five minutes. This provides sufficient information to determine whether the patient's ventilation is worsening despite treatment (increasing EtCO<sub>2</sub>), stabilizing (stable EtCO<sub>2</sub>), or improving (decreasing EtCO<sub>2</sub>). As an example, increasing EtCO<sub>2</sub> would reflect the worsening ventilation of an acutely tachypneic patient with obstructive lung disease who is developing respiratory muscle fatigue or a more severe lower airway obstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedural sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnography can rapidly detect the common adverse airway and respiratory events associated with procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), including: apnea, upper airway obstruction, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and respiratory depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77403 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/63,65-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65-70</a>]. Respiratory depression caused by oversedation will manifest an abnormally high or low EtCO<sub>2</sub> well before pulse oximetry detects a falling oxyhemoglobin saturation, especially in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. In one randomized trial, the median time between the onset of respiratory depression, as determined by EtCO<sub>2</sub>, and hypoxia was 60 seconds (range 5 to 240 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>The combination of absent chest wall movement and a flatline waveform differentiates apnea from upper airway obstruction or laryngospasm, both of which manifest chest wall movement. Response to airway alignment maneuvers (eg, chin lift, jaw thrust) can often distinguish upper airway obstruction from laryngospasm. The appearance of the characteristic curved capnogram of obstructive lung disease in patients without chronic lung disease indicates bronchospasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64586\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64586 \">figure 2</a>). EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels greater than 70 mmHg in patients without COPD indicate respiratory failure.</p><p>In multiple randomized trials, performed in both the emergency department and endoscopy suites, patients monitored with capnography in addition to standard care experienced significantly fewer episodes of hypoxia than those monitored in standard fashion without capnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/71-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-75</a>].</p><p>Of note, the administration of supplemental oxygen renders pulse oximetry ineffective as an early warning device for respiratory depression during PSA. Thus, capnography is strongly encouraged when supplemental oxygen is used, as its readings are not affected by the presence or absence of additional oxygen. The performance of PSA is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although uncommon, in spontaneously breathing patients receiving high flow oxygen during procedural sedation, the capnographic waveform may be diminished or extinguished if the flow of oxygen displaces the expired carbon dioxide. In this instance, visual inspection of the patient will verify an open airway and ventilatory movements of the chest wall. Transiently reducing O2 flow will result in an immediate restoration of valid waveform and EtCO<sub>2</sub> values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation in obtunded or unconscious patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with altered mental status, including those with alcohol intoxication, intentional or unintentional drug overdose, and postictal patients (especially those treated with benzodiazepines), may have impaired ventilatory function.

As the patient becomes acidotic, HCO3 decreases, causing an increase in minute ventilation, which results in a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. This process results in a decrease in EtCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>By increasing minute ventilation, these patients are able to lower arterial CO<sub>2</sub> tension to help correct their underlying acidemia. The more acidotic the patient, the lower the HCO3, the higher the respiratory rate, and the lower the EtCO<sub>2</sub>. Capnography can be used as an indicator of metabolic acidosis in these patients. In addition, EtCO<sub>2</sub> can be used to distinguish diabetics in ketoacidosis (metabolic acidosis, compensatory tachypnea, and low EtCO<sub>2</sub>) from those who are not (nonacidotic, normal respiratory rate, and normal EtCO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8871711\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis in sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an inverse relationship between EtCO<sub>2</sub> and lactate levels in sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

In a prospective study of 183 patients performed in the prehospital setting, patients with suspected sepsis and an EtCO2 value &le;25 mmHg were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis (78 versus 43 percent) and severe sepsis (47 versus 7 percent), and had higher mortality (11 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capnography is most effective when assessing a pure ventilation, perfusion, or metabolism problem. Capnographic findings in mixed ventilation, perfusion, or metabolism problems are difficult to interpret. In patients with complex pathophysiology, a ventilation problem may elevate end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), while a perfusion problem may simultaneously lower EtCO<sub>2</sub>. As an example, capnography may not provide useful information in a patient with acute pulmonary edema (ventilation problem) from an underlying acute myocardial infarction with decreased cardiac output (perfusion problem).</p><p>In high-flow CO<sub>2</sub> systems, when the tidal volume of the patient drops below the flow rate of the system, the monitor will entrain room air to compensate, falsely diluting the EtCO<sub>2</sub> reading and slurring the ascending phase of the waveform. For this and other reasons, low flow systems are preferred. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Principles of operation'</a> above.)</p><p>Early capnography devices had some difficulty providing consistent measurements in mouth breathing patients and patients who alternated between mouth and nose breathing.

EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is the primary means of confirming tracheal placement of the ETT. Clinical techniques may be used adjunctively, but all have significant limitations in discriminating between esophageal and tracheal intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71442%7EEM%2F58659\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71442 graphicRef58659 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).

A flatline waveform generally indicates esophageal placement but can occur with: ETT obstruction, complete airway obstruction distal to the ETT (eg, foreign body), technical malfunction of the monitor or tubing, and prolonged cardiac arrest.
