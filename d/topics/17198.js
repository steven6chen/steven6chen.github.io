The conduction disturbance can be transient or permanent, with conduction that is delayed, intermittent, or absent. Commonly used terminology includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree AV block &ndash; Slowed conduction without missed beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree AV block &ndash; Missed beats, often in a regular pattern (eg, 2:1, 3:2), or higher degrees of block, which is further classified into Mobitz type I (Wenkebach) and Mobitz II AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree (complete AV) block &ndash; No atrial impulses reach the ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade AV block &ndash; Two or more consecutive blocked P waves.</p><p/><p>The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of third degree (complete) AV block will be discussed here.

Common potentially reversible causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic &ndash; Myocardial ischemia (acute or chronic) involving the conduction system, cardiomyopathy (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), myocarditis (eg, Lyme disease), endocarditis with abscess formation, hyperkalemia, and hypervagotonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic &ndash; Medication-related (AV nodal blocking medications), post-cardiac surgery, post-catheter ablation, post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation.</p><p/><p>Other pathologic causes may be progressive or irreversible (eg, infiltrative malignancies, neuromuscular diseases). However, in half of more of the cases, no specific reversible causes are identified, and the block is felt to be related to idiopathic progressive cardiac conduction disease with myocardial fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sclerosis that affects the conduction system. A more extensive discussion of the etiology of AV block is presented separately. Congenital complete heart block is generally irreversible.

The evaluation of all patients with suspected third degree (complete) AV block includes a thorough history, including medications and recent changes in medications, along with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and bloodwork (which includes serum electrolytes and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577760728\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected third degree (complete) AV block should be questioned about any history of heart disease, both congenital and acquired, as well as any recent cardiac procedures that could predispose to AV conduction abnormalities. Patients without known cardiac disease should be questioned about other systemic diseases associated with heart block (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis). Patients who live in an area with endemic Lyme disease should be questioned about any recent outdoor exposure to ticks or known tick bites. Congenital heart block can be associated with maternal lupus.

Such patients with otherwise unexplained complete heart block should be evaluated for cardiac sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiac-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577760212\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients with third degree (complete) AV block will present with some degree of symptoms, though the severity of the symptoms can be quite variable. Symptoms may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presyncope or syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest</p><p/><p>Most patients will present with some level of fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspnea. These symptoms result from the reduced cardiac output associated with the slower ventricular rate (40 beats per minute or less) of most escape rhythms. Infrequently, patients with a faster escape rhythm (50 to 60 beats per minutes) may have minimal or no symptoms. Conversely, patients with a slower escape rhythm (30 beats per minute or less) are more likely to present with syncope. The absence of any escape rhythm may rarely lead to sudden cardiac death.</p><p>The new onset of bradycardia associated with third degree (complete) AV block may also exacerbate comorbid conditions. Patients with underlying coronary heart disease or heart failure may present with abrupt worsening of their typical angina or heart failure symptoms.</p><p>Very few patients will be entirely asymptomatic with third degree (complete) AV block. The complete absence of symptoms is likely to be seen only in relatively young, otherwise healthy patients with a high junctional escape rhythm and a ventricular heart rate greater than 40 beats per minute. </p><p>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block present with bradycardia but otherwise have few specific physical examination findings. Patients may appear pale or diaphoretic related to the abrupt reduction in cardiac output. Patients with underlying heart failure that is exacerbated by the development of heart block may have crackles on lung examination, elevated jugular venous pulsations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577760257\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block will have evidence of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complexes) activity which are independent of each other on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72863\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72863 \">waveform 1</a>). In nearly all cases, the atrial rate will be faster than the ventricular escape rate, and there will be no association between the P waves and QRS complexes. As a general rule, the more distal the level of block and the resulting escape rhythm, the slower the ventricular rate will be. Junctional rhythms tend to have a ventricular rate between 40 and 60 beats per minute, while ventricular escape rhythms typically have rates of 40 beats per minute or less and often are unstable.</p><p>Escape rhythms occur when a pacemaker other than the sinus node has sufficient time to depolarize, attain threshold, and produce a depolarization. In third degree (complete) AV block, the escape rhythm that controls the ventricles can occur at any level below that of the conduction block and the morphology of the QRS complex can help to determine the location where this is occurring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If third degree AV block occurs within the AV node, about two-thirds of the escape rhythms have a narrow QRS complex (ie, a junctional or AV nodal rhythm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65545\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65545 \">waveform 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Block at the level of the bundle of His is also typically associated with a narrow QRS complex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with infrahisian block have a subjunctional escape rhythm with a wide QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51446\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51446 \">waveform 3</a>).</p><p/><p>If the escape rhythm has a normal QRS duration of less than 120 msec, the block occurs with almost equal frequency in the AV node and the bundle of His [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In comparison, involvement of these sites is infrequent with a prolonged QRS; the block in this setting is in the fascicles or bundle branches in over 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Patients in whom the development of third degree (complete) AV block exacerbates underlying coronary heart disease may have ECG changes consistent with myocardial ischemia (eg, ST segment and T wave changes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H597568554\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis of ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third degree (complete) AV block has a relatively unique appearance on the ECG, with evidence of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complexes) activity which are independent of each other and an atrial rate faster than the ventricular rate. Rarely, complete AV block can occur in which the atrial rate is exactly twice the ventricular rate (eg, atrial rate of 80 beats per minute with a ventricular rate of 40 beats per minute), in which case the appearance on ECG could be similar to that of second degree AV (ie, 2:1) block. However, any slight variation in the exact multiples should result in variations on the ECG that allow the distinction between third degree (complete) AV block and second degree AV block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577760690\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With a very few select exceptions, electrophysiologic studies (EPS) are not necessary in patients with complete AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients with complete AV block, EPS may be indicated when symptoms are not present, the site of block is not apparent, or the block is potentially reversible.

Unstable patients require immediate pharmacologic therapy and, in most instances, should also receive temporary pacing to increase heart rate and cardiac output. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, assessment and treatment for any potentially reversible causes should occur, followed by placement of a permanent pacemaker for patients without an identifiable reversible etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577760787\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block who are hemodynamically unstable should be urgently treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103365\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103365 \">algorithm 1</a>) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and temporary cardiac pacing (either with transcutaneous or, if immediately available, transvenous pacing). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dopamine</a> may be administered in hypotensive patients, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> is an option for patients with heart failure symptoms.

Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability include hypotension, altered mental status, signs of shock, ongoing ischemic chest pain, and evidence of acute pulmonary edema. Such patients should be treated according to the Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol for patients with symptomatic bradycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63919\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63919 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> should be promptly administered if intravenous (IV) access is available, but treatment with atropine should not delay treatment with transcutaneous pacing or a chronotropic agent. The initial dose of atropine is 0.5 mg IV. This dose may be repeated every three to five minutes to a total dose of 3 mg. A favorable response to atropine also suggests that AV block is due to abnormal conduction in the AV node. Atropine is not likely to be effective for patients with an escape rhythm at or below the bundle of His since the more distal conducting system is not as sensitive to vagal activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing should be provided. In the absence of central venous access, the most immediate way to provide temporary cardiac pacing is via transcutaneous pacing.

However, many ventricular escape rhythms are unreliable and potentially unstable, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103365\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103365 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, most stable patients continue to have symptoms related to the bradycardia and will require identification and treatment of any reversible causes or permanent therapy with an implantable pacemaker.</p><p>While stable patients are being monitored, evaluation and treatment should proceed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversible causes of third degree (complete) AV block such as myocardial ischemia, increased vagal tone, hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, and drugs that depress conduction, should be excluded in patients prior to implantation of a permanent pacemaker. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction should be treated with temporary pacing and revascularization; following revascularization, most conduction abnormalities will improve or resolve and will not require permanent pacing.

Third degree (complete) AV block typically improves to lesser degrees of AV block within one week, and more minor conduction disturbances usually resolve within six weeks. As such, while these patients may initially require temporary cardiac pacing, permanent cardiac pacing should be reserved for patients with persistent third degree (complete) AV block following an adequate course of therapy for Lyme disease.

Dual-chamber (ie, atrioventricular) to maintain AV synchrony is preferred (rather than single chamber right ventricular pacing) in most patients due to the favorable hemodynamic benefits of AV synchrony. Some trials suggest that biventricular cardiac pacing (ie, cardiac resynchronization) is superior to standard dual chamber pacing in patients with heart block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Third degree (complete) AV block can occur in the AV node or in the infranodal specialized conduction system. The potential etiologies of third degree (complete) AV block include reversible causes (both pathologic and iatrogenic) as well as idiopathic causes. Common potentially reversible causes include myocardial ischemia, medications, and cardiac procedures.

Most patients will present with some level of fatigue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspnea, and very few patients will be entirely asymptomatic.

In complete heart block, the escape rhythm can occur at any level below that of the conduction block, and the morphology of the QRS complex can help to determine the location at which this is occurring. If third degree AV block occurs within the AV node or the bundle of His, the escape rhythm tends to have a narrow QRS complex, whereas AV block occurring below the bundle of His (ie, infrahisian block) results in a subjunctional escape rhythm with a wide QRS complex. (See <a href=\"#H577760257\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In nearly all cases, the diagnosis of third degree (complete) AV block can be made in a patient with suggestive symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, presyncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope) by obtaining a surface electrocardiogram (ECG), ideally a full 12-lead ECG but sometime a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H577760225\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of the patient with third degree (complete) AV block depends on the presence and severity of any signs and symptoms related to the ventricular escape rhythm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103365\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103365 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unstable patients require immediate pharmacologic therapy and, in most instances, temporary pacing to increase heart rate and cardiac output. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> (initial dose 0.5 mg intravenously) should be promptly administered if IV access is available, but treatment with atropine should not delay treatment with transcutaneous pacing or a chronotropic agent. Temporary cardiac pacing should be provided. In the absence of central venous access, the most immediate way to provide temporary cardiac pacing is via transcutaneous pacing. (See <a href=\"#H577760787\" class=\"local\">'Unstable patients'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporary-cardiac-pacing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporary cardiac pacing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block who are initially hemodynamically stable do not require urgent therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or temporary cardiac pacing. However, many ventricular escape rhythms are unreliable and potentially unstable, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H577760794\" class=\"local\">'Stable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, reversible causes of third degree (complete) AV block such as myocardial ischemia, increased vagal tone, hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, and drugs that depress conduction, should be excluded in patients prior to implantation of a permanent pacemaker. (See <a href=\"#H577760794\" class=\"local\">'Stable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once reversible causes of heart block have been excluded, permanent pacing is usually indicated.
