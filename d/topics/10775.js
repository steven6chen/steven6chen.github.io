The increased dose intensity of anti-resorptive therapy typically prescribed for cancer indications places cancer patients at a substantially higher risk for ONJ than are patients who receive them for other conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>ONJ has also been described as a complication of cancer therapies that target angiogenesis; however, this association is more controversial with the little confirmatory prospective trial data available in the setting of monotherapy with an antiangiogenic agent alone. Use of antiangiogenic agents as a risk factor for medication-related ONJ (MRONJ) among patients receiving antiresorptive agents for cancer is more clearly established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicity-of-molecularly-targeted-antiangiogenic-agents-non-cardiovascular-effects#H1651228672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicity of molecularly targeted antiangiogenic agents: Non-cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will describe the incidence, risk factors, staging, clinical course, prevention strategies, and management of MRONJ in patients with cancer who are receiving antiresorptive agents.

The recognition of jaw necrosis as a complication of other drugs, including the RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B) ligand inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> and antiangiogenic agents prompted a special committee of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) to recommend the term &quot;medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw&quot; as preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664779733\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two working definitions of MRONJ have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A task force convened by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research defines MRONJ as the presence of exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within eight weeks after identification by a health care professional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An updated 2014 position paper on MRONJ is available from the AAOMS that&nbsp;provides an updated definition of the condition; comparative risk estimates of developing MRONJ in patients with cancer and a history of exposure to either antiresorptive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiangiogenic agents; recommendations for prevention measures; and&nbsp;management strategies for patients with established MRONJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96868 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients may be considered to have MRONJ if the following characteristics are present:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Current or previous treatment with antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exposed or necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for more than eight weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No history of radiation therapy to or obvious metastatic disease in the jawbones </p><p/><p>We prefer the AAOMS definition, which has also been adopted by an international task force on osteonecrosis of the jaw [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664776070\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the first cases of MRONJ were reported over a decade ago, the underlying pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. The leading proposed hypotheses to explain the unique localization of MRONJ to the jaws include remodeling or oversuppression of bone resorption, inhibition of blood supply, constant microtrauma, and <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/inflammation</span>. None of these hypotheses seems to explain all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The shared complication of ONJ in cancer patients treated with high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> or potent bisphosphonates strongly suggests that profound and prolonged inhibition of bone resorption with oversuppression of bone remodeling (ie, low bone turnover), and infection are the main mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Animal data support the view that a higher rate of bone remodeling or more severe oversuppression of the bone turnover rate with bisphosphonates in the jawbones may explain the differential predisposition at this site compared with other bones in the axial or appendicular skeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, this is probably not the sole contributor since MRONJ can be, albeit rarely, observed in the absence of antiresorptive therapy. Other animal studies suggest defects in alveolar bone such as dental extractions to be potent initiators for MRONJ, with mucosal or soft tissue damage less likely to induce necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some have postulated that MRONJ is a form of avascular necrosis, possibly caused by inhibition of angiogenesis. In vitro experiments consistently demonstrate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> inhibits angiogenesis, and cancer patients treated with this agent have decreased circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence linking MRONJ to antiangiogenic drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, inhibition of angiogenesis has not been reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> therapy to date. Furthermore, histologic examination of ONJ lesions demonstrates patent vessels in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Thus, it seems unlikely that MRONJ represents a form of avascular necrosis.

Although tooth extraction had been performed in most of the initial reported cases of bisphosphonate-related ONJ, these teeth commonly had preexisting periodontal or periapical disease. Animal models indicate that both inflammation or bacterial infection and systemic administration of antiresorptive agents are sufficient to induce ONJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

Furthermore, it is unclear if the common presence of actinomyces in these lesions is actively contributing to the development or progression of MRONJ, or simply related to the presence of necrotic bone in an anaerobic environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

One review included 18 studies (392 patients undergoing oral surgery in conjunction with APC), four examining APC for prevention of ONJ in the setting of tooth extraction, and the remainder in conjunction with surgical debridement for treatment of established ONJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. Excluding one individual case report, of the three studies on tooth extraction, only one was a randomized comparison between APC (n = 91) and no APC (n = 85); in this study, there were five cases of ONJ in the control group and none in the APC group. However, the quality of evidence in this trial is considered very low based on a high risk of bias in patient selection and outcome assessments. Among the 14 studies examining the use of therapeutic APCs in conjunction with surgical management, four included a group treated with APC and a group that was not treated with APC. A meta-analysis of these four studies showed that patients receiving the APCs had significantly reduced rates of ONJ recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.36). However, there were only five events in the APC group compared with 17 in the control group. The authors concluded that the use of APCs as an adjunct to oral surgery procedures may be of benefit, although the quality of the evidence is limited, and randomized trials are needed. However, it is not known whether use of APCs could have a negative impact on the course of the patient's underlying malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664781589\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage-specific management recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Updated year 2014 guidelines on stage specific management for patients with MRONJ from the AAOMS are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96868 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664779946\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is an uncommon but potentially serious side effect that occurs in cancer patients treated with high-potency bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. The pathophysiology is likely multifactorial, with contributions from impaired bone <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/suppression</span> of osteoclast activity; impaired angiogenesis (particularly in patients treated concurrently with antiangiogenic agents); and local factors, such as poor dental hygiene, including poorly fitting dentures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a dental manipulation of some sort (eg, dental extraction, advanced periodontal disease). (See <a href=\"#H664776070\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of exposed and necrotic bone, which may remain asymptomatic for weeks, months, or even years, are the consistent hallmark of MRONJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Signs and symptoms that may occur before the development of clinically detectable osteonecrosis include prolonged jaw pain, tooth mobility, bone enlargement, gingival swelling, erythema, and ulceration. The mandible is affected twice as often as the maxillary bone. (See <a href=\"#H664776076\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients treated with antiresorptive agents for cancer, the incidence of ONJ is slightly higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> than with bisphosphonates (approximately 1.9 versus 1.3 percent). (See <a href=\"#H664776082\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dentoalveolar surgery is a major risk factor for MRONJ. The best estimate of the absolute risk of developing ONJ following tooth extraction and other dentoalveolar procedures among cancer patients exposed to antiresorptive medications is between 1.6 to 2.8 percent. (See <a href=\"#H934890320\" class=\"local\">'Dentoalveolar surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical staging system for MRONJ with stage-specific recommendations for treatment has been proposed by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96868 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H664776118\" class=\"local\">'Staging and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients being considered for therapy with an antiresorptive agent be examined by a dentist prior to initiation of this treatment and that they have needed dental work performed, including removal of unsalvageable teeth and optimization of periodontal health, prior to initiating therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1184707601\" class=\"local\">'Before initiation of intravenous antiresorptive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During therapy, all patients should practice good oral hygiene, including daily brushing, flossing, and use of antibacterial oral rinses, and attending recommended dental check-ups, denture fittings, and routine cleanings. Patients should inform their dentists they are receiving antiresorptive and antiangiogenic agents so invasive dental procedures, especially extractions, can be avoided while receiving active therapy. Oral exams and hygiene status should be closely monitored by the oncologist during treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1184707614\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients during therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every effort should be made to avoid invasive dental procedures involving removal of teeth or involving the jawbones in patients who are receiving therapy with an antiresorptive agent. At present, no recommendations based on clinical studies can be made as to the benefit of discontinuing at-risk therapies for a short period of time (ie, &quot;drug holiday&quot;) prior to necessary invasive dental procedures. However, it is reasonable to withhold the antiresorptive agent for two to three months before and after the invasive procedure and then restart after the mucosa has healed if doing so is consistent with the oncologic goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H1098730857\" class=\"local\">'Cessation of at-risk medication prior to invasive dental procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop ONJ while receiving therapy with an antiresorptive agent, recommendations on management are hindered by a lack of evidence. We suggest conservative management with limited debridement, antibiotic therapy as needed, and topical mouth rinses rather than aggressive surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conservative therapy may result in healing in a significant proportion of patients. Surgical resection of necrotic bone should be reserved for refractory or advanced cases and should be undertaken only by dentists or oral surgeons familiar with MRONJ. (See <a href=\"#H664781551\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of established MRONJ'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stage-specific management recommendations for MRONJ are available from the AAOMS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96868 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H664781589\" class=\"local\">'Stage-specific management recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no prospective data to advise the patient or physician as to the benefits of discontinuing therapy with the antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agent, and there is no consensus on this point. While discontinuation of the offending agent might stabilize sites of ONJ, reduce the risk of developing new sites, and control symptoms, treatment discontinuation could also result in a recurrence of bone pain or an increase in skeletal-related events for patients receiving antiresorptive therapy in the setting of bone metastases, and a worsening of disease status in patients receiving antiangiogenic agents. (See <a href=\"#H1184708693\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuation of the at-risk agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many clinicians, including one of the authors, discontinue therapy, at least temporarily, and restart after resolution or signs of improvement or stabilization. However, others, including the other author, continue monthly treatment as long as the patient has not had a recent dental extraction, subsequently discontinuing the drug if the ONJ worsens significantly. Because of the rarity of this complication, there is unlikely to be a prospective clinical trial to answer this question. The decision must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the estimated risks and benefits for an individual patient.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Edwards BJ, Gounder M, McKoy JM, et al.
