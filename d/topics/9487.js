This happens when veins or arteries in the intestines are blocked. It can happen in the large intestine or the small intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). It can cause belly pain, nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11643993\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ischemic bowel disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain &ndash; This can be mild or severe. It can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Start suddenly, or happen over several days or years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Start about 1 hour after eating, and last about 2 hours. Eating a big meal can make this pain even worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or both</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in bowel movements &ndash; This can be bloody diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss, when not trying to lose weight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating problems, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Food fear &ndash; Not wanting to eat because pain starts after eating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling full too quickly when eating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11644008\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about the symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also order one or more tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-ray, CT scan, or ultrasound of the belly &ndash; These imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can help show the cause of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These can show signs of not enough nutrition. Or they might show that a different condition is causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests called &quot;endoscopy,&quot; &quot;upper endoscopy,&quot; &quot;sigmoidoscopy,&quot; or &quot;colonoscopy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>) &ndash; For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube down your throat and into your stomach, or up your rectum and into your colon. The tube has a camera attached so the doctor can look inside your body. The tube also has tools attached to it, which the doctor can use to take samples of tissue. These samples can go to the lab to be checked for problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called an &quot;angiogram&quot; &ndash; For this test, the doctor injects a dye into the vessels that carry blood to the bowel. This dye can be seen with an imaging test such as a CT, MR, or fluoroscopy (a moving X-ray). The test can show if arteries around the bowel are blocked. If they are, this could be keeping part of the bowel from getting enough blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy &ndash; This is a procedure that the doctor does in the operating room. The doctor makes a small cut near the belly button. Then he or she puts a small device called a &quot;laparoscope&quot; inside. The doctor looks through the laparoscope to see if he or she can find the cause of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11644025\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ischemic bowel disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for ischemic bowel disease depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is blocking the blood vessels </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of vessel is blocked, an artery (which brings blood to the bowel) or a vein (which drains blood from the bowel)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the symptoms started suddenly or came on over a long time</p><p/><p>Most people with ischemic bowel disease need treatment in the hospital. In the hospital, the doctor can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you fluids and nutrition through a small tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a thin tube called a &quot;nasogastric tube&quot; in your nose, down your esophagus, and into your stomach. If there is extra fluid and air in your stomach or intestines, the tube can suck it up. This will make you feel better and help keep you from vomiting.</p><p/><p>Other treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics to treat infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to open a blocked artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-clotting medicines (sometimes called &quot;blood thinners&quot;) to reduce clotting in the vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to take out part of the bowel if it is not healthy</p><p/><p>These treatments can help the bowel work correctly again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11644040\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-abdomen-belly-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute abdomen (belly pain) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upset-stomach-functional-dyspepsia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upset stomach (functional dyspepsia) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
