For most children, gender assignment correlates with gender identity, which is the innate sense of maleness or femaleness. However, some children have a gender identity that does not correlate with assigned gender. These children are called gender-nonconforming, gender-variant, or sometimes transgender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86993 \">table 1</a>).

Given the spectrum and fluidity of gender identity, it is important for health care providers to elicit and understand the specific gender needs of individual patients. The degree and type of mental health and medical support and interventions may vary. Not all gender-nonconforming youth desire phenotypic transformation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians who are neither comfortable nor willing to become sufficiently knowledgeable to treat transgender patients should refer them to more experienced colleagues.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25477604\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83439611\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental health interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967321736\"><span class=\"h3\">Mental health approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mental health approaches to help gender-nonconforming children and adolescents explore their gender identity and find a gender role that is comfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. Treatment options may be influenced by family expectations, cultural differences, opinions of health professionals, insurance coverage, and availability of services.</p><p>The specific approach for a given child or adolescent is individualized. The process may or may not involve recommendations for a change in gender expression or body modification; what helps to alleviate gender dysphoria in one person may be very different from what helps to alleviate it in another.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Affirming</strong> &ndash; Affirming approaches focus on gender <span class=\"nowrap\">identity/body</span> congruence and actively promote exploration of gender development and self-definition within a safe setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. A fundamental concept of this approach is that gender nonconformity is not a mental illness. There is no need to pathologize the child or adolescent's behaviors or to assign a diagnosis. With the help of affirming psychotherapy, some individuals can integrate their cross-gender feelings into the gender they were assigned at birth; others may be able to alleviate their gender dysphoria through changes in gender role and expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H65066665\" class=\"local\">'Social transition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The authors of this topic review support affirming approaches &ndash; from medical and mental health professionals, as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/caregivers</span> &ndash; for gender-nonconforming youth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wait-and-see</strong> &ndash; Some caregivers take a wait-and-see approach: waiting to see how the child's gender identity changes as he or she gets older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Caregivers who take the wait-and-see approach may allow cross-gender play and clothing within the home. Caregivers may also support participation in both masculine and feminine activities as the child explores their interests in other social settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Redirection</strong> &ndash; Some mental health therapists encourage caregivers to use positive reinforcement to try to &quot;redirect&quot; children toward behavior that is more typical of their genotypic sex or less gender specific. The goal of redirection is that the gender-nonconforming desires and expressions may disappear over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Negative reinforcement (eg, shaming the child for gender-nonconforming expression) has significant negative mental and social health consequences and should be avoided at all costs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reparative therapy</strong> &ndash; Families who have great difficulty accepting their gender-nonconforming child might seek the help of mental health professionals who practice reparative therapy (also called conversion therapy), claiming to be able to &quot;cure&quot; a transgender identity. This approach was initially used in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Reparative therapy is considered <strong>unhelpful and potentially harmful</strong> by most professional organizations, including the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,26,27</a>].

Social transition also may include wearing make-up or clothing modification to hide the effects of puberty (eg, wearing a binder to hide breast development, tucking the penis and testicles so they are not visible, wearing protheses or packers to simulate body parts), and using devices that permit urination while standing (for affirmed males).</p><p>Patients and families may decide to have a &quot;trial run&quot; to allow the child to see how it feels and the parents and health care providers to see how the child responds. Patients and families decide in advance the extent of the transition (eg, clothing, pronouns, name), whether and to whom to disclose the transition, and how to handle common potential challenges (eg, bathrooms, locker rooms, sleepovers, etc).</p><p>Decisions regarding social transition are made on a patient-by-patient basis after considering the potential risks (eg, safety concerns) and benefits (eg, alleviation of psychologic distress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The effects of social transition on future physical and mental health continue to evolve. Longitudinal studies suggest that symptoms of anxiety and depression in gender-nonconforming children improve with social and physical transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and that among socially transitioned children, parent- and child-reported rates of depression are similar to rates in nontransgender age- and gender-matched controls, nontransgender sibling controls, and typical rates, while rates of anxiety are only slightly higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In these studies, the levels of depression and anxiety symptoms were lower than those reported in previous studies in children with gender nonconformity who were not socially transitioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].</p><p>The safety of the child or adolescent and the likelihood of acceptance in the community are important considerations in making decisions about social transition.

However, it is important that parental assessment of the potential for danger is accurate. For parents who are unsure about the social transition or have difficulty accepting their gender-nonconforming child, safety concerns may be used to delay social transition. Families can contact a number of local or national social and advocacy agencies to assist in making a safety assessment or in facilitating a social transition in school. Such organizations work with schools, teachers, and students to assist in developing transition planning with bathroom and locker room accommodations, registration questions, and overall education about gender-related issues. The involvement of these agencies allows parents to focus on parenting their gender-nonconforming child rather than bringing about social change. (See <a href=\"#H233854\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Parents of children and adolescents who are socially transitioned may request a &quot;safe letter&quot; from their child's medical or mental health provider to describe their child's situation in an effort to preempt discrimination or problems with authorities (eg, protective services, law enforcement, other institutional authorities) who are unfamiliar with gender nonconformity. Information to be included in a safe letter can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.imatyfa.org/&amp;token=McmUHzbivMBbVmUkgiAMB5ZAvBlXpyjSzAL/4EIrTuE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=86771\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TransYouth Family Allies website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65066672\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal interventions (eg, suppression of endogenous puberty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initiation of gender-affirming hormones to alter secondary sexual characteristics) may be beneficial for adolescents with gender nonconformity and strong feelings of gender dysphoria after the onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In the experience of the authors of this topic review, social transition is beneficial for some prepubertal children with persistent, strong nonconforming gender identity who have difficulty functioning adequately in their familial, social, and educational domains without being allowed to express their authentic gender identity. The potential for negative response and safety concerns (including bullying, harassment, rejection, isolation, and violence &ndash; which may be happening even without social transitioning) must be balanced with the child's becoming incapacitated by living inauthentically.

However, access to multidisciplinary centers may be limited. As more providers become informed, trained, and adept at working with gender and sexual minorities, youth and families may have additional options for care within primary care and community mental health venues.</p><p>Given the spectrum and fluidity of gender identity, the management needs and goals differ from adolescent to adolescent. Adolescents may change their transition goals and requests for treatment over time according to personal desire and circumstance. Some gender-nonconforming youth do not desire a phenotypic transition and are content with their endogenous hormones. They may identify as transgender, or they may identify as something completely different (eg, &quot;gender fluid,&quot; &quot;gender creative&quot;). It is important for providers to try to understand the individual needs of each patient.

Some youth are uncomfortable making changes in their gender presentation before undergoing significant hormonal intervention because of fear of harassment, bullying, and physical violence. It is important for providers to honor the needs of each youth and to understand the strategic decision making during transition that allows the youth to feel most comfortable and safe. Youth who make the decision to socially transition after starting hormones should not have their care delayed.

Although there has been no published information about using hormones to induce partial development of secondary sexual characteristics, clinicians who see large numbers of transgender youth report an increase in patients who are interested only in male chest reconstruction or testosterone suppression.</p><p>The challenge of the care team is to work with such youth to determine how they want to present their experienced gender to the outside world. Nonbinary-identified youth require providers who are open-minded and skilled at eliciting information that differentiates gender identity from gender expression and can work with youth to develop interventions that meet their individual needs. Depending upon their level of discomfort related to the mismatch between gender identity and anatomic sex, youth with a nonbinary gender identity may or may not want to take gender-affirming hormones; some may desire a low-level dose to maintain a more androgynous effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113274158\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF HORMONAL INTERVENTIONS FOR ADOLESCENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65066949\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal interventions to suppress puberty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> promote development of cross-gender secondary sexual characteristics may be beneficial in gender-nonconforming youth whose desire to be of another gender is persistent, consistent, and intensifies with the onset of pubertal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,6,12,37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12,37,39,40</a>].

Adolescents who are unable to afford or access hormonal interventions may decide to purchase hormones online or on the street and use them without medical supervision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>When gender specialty centers are not available (which is more often than not), the WPATH standards of care recommend that the clinician providing and monitoring hormonal treatment be well versed in the relevant medical and psychologic aspects of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Such clinicians may be board-certified endocrinologists or adolescent medicine specialists, but many gender specialists have other medical backgrounds with additional training in gender and sexual health and adolescent health. Without additional training and expertise, most primary care providers are uncomfortable with initial evaluations and starting youth on hormones. However, in order to improve access and patient-centered care, primary care providers are instrumental in coordinating care, providing referrals, and providing clinical and laboratory monitoring for patients receiving hormonal interventions. In addition, given the prior relationship with a child and family, primary care providers can be powerful role models for support, positive regard, and acceptance of transition for the youth and family members.

However, GnRH analogs alone provide little benefit for patients who present in late puberty, when irreversible secondary sexual characteristics are already well developed (eg, breasts, Adam's apple, voice deepening, etc). For such patients, gender-affirming hormone therapy may be more appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H231909\" class=\"local\">'Gender-affirming hormone therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of GnRH analogs in conjunction with gender-affirming hormones allows for the induction of a more peer-concordant male puberty in genotypic females. For example, a 13- or 14-year-old who has already achieved Tanner 5 development might be a good candidate for starting testosterone, but the testosterone dose necessary to suppress menses would result in age-inappropriate masculinization. Concurrent administration of GnRH analogs would suppress menses while allowing peer-concordant masculinization through progressive testosterone dose escalation. Genotypic males who identify as transfeminine can also benefit from concurrent GnRH analogs and gender-affirming hormones. Reduction in androgen production by central LH suppression (via GnRH analogs) is far superior to peripheral blockade of androgen synthesis and action (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H231831\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management for gender-nonconforming youth is determined according to the individual's gender development, needs, and goals. The safety and wellbeing of the youth and his or her family members is foremost. (See <a href=\"#H231838\" class=\"local\">'Guiding principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options may be influenced by family expectations, cultural differences, opinions of health professionals, insurance coverage, and availability of services. We support an affirming mental health approach. Reparative therapies, which claim to &quot;cure&quot; transgender identity, are considered unhelpful and potentially harmful by most professional organizations. (See <a href=\"#H83439611\" class=\"local\">'Mental health interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenotypic interventions include social transition (ie, living partially or completely in the preferred gender role by adapting hairstyle, clothing, pronouns, and possibly a new name) and hormonal interventions to suppress endogenous puberty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alter secondary sexual characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H65066672\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the unpredictability of the trajectory of gender nonconformity in prepubertal children, it seems reasonable for the primary care provider to offer education, support, and referral to mental health providers as indicated for those with evidence of gender dysphoria; coexisting anxiety, depression, or suicidality; or significant interpersonal conflicts with peers (eg, bullying) or parents. (See <a href=\"#H25477379\" class=\"local\">'Approach in prepubertal children'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4186224553\" class=\"local\">'Indications for mental health referral'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gender-development-and-clinical-presentation-of-gender-nonconformity-in-children-and-adolescents#H462800773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gender development and clinical presentation of gender nonconformity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Role of the medical provider'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender dysphoria that persists through the onset of puberty or is increased at the onset of puberty is unlikely to subside. For adolescents with gender dysphoria, most gender specialists suggest a supportive, affirming approach with an interdisciplinary team that includes medical and mental health specialists. The management needs and goals differ from adolescent to adolescent. (See <a href=\"#H25477701\" class=\"local\">'Approach in pubertal children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To allow time for the adolescent to develop the maturity necessary to make a thorough and informed decision about permanent physical changes, medical interventions generally progress from reversible (eg, social transition, pubertal suppression), to partially reversible interventions (eg, gender-affirming hormones), to irreversible interventions (eg, surgical interventions). (See <a href=\"#H25477701\" class=\"local\">'Approach in pubertal children and adolescents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H65066665\" class=\"local\">'Social transition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H113274158\" class=\"local\">'Overview of hormonal interventions for adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal interventions to suppress puberty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> promote development of cross-gender secondary sexual characteristics may be beneficial for gender-nonconforming youth whose desire to be of the other gender is persistent, consistent, and intensifies with the onset of pubertal changes. Youth with intense feelings of gender dysphoria are at risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes.
