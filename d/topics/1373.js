The most common causes are the enteroviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional etiologies include other infections (mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes), parameningeal infections, medications, and malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79745 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Aseptic meningitis often has a similar presentation to that of bacterial meningitis (ie, fever, headache, altered mental status, stiff neck, photophobia), which can be a life-threatening illness. However, in contrast to bacterial meningitis, many patients with aseptic meningitis (particularly those who have disease caused by viruses or medications) have a self-limited course that will resolve without specific therapy.</p><p>The assessment of patients with probable aseptic meningitis is complicated by the large number of potential etiologic agents and the relatively limited diagnostic tools for identifying specific pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms, signs, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings for various etiologies of aseptic meningitis will be reviewed here. Each diagnostic entity is discussed in detail separately on the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS VERSUS ENCEPHALITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of normal brain function is the important distinguishing feature between encephalitis and meningitis. Patients with meningitis may be lethargic or distracted by headache, but their cerebral function remains normal. In contrast, patients with encephalitis commonly present with abnormalities in brain function such as altered mental status, motor or sensory deficits, altered behavior and personality changes, and speech or movement disorders. Seizures and postictal states can be seen with meningitis alone and should not be construed as definitive evidence of encephalitis. Other neurologic manifestations include hemiparesis, flaccid paralysis, and paresthesias.</p><p>However, the distinction between the two entities is frequently blurred since some patients may have both a parenchymal and meningeal process with clinical features of both. The patient is usually labeled as having meningitis or encephalitis based upon which features predominate in the illness although meningoencephalitis is also a common term that recognizes the overlap. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRAL MENINGITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of viruses produce aseptic meningitis including enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus (WNV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), mumps, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteroviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aseptic meningitis occurring during the summer or fall is most likely to be caused by enteroviruses (eg, Coxsackievirus, echovirus, other non-poliovirus enteroviruses), the most common causes of viral meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, seasonal variation of certain CNS viral infections is relative and not absolute. Enteroviruses continue to cause 6 to 10 percent of cases of viral meningitis in the winter and spring despite their predilection for inciting illness in the late summer and fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The presenting signs and symptoms of enteroviral meningitis are not distinctive. The onset of symptoms is characteristically abrupt and typically includes headache, fever, nausea or vomiting, malaise, photophobia, and meningismus. Rash, diarrhea, and upper respiratory symptoms may also be present.</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are typical of other viral meningitides and include a white blood cell (WBC) count that is generally less than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> a modest elevation in CSF protein concentration (generally less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and a normal glucose concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebrospinal fluid: Physiology and utility of an examination in disease states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Up to two-thirds of patients with enteroviral meningitis have a polymorphonuclear predominance in the CSF when examined early in the course of the illness. Repeat lumbar puncture after 12 to 24 hours, if performed, generally shows an evolution to a lymphocytic predominance. </p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for enteroviruses can be considered if a definitive diagnosis is desired, or in the setting of an outbreak situation, but is not necessary in all patients. CSF nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for enteroviruses yield sensitivities that range from 86 to 100 percent and specificities that range from 92 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among patients with CNS manifestations and a negative CSF NAAT, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract specimens for enterovirus may be useful to establish a diagnosis of enterovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, detection of enterovirus from the throat or stool of an individual with aseptic meningitis may represent an infection that occurred weeks previously and is unrelated to the present syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Additional discussions of enterovirus infections are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary infection with HIV frequently presents as a mononucleosis-like syndrome manifested by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, rash, and pharyngitis. A subset of these patients will develop meningitis or meningoencephalitis, manifested by headache, confusion, seizures or cranial nerve palsies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Pathogenesis and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most patients with HIV-1 meningitis, the clinical findings resolve without treatment, and patients may be erroneously assumed to have a benign cause of viral meningitis. Thus, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for primary HIV infection in patients at increased risk for acquisition of this virus. The identification of the patient with acute HIV infection is also important from a public health viewpoint since the risk of transmission is facilitated by high levels of viremia.</p><p>The CSF profile characteristically has a lymphocytic pleocytosis, an elevated protein concentration, and normal glucose concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>). Documentation of primary HIV infection is accomplished by demonstration of seroconversion or detection of HIV-1 viremia in the absence of HIV antibody. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes simplex meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary HSV has been increasingly recognized as a cause of viral meningitis in adults. In contrast to HSV encephalitis, which is almost exclusively due to HSV-1, viral meningitis in immunocompetent adults is generally caused by HSV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Between 13 and 36 percent of patients presenting with primary genital herpes have clinical findings consistent with meningeal involvement, including headache, photophobia and meningismus. On the other hand, genital lesions are present in approximately 85 percent of patients with primary HSV-2 meningitis and generally precede the onset of CNS symptoms by approximately seven days. The CSF profile includes a pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes, and a normal CSF glucose concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>). HSV meningitis can also occur without evidence of genital lesions, although this is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Thus, the absence of genital lesions should not deter the clinician from testing for HSV-2 infection in a patient with aseptic meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pcr-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-in-patients-with-encephalitis-or-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PCR testing for the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus in patients with encephalitis or meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no standard approach to the treatment of HSV meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For hospitalized patients, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered every eight hours is reasonable. The dose should be adjusted for individuals with reduced kidney function, and recommendations are provided in the Lexicomp drug information topic within UpToDate. Patients can be switched to an oral agent on discharge for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment. </p><p>However, the role of antiviral therapy for HSV meningitis remains unclear, especially in immunocompetent hosts. As an example, a retrospective observational study that evaluated forty-two patient episodes of HSV meningitis found that immunocompromised patients had fewer neurologic sequelae when treated with a short course of antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, this benefit was not seen in the 27 patient episodes that occurred in immunocompetent patients. More studies are needed to help guide management decisions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent (Mollaret's) meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mollaret's meningitis is a form of recurrent benign lymphocytic meningitis (RBLM), an uncommon illness characterized by greater than three episodes of fever and meningismus lasting two to five days, followed by spontaneous resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is a large patient-to-patient variation in the time course to recurrence that can vary from weeks to years. One-half of patients can also exhibit transient neurological manifestations, including seizures, hallucinations, diplopia, cranial nerve palsies, or altered consciousness.</p><p>The most common etiologic agent in Mollaret's meningitis is HSV-2, although some patients do not have evidence of genital lesions at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies suggest that recurrent meningitis occurs in approximately 20 percent of patients who present with primary HSV-2 infection with meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The diagnosis can be made by PCR testing for HSV DNA in the CSF. </p><p>A randomized controlled trial evaluated whether suppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> (500 mg twice daily for one year) was more effective than placebo in preventing recurrent HSV-2-related recurrent meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Study participants had been diagnosed with meningitis related to primary HSV-2 infection or had a history of recurrent meningitis in the past. During the first year of follow-up, valacyclovir did not have an effect on the number of episodes of meningitis, although genital HSV-2 recurrences were lower in the treatment arm. However, during the second year, when patients were without study drug, the risk of recurrence of verified and probable HSV-2 meningitis was significantly higher among patients who had been exposed to valacyclovir. The trial was limited by several factors, including: inclusion of patients without a clear etiologic diagnosis at study entry, use of symptoms alone for the diagnosis of recurrent meningitis, and small sample size. </p><p>Noninfectious etiologies for Mollaret's meningitis have also been proposed. As an example, patients with an intracranial epidermoid cyst or other cystic abnormalities in the brain can develop meningeal irritation due to intermittent leakage of irritating squamous material into the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This may be detected acutely by polarizing microscopy of CSF. Imaging studies should be performed subsequently when the patient is asymptomatic, since the epidermoid cyst is often collapsed immediately after leaking its contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a human zoonosis caused by a rodent-borne arenavirus. LCMV is excreted in the urine and feces of rodents, including mice, rats, and hamsters, and is transmitted to humans by exposure to secretions or excretions (by direct contact or aerosol) of infected animals or contaminated environmental surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Infection is more common during winter months.</p><p>Affected patients generally present with an influenza-like systemic illness accompanied by headache and meningismus. A minority of patients develop orchitis, parotitis, myopericarditis, or arthritis.</p><p>CSF findings are typical of other causes of viral meningitis except that low glucose concentrations are observed in 20 to 30 percent of patients with LCMV meningitis and CSF WBC counts of greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> are not unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The diagnosis is established by documentation of seroconversion to the virus in paired serum samples; in addition, cell culture of CSF usually detects the presence of LCMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is no specific antiviral therapy for LCMV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mumps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aseptic meningitis is the most frequent extrasalivary complication of mumps virus infection. Prior to the introduction of the mumps vaccine in 1967, this paramyxovirus was a relatively common cause of viral meningitis, accounting for between 10 and 20 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>].</p><p>The most frequent manifestations are headache, low-grade fever, and mild nuchal rigidity. The onset of meningitis is variable and can occur before, during, or after an episode of mumps parotitis, although salivary gland enlargement is only present in about 50 percent of patients with mumps CNS disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mumps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mumps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CSF profile typically reveals fewer than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/microL</span> with a lymphocytic predominance, but more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/microL</span> and an early neutrophil predominance can occasionally be seen. The CSF total protein is generally normal or mildly elevated and the CSF glucose levels may be mildly depressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other viruses can infrequently be associated with viral meningitis. In certain areas of the United States, arthropod-borne viruses can cause aseptic meningitis. West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and California encephalitis group of viruses all can cause aseptic meningitis but more frequently are associated with encephalitis.

Specific serum treponemal tests are almost always positive. The CSF venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) has a generally accepted sensitivity of 30 to 70 percent, but is highly specific in the absence of visible blood contamination. A more detailed discussion of how to diagnose neurosyphilis is found elsewhere.

Patients who are elderly, immunocompromised, or have received antibiotics prior to presentation should be given antibiotics even if viral meningitis is the suspected diagnosis. Otherwise, the clinician can consider observing the patient without antibiotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When it is not clear whether the patient has a viral or bacterial process, the treating physician can choose empiric antibiotics after obtaining blood and CSF cultures or observation with repeat lumbar puncture (LP) in 6 to 24 hours. The majority of clinicians opt for empiric antibiotics until culture results are available in 24 to 48 hours. If the patient is symptomatically improved and culture results are negative, then antibiotics can generally be stopped without a repeat LP if the suspicion for bacterial meningitis is unlikely. However, repeat LP may be indicated in patients with persistent symptoms who do not have a clear diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Many patients fall into the indeterminate category because of the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms and signs and because each CSF finding taken in isolation often displays significant overlap among patients with viral and bacterial meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'CSF analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Examination of multiple parameters with the use of a nomogram may be helpful in deciding which patients should be treated empirically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the 2004 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on bacterial meningitis suggested that these prediction rules should not be used to make clinical decisions in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These guidelines can be accessed through the Infectious Diseases Society of America's website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aseptic-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Thus, in view of the serious consequences if treatment of bacterial meningitis is delayed, the threshold to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy pending the results of cultures should be relatively low. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with suspected viral meningitis or indeterminate CSF results, the CSF should be sent for virus detection assay (eg, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] for HSV and enteroviruses), as well as for bacterial culture and routine CSF studies. In patients with cutaneous clues as to the etiology (eg, genital herpes or herpes zoster), PCR testing is preferred. Other tests to consider in selected patients include: serum treponemal and nontreponemal tests and CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) tests, HIV <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> or RNA tests, Lyme serology, and <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/convalescent</span> serologic testing for specific viruses (LCMV, mumps, measles).

Evaluation should include a repeat CSF analysis with removal of large volume of fluid (3 to 5 mL, if possible) for fungal and mycobacterial cultures, and imaging of the CNS and sinuses with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT).
