These disorders impair oxidative phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], and were long regarded as neuromuscular diseases. However, they also cause dysfunction of the kidney and other organs because many tissues, in addition to muscle and brain, are highly dependent upon mitochondrial energy supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the mitochondrial cytopathies, with an emphasis on associated kidney disorders, is presented here. A brief review of the physiology and genetics of the mitochondria is required to fully understand the various clinical manifestations of the mitochondrial cytopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main function of the mitochondrion is the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and includes the oxidation of fuel molecules with energy transduction into ATP. During this process, reducing equivalents are transferred to oxygen via the complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-structure-function-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS DISORDERS WITH RENAL INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in both mitochondrial and nuclear genes have been identified in patients with mitochondrial disorder and renal involvement. However, the molecular definition of the genetic mutation underlying mitochondrial respiratory chain defects is complicated by the dual genetic control of respiratory chain proteins, and by the high number of genes involved in the biogenesis and the assembly of the respiratory chain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55067 \">table 1</a>). All modes of inheritance can be observed in mitochondrial disorders, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear gene mutations in sporadic cases; maternal transmission of mtDNA mutations; and autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked inheritance of nuclear gene mutations.</p><p>The genetics that underlie a mitochondrial disorder with renal involvement have been identified in only a few patients and families. These will be reviewed in the following sections. Disorders with primarily extrarenal manifestations due to mutations in mitochondrial genes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>mtDNA point mutations &minus; Point mutations in the <em>A3243G</em> mtDNA are associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Mutations of this gene result in impairment of mtDNA mitochondrial translation. <em>A3243G</em> mtDNA mutations have been detected in adults with diabetes mellitus and renal failure who subsequently develop characteristic signs of MELAS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

These deletions take away 2 to 10 kb of mtDNA and usually encompass several coding and transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. They are often sporadic and probably occur de novo during oogenesis or in early development. The size and the location of these deletions are not related either to the clinical symptoms or to the severity of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>mtDNA depletions &minus; Cases of lethal infantile respiratory, muscle, liver, or kidney failure have been ascribed to mtDNA depletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

As an example, mutations of the <em>BCS1</em> gene, which encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that chaperones the assembly of complex III of the respiratory chain, have been identified in patients from four families with a constellation of clinical findings: liver failure, lactic acidosis, hepatocellular insufficiency, tubulopathy, encephalopathy, deafness, and blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical expression of mitochondrial myopathies is extremely variable.

Symptoms usually begin during the neonatal period or before two years of age. Sodium and water wasting can result in polyuria (reaching 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day),</span> polydipsia, and episodes of vomiting, unexplained fever, and acute dehydration. Growth retardation and rickets are often noted at presentation, in part because of phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Isolated RTA may be observed in patients with mitochondrial disorders, including Kearns-Sayre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. These patients may also have hypercalciuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In one case report, hypoparathyroidism and severe hypomagnesemia secondary to tubular dysfunction were observed in a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients with mitochondrial disorder may also present with signs of salt depletion and with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis similar to findings seen in Bartter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-involvement-in-the-mitochondrial-cytopathies/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Extrarenal symptoms are present in all such patients.</p><p>Tubular losses are often mild with no clinical manifestations.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics disorders with renal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal involvement with clinical symptoms is observed in 5 percent of patients with mitochondrial disorders. The most common renal manifestation is the de Toni-Debr&eacute;-Fanconi syndrome with impaired proximal tubular function that may lead to glucosuria, tubular proteinuria (including generalized amino aciduria), renal tubular acidosis (RTA), hypokalemia, and hypouricemia. Other less common renal manifestations include steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Renal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome and <em>A3243G</em> mtDNA mutation, renal symptoms occur in early adulthood and are the initial presentation in one-third of cases. These patients are also at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hearing loss. Most patients will progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at a median age of 33 years. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of the primary mitochondrial disorders can be challenging because of the dual genomic origins (nuclear and mitochondrial), multisystem manifestations, and broad phenotypic heterogeneity encompassed by these conditions. The diagnosis is made based upon clinical findings and laboratory evaluation that includes measurement of the plasma levels of lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies, histologic and biochemical testing on tissue samples, and DNA analyses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no satisfactory treatment at present for mitochondrial cytopathies. Patients should avoid drugs (eg, valproic acid, barbiturates, tetracyclines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloramphenicol</a>) or activities that interfere with or strain respiratory chain function. Some therapeutic agents or interventions may be effective in specific disorders, such as oral CoQ10 supplementation in patients with defects in CoQ10 biosynthesis.
