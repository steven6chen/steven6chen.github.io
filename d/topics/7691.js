The fibrils are insoluble polymers comprised of these low molecular weight subunit proteins. These subunits are derived, in turn, from soluble precursors, which undergo conformational changes that lead to the adoption of a predominantly antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Amyloid deposits appear as amorphous hyaline material on light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63840%7ENEPH%2F78183%7ENEPH%2F54148%7ENEPH%2F75254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63840 graphicRef78183 graphicRef54148 graphicRef75254 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The fibrils bind Congo red (leading to green birefringence under polarized light) and thioflavine T (producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence). Electron microscopic examination of the ultrastructure of amyloid deposits generally demonstrates straight and unbranching fibrils, which may be composed of protofilaments at higher resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Immunohistochemical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and biochemical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] techniques can be used to identify the type of protein subunit.</p><p>Routes to fibrillogenesis include partial folding or unfolding of the precursor protein that may be facilitated by acidification or proteolysis and that may be accelerated by nucleation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Fibril formation is also associated with co-deposition of other substances, notably including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate), serum amyloid P-component (SAP, a member of the pentraxin family that includes C-reactive protein), and specific apolipoproteins (E and J) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Cofactors, including molecular chaperones and proteases, may significantly modulate fibrillogenesis at any of several steps involved in the conversion of soluble precursors to fibrils and may potentially influence the deposition phase of amyloid in tissue, as well as resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>The importance of heredity in the expression of amyloid diseases has been recognized for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some amyloid disorders appear to be entirely due to heritable abnormalities in precursor proteins. In addition, the expression of acquired amyloidoses may be affected by genetically determined factors.</p><p>The genetic contributions to various types of amyloidosis will be reviewed here. Three types of genetic abnormalities have been identified in amyloidogenic proteins: polymorphisms, variant molecules (eg, due to missense mutations, deletions, or premature stop codons), and genetically determined posttranslational modifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F97157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97157 \">table 1</a>). In addition, mutations in genes for non-amyloidogenic proteins can play a permissive role in amyloid development. Examples include pyrin mutations in familial Mediterranean fever and presenilin mutations in early-onset Alzheimer disease.</p><p>An overview of the amyloidoses and the genetics of Alzheimer disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC AMYLOIDOSES REFLECTED IN SUBUNIT PROTEIN MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the familial diseases associated with missense mutations, the point mutation that correlates with clinical disease usually occurs in the part of the precursor molecule that actually forms the fibril subunit protein; other precursor domains may be eliminated by metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] or may be digested away prior to or after fibril formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Amino acid substitutions resulting from missense mutations may be found in subunit protein subsequences that adopt a fibrillar configuration in vitro. This has been demonstrated by examining the fibrillogenic potential of recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides corresponding to these sub-sequences. In some instances, the mutant is intrinsically more fibrillogenic in vitro than the wild-type peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations that have been associated with early-onset or familial cases of Alzheimer disease (AD) also include substitutions that occur contiguous to, but not within, the amyloidogenic Alzheimer beta protein (A-beta) sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. In these cases, it is assumed that diversion of APP processing to an amyloid-producing pathway is the primary mechanism leading to accumulation of fibrillogenic A-beta peptides at the sites of pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In two forms of hereditary amyloid disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(British/Danish</span> dementia and apolipoprotein A-II nephropathy), mutations at the site of stop codons lead to carboxyterminal extensions that are not expressed by the wild-type protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/1,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24,25</a>]. Fibril subunit protein may include an amino-terminal portion of the precursor (eg, apolipoprotein A1), a carboxyterminal fragment (eg, fibrinogen A-alpha chain), or the entire molecule (eg. transthyretin).</p><p>Mutant forms of amyloidogenic proteins can be defined serologically or by <span class=\"nowrap\">immunoblot/immunoelectrophoresis,</span> looking for abnormal precursors or metabolic products in blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Genetic testing for the single base substitution characteristic for the particular amyloid disease is usually carried out by directly sequencing the amplified exon of the relevant gene of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A resource for the tabulation of mutations associated with the systemic hereditary amyloidoses is <a href=\"http://www.amyloidosismutations.com/&amp;token=Xvu/kzgsFMm73D9ms8MT+R8nQvKMpun55/gV4o1vDkdQpqiFFMDQUkQoV73MKTWi&amp;TOPIC_ID=5590\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.amyloidosismutations.com</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transthyretin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transthyretin (TTR or prealbumin) gene is located on chromosome 18, and more than 130 TTR mutations have been described, including single mutations, compound heterozygotes, and deletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nearly all mutant TTR gene products are amyloidogenic. Mutations have been identified in approximately 40 percent of the amino acids of this 127 residue single chain molecule. Twenty-two residues have more than one substitution associated with disease; these tend to occur at mutational hot spots in the DNA sequence and along portions of the molecule known to adopt a beta-pleated sheet configuration from radiograph crystallography of wild-type TTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Different variants of the TTR gene present predominantly as neuropathic, cardiomyopathic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ocular (vitreous) disease, which may be familial or sporadic. One registry-based study in Swedish patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) has suggested that such patients may be at increased risk for the development of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Certain populations have an increased prevalence of particular mutations. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic areas of Portugal, 1 of every 600 people carries a TTR gene that leads to a methionine substitution for valine at position 30 and that may result in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The same mutation is seen in some other countries such as Sweden and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In northern Sweden, the carrier frequency is 8.3-fold higher than in Portugal, but with a lower incidence and prevalence due to a much lower penetrance (5 versus 87 percent) before age 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Although haplotype analysis of contiguous TTR gene regions in Swedish, French, Portuguese, and Japanese carriers indicates common founders, these phenotypic differences suggest the importance of additional genetic and epigenetic factors in disease expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. National FAP registers from Japan, France, and Italy, as well as the TTR Amyloidosis Outcome Survey (THAOS), have provided additional evidence for genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity for both hereditary and wild-type amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated cardiac amyloidosis presenting virtually exclusively as late-onset (age &gt;65) disease is more common in African Americans than Caucasians, and 3 to 4 percent of African Americans and Afro-Caribbean individuals are carriers for an amyloidogenic substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 122 (V122I).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetic amyloidoses reflected in subunit protein mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features, age at onset, and progression of disease may be uniform among members of the same kindred carrying specific amyloidogenic mutations. However, a uniform course is not universal. Rarely, individuals with an amyloidogenic mutation (homozygous or heterozygous) may remain relatively asymptomatic, may have late-onset disease, or may have more severe disease. Variations in clinical manifestations between different kindreds carrying the same mutations suggest an important role for modifier genes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possibly environmental factors in disease expression. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Variable penetrance and late-onset hereditary amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of secondary (AA) amyloid complicating disorders such as leprosy, juvenile and adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and tuberculosis varies considerably between populations. Additional studies are necessary to reconcile these observations and to establish the significance of SAA polymorphisms as predictive risk factors for the development of AA amyloid. (See <a href=\"#H5026739\" class=\"local\">'Genetic determinants of AA amyloidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AA amyloid complicates four hereditary diseases with varying frequencies: familial Mediterranean fever; the TRAPS syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and, rarely, hyperimmunoglobulinemia IgD syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'AA amyloid and the heredofamilial amyloidoses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous mutations have been found to affect the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein gene and the presenilin genes, which play a role in Alzheimer disease. The genetics of Alzheimer disease are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloidosis of the eye or skin may be an organ-specific manifestation of a systemic disease may be or localized to these organs.
