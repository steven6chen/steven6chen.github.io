Ten types of HPS associated with mutations in 10 different genes have been recognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115599 \">table 1</a>). These mutations each cause altered biogenesis of lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles and defective intracellular protein trafficking.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of HPS. Oculocutaneous albinism and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, another type of syndromic oculocutaneous albinism associated with severe immunodeficiency, are discussed separately.

As an example, the prevalence is 1 in 1800 individuals in the northwestern region of Puerto Rico, where approximately 1 in 22 individuals are carriers of the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most HPS type 1-affected individuals in Puerto Rico have the same founder 16-base-pair duplication in exon 15 of <em>HPS1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2034377728\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is caused by mutations in 1 of 10 genes encoding protein components of four protein complexes (adapter protein 3 [AP-3] and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex [BLOC-1, BLOC-2, BLOC-3]) involved in intracellular biogenesis and trafficking of lysosome and lysosome-related organelles (LROS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115599 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. LROS include melanosomes, platelet dense bodies (also called delta granules), lamellar bodies of type II pneumocytes, and granule proteins of cytotoxic and suppressor T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>The hypopigmentation in HPS is secondary to impaired melanosome formation, trafficking, or transfer to keratinocytes, while the melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes is unaffected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, oculocutaneous albinism is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oculocutaneous-albinism#H1738977410\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oculocutaneous albinism&quot;, section on 'Defective melanin biosynthesis'</a>.)</p><p>The platelet dense bodies, which play a role in secondary platelet aggregation, are completely absent in platelets from individuals with HPS, resulting in a platelet storage pool disorder and bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The number of platelet dense bodies is also severely reduced in Chediak-Higashi syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71313 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Inherited disorders of platelet function'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of the organ damage associated with some types of HPS is unclear. Ceroid lipofuscin, an amorphous, autofluorescent, lipid-protein material, has been identified in the lysosomes of multiple organs (including renal tubular cells, alveolar macrophages, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and heart) in patients with HPS, but their role in the clinical manifestations of HPS (ie, pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, immunodeficiency) remains largely unknown. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1405879220\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), melanosomes are immature and impaired, causing reduced pigment of hair, skin, and eyes. The absence of platelet dense bodies can only be identified by whole mount electron microscopy.</p><p>Abnormal lysosomes cause immunodeficiency in HPS type 2. Abnormal lysosomes accumulate ceroid lipofuscin, which is thought to cause granulomatous colitis (HPS type 1) and lung interstitial fibrosis in HPS types 1, 2, and 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome'</a>).

Other clinical manifestations, such as granulomatous colitis and pulmonary fibrosis, occur in specific types depending on the specific genetic defect. Of note, individuals with mutations affecting the same HPS protein complex (adapter protein 3 [AP-3] and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex [BLOC-1, BLOC-2, or BLOC-3]) present similar clinical characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115599 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2034377728\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p>HPS types 1 and 4 are the most severe forms of the disorder and the only types associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Types 3, 5, and 6 are associated with a milder phenotype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119271897\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and eye findings</span></p><p>Patients with HPS present with decreased pigmentation of the skin and hair. The skin color is variable, ranging from white to tan, but usually lighter than that of other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Individuals with HPS have an increased risk of skin cancer, in particular, squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma.</p><p>The eyes show reduced iris pigmentation and vary in color from light blue, light green, or hazel. In patients with HPS, the ocular abnormalities are similar to those seen in patients with oculocutaneous albinism and include early nystagmus, ocular sensitivity to bright light, iris transillumination, reduced retinal pigmentation, and reduced visual acuity for age, although their severity is widely variable among specific types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The severity of bleeding varies considerably across HPS types and may be unnoticed in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Routine coagulation studies show a prolonged bleeding time, normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and normal platelet count and morphology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3995114366\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary fibrosis similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs only in patients with HPS types 1, 2, and 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115599 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. The disease is characterized by irreversible and progressive fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and interalveolar septa. The manifestations usually begin in the early 30s with a gradual onset of dyspnea on exertion and a nonproductive cough, ultimately leading to respiratory failure.

One approach involves the use of a multigene panel containing the 10 recognized genes associated with HPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].&nbsp;An alternative approach is step-wise, single-gene testing guided by consideration of clinical features and ethnic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hermansky-pudlak-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, testing for <em>HPS1</em>&nbsp;pathogenic variants should be performed first in persons from northwest Puerto Rico, while the <em>HPS3</em> founder variant should be investigated in those of central Puerto Rican or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. <em>HPS1</em> and <em>HPS4</em> should be examined first in those who are severely affected or present with symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2954897922\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) types associated with a mild phenotype presenting with a minimal or unrecognized bleeding tendency may be misdiagnosed with oculocutaneous albinism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oculocutaneous-albinism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oculocutaneous albinism&quot;</a>).

Pulmonary fibrosis similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis occurs only in patients with HPS types 1, 2, and 4. A granulomatous colitis resembling Crohn disease clinically and histologically occurs in patients with HPS types 1 and 4. Severe neutropenia and immunodeficiency have been reported in individuals with HPS type 2. Individuals with HPS also have an increased risk of skin cancer, in particular, squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1970705341\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HPS is suspected in a patient with skin and hair color lighter than that of other family members, early-onset nystagmus, and a history of easy bruising starting in infancy, epistaxis or gingival bleeding, or excessive bleeding after minor surgical procedures. The demonstration of absent dense bodies on electron microscopy of platelets using the &quot;whole mount&quot; technique (available in specialized referral laboratories) establishes the diagnosis of HPS. Genetic testing, if available, can confirm the diagnosis and determine the HPS type. (See <a href=\"#H3511553140\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with HPS involves lifelong sun protection measures, regular skin examination at 6- to 12-month intervals starting in adolescence for early detection and treatment of skin cancer, treatment of visual impairment, and treatment of associated systemic manifestations. Granulomatous colitis is treated with systemic corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents used for the treatment of Crohn disease. Patients with HPS who develop pulmonary fibrosis may eventually require lung transplantation.
