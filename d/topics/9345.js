The preferred venous access site during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the largest, most accessible vein that does not require the interruption of resuscitation. Peripheral venous access is attempted before attempting other forms of vascular access if peripheral veins can be readily seen or palpated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-venous-access-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral venous access in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraosseous (IO) infusion, a technique for vascular access, was described first in 1922 and was widely used for drug administration in children in the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. It fell out of favor during the 1950s and 1960s, when disposable intravenous catheters were developed and techniques for insertion improved. In the 1980s, after the publication of numerous clinical reports of its effective use in children and animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>], the practice of IO infusion increased. Use in adults has also grown, especially in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Today, the procedure is reserved for acute, life-threatening or medically necessary situations when standard venous access methods cannot be rapidly achieved and as the first attempt at vascular access in cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock in selected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6338267\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraosseous (IO) infusion is possible because of the presence of veins that drain the medullary sinuses in the bone marrow of long bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77643\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77643 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These veins, supported by the bony matrix, do not collapse in patients with shock or hypovolemia. The following list provides the site and draining vessels for the most commonly used sites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal tibia &ndash; Popliteal vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femur &ndash; Branches of the femoral vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal tibia (medial malleolus) &ndash; Great saphenous vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal humerus &ndash; Axillary vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manubrium (upper sternum) &ndash; Internal mammary and azygos veins</p><p/><p>The anterior inferior iliac spine, clavicle, and distal radius have also been used successfully for IO vascular access as have bones without medullary cavities, including the calcaneous and radial styloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240422519\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraosseous (IO) cannulation is likely to be used by the emergency care provider during resuscitation. The patient&rsquo;s life may well depend upon the clinician&rsquo;s ability to secure vascular access. Thus, emergency physicians and others who may need to perform IO cannulation emergently should learn to do so well in advance of the immediate need.</p><p>Training can take place on simulation models, animal bones (eg, chicken or turkey legs), or a cadaver. IO placement is taught as part of the Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Advanced Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and Advanced Trauma Life Support Courses. After training, typically consisting of a one-hour lecture followed by a one-hour hands-on experience, novice users have achieved success rates of 93 to 97 percent for manual and battery-powered IO placement in a variety of simulated settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p>High success rates with battery-powered IO placement have also been shown in field and hospital care after such training:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paramedics achieved an 87 percent success rate for field IO placement in infants under two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Military medics achieved a 97 percent success rate for IO cannulation in children and adults during combat situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physicians achieved a 94 percent success rate for IO placement in 95 children treated in an emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that infants and children in cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock who do not have readily available intravenous access undergo intraosseous (IO) cannulation rather than central venous line placement or surgical venous cutdown.</p><p>We suggest that adults in cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock who do not have readily available intravenous access also undergo IO cannulation rather than central venous line placement or surgical venous cutdown.</p><p>IO cannulation may also be appropriate in emergent or urgent situations where reliable venous access cannot be achieved quickly (eg, patients with shock, sepsis, status epilepticus, extensive burns, multiple trauma) or in patients for whom intravascular access is medically necessary and cannot be achieved by other means despite multiple attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In awake patients, analgesia is warranted prior to infusion if the patient&rsquo;s condition permits. (See <a href=\"#H1240422429\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia'</a> below.)</p><p>IO cannulation permits intravascular access through which diagnostic studies may be obtained, fluid resuscitation may occur, and a wide variety of medications can be rapidly delivered.

IO cannulation permits rapid intravascular access in critically ill children and adults as demonstrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a trial comparing success rates and time to insertion between IO and peripheral IV access among children requiring fluid resuscitation for severe dehydration in a hospital setting, the IO route was successful within five minutes for 100 percent of patients, as compared with 67 percent success within five minutes for peripheral IV placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a retrospective series describing attempts by paramedics to establish peripheral IV access for 300 children (0 to 18 years) in the prehospital setting, IV access was successful in two-thirds of all children and in only 49 percent of a subset of children younger than six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an observational series describing the use of IO cannulation in patients of all ages in the prehospital setting, the overall success rate was 76 percent, with 85 percent success in children between one and two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IO vascular access was achieved in less than one minute for 85 percent of cases in a prospective report evaluating the time to insertion and success rate of IO cannulation in a variety of prehospital settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a trial of 182 adults receiving vascular access for cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting, tibial IO placement was associated with a significantly higher frequency of initial vascular access success than peripheral IV placement (91 versus 43 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although initial success with humeral IO access was higher than for peripheral IV access (71 versus 49 percent), overall success was not significantly different because of a high rate of IO catheter displacement among patients with humeral IO cannulas. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Sites of placement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A trial of IO needle placement using a battery-powered driver or spring-loaded device in 40 adults receiving prehospital care found that vascular access was successfully achieved on the first attempt in 80 to 90 percent of patients, and within two minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A prospective observational study compared IO cannulation using a battery-operated driver device (EZIO) with internal jugular or subclavian central venous access in 10 adult patients, all of whom received both procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraosseous-infusion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. IO access was achieved on the first attempt more frequently (90 versus 60 percent) and took significantly less time (2 versus 10 minutes) than central venous access.</p><p/><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that establishing peripheral IV access often is delayed or unsuccessful during resuscitation of critically ill patients, particularly small children. Furthermore, alternative methods of vascular access such as central venous access by percutaneous or surgical venous cutdown takes much longer and are less likely to be successful than IO placement. Finally, all drugs and fluids that might be delivered through peripheral or central venous lines can also be administered through an IO cannula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;, section on 'Central access'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;, section on 'Venous cutdown'</a> and <a href=\"#H17935746\" class=\"local\">'Fluid and drug administration'</a> below.)</p><p>In adults, difficult or failed peripheral vascular access is also problematic, especially in the prehospital setting. Alternative approaches to IO cannulation such as ultrasound-guided peripheral IV access and central venous access also achieve high success rates but take longer to perform than IO access.

These veins, supported by the bony matrix, do not collapse in patients with shock or hypovolemia. (See <a href=\"#H6338267\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that infants and children in cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock who do not have readily available intravenous access undergo IO cannulation for medication administration, fluid therapy, and diagnostic studies rather than percutaneous central venous line placement or surgical venous cutdown (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that adults in cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock who do not have readily available intravenous access undergo IO cannulation for medication administration, fluid therapy, and diagnostic studies rather than percutaneous central venous line placement or surgical venous cutdown (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We emphasize that an IO needle be flushed before and after medication administration if fluids are not already infusing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IO cannulation may also be appropriate in patients with emergent or urgent conditions where reliable venous access cannot be achieved quickly (eg, shock, sepsis, status epilepticus, extensive burns, multiple trauma) or in patients for whom intravascular access is medically necessary and cannot be achieved by other means.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IO cannulation should not be performed in fractured bones, bones with a prior failed IO placement attempt, or in extremities with vascular disruption. IO access also should be avoided in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, osteopetrosis, right to left congenital cardiac shunts, or those with burns or infection near the access site. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients who undergo IO placement for life-threatening illnesses (eg, cardiac arrest) have the first attempt made at the proximal tibial site, unless otherwise contraindicated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Preferred alternative sites vary based upon the age and skeletal maturity of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53119 \">table 1</a>). A battery-powered or impact driven device is typically required to accomplish IO placement in the proximal tibia of patients over six years of age.

These patients may receive systemic analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> intraosseously) or infusion of preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, if they become responsive to pain once the IO is placed and as tolerated by their clinical condition.
