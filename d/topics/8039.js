However, some women lose a lot more blood. This is referred to as heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, and has also been called menorrhagia. Most women have a menstrual period every 24 to 38 days (that is, the time from the first day of one menstrual period to the onset of the next); the average is every 28 days.</p><p>Women who lose 5 to 6 tablespoons (about 80 milliliters) of blood or more during their menstrual period are said to have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding. Losing a lot of blood during the menstrual period can cause medical problems such as anemia (low red blood cell count).</p><p>There are several treatments for heavy bleeding. More detailed information about heavy menstrual bleeding is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of excessive menstrual bleeding are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not ovulating once per month (called anovulation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having abnormal tissue in the uterus, such as polyps, fibroids, or adenomyosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a condition that increases bleeding throughout the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anovulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anovulation occurs when your ovaries do not produce and release an egg (ovulate) once per month. This causes your menstrual period to be irregular or absent. Anovulation is common in adolescents and in women who are near menopause. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often do not ovulate regularly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal tissue in the uterus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncancerous growths in the uterus can cause heavy menstrual bleeding.

Bleeding this heavily can be serious or even life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have heavy menstrual bleeding, your healthcare provider will want to perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. The healthcare provider might recommend other tests, based on what he or she finds during the exam. This can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to look for anemia, thyroid disease, or a bleeding disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pelvic ultrasound (usually performed through the vagina), which uses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus and ovaries. An ultrasound can detect endometrial polyps and fibroids. A specialized pelvic ultrasound called sonohysterogram or saline infusion sonogram involves placing a small flexible tube through the vagina into the uterus to infuse a small amount of sterile water into the cavity of the uterus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy of the tissue inside of the uterus, called an endometrial biopsy. This can be done in the office.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hysteroscopy, which uses a small telescope to look inside the uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of your bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your preferences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you need to prevent pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your desire to have children in the future</p><p/><p>Your healthcare provider will probably recommend treatment with one or more medicines first. If these treatments do not reduce bleeding enough, a surgical treatment might be an option (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal birth control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal methods of birth control which may be used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding include the pill, skin patch, vaginal ring, shot, and hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). These treatments reduce bleeding during your menstrual period. Hormonal birth control can also reduce cramps and pain during your period. It might take three months for bleeding to improve after you start taking hormonal birth control.</p><p>Some forms of hormonal birth control, including the pill, skin patch, and vaginal ring, are designed to be used for three weeks in a row, followed by one week off. During the fourth week, you will have bleeding.</p><p>More information about hormonal birth control is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some doctors and nurses advise women with heavy menstrual periods to take hormonal birth control continuously, without a break week. If you take this approach, you will not have monthly menstrual cycles. This strategy is called continuous dosing.</p><p>Several brands of birth control pills are packaged with 3 months of pills to make it easier to take the pill continuously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60354 \">table 1</a>). You can also take other types of hormonal birth control continuously. This is explained in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics#H15\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Continuous dosing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal intrauterine device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an IUD that slowly releases a hormone, progestin, into the uterus. There is no estrogen in the IUD. This device is called Mirena or Liletta in the United States and in other countries. The IUD prevents pregnancy and reduces menstrual bleeding for up to five years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74378\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74378 \">picture 1</a>). A healthcare provider places the IUD inside the uterus. This treatment is best for women who do not want to become pregnant in the next six months. The most common side effect of the hormonal IUD is irregular bleeding; this is usually light bleeding or spotting. This usually improves after the first several months after IUD placement. In women who use a hormonal IUD specifically to treat heavy bleeding, expulsion rates (when the uterus pushes the IUD into an improper position or completely out of the uterus) are high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics#H3\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine device (IUD)'</a>.). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Shot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (brand name: Depo-Provera) is a long-acting form of a progesterone-like hormone, called a progestin. It is a shot given once every three months. This treatment prevents pregnancy and can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. The shot is best for women who do not want to become pregnant in the next year or longer.</p><p>The most common side effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate is bleeding and spotting, particularly during the first few months. Many women completely stop having menstrual periods after using this treatment for one year. More detailed information about medroxyprogesterone acetate is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics#H19\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Injectable birth control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifibrinolytic medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antifibrinolytic medicines can help to slow menstrual bleeding quickly. These medicines work by helping the blood clotting system. Examples include tranexamic acid (brand name: Lysteda).</p><p>The advantages of antifibrinolytic medicines over other medical treatments are that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medicine slows bleeding quickly (within two to three hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You need to take the medicine only a few days each month</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medicines do not affect your chances of becoming pregnant</p><p/><p>Side effects can include headache and muscle cramps or pain. You should not take antifibrinolytic medicines with hormonal birth control unless your healthcare provider approves; there is controversy regarding a possible increased risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack when taken together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (brand name: Motrin and Advil) and mefenamic acid (brand name: Ponstel), can help reduce menstrual bleeding and menstrual cramps. You can buy some NSAIDs (including ibuprofen) without a prescription.</p><p>NSAIDs are not expensive, have few side effects, and reduce pain and bleeding, and you need to take them only during your menstrual period. You can take NSAIDs in combination with any of the medical treatments discussed here. However, NSAIDs do not reduce bleeding as well other medical treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestin pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Norethindrone acetate or medroxyprogesterone in pill form (brand name: Provera) can also be taken as a pill. Progestin pills are sometimes recommended for women who do not ovulate regularly. They may be prescribed for 5 to 14 days each month, or continuously (every day). &#160;</p><p>This treatment helps to prevent the lining of the uterus from becoming thickened, which can cause excessive bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GnRH agonists are a type of medicine that can be used to temporarily reduce menstrual bleeding. This treatment might be recommended for women who are waiting to have a surgical treatment.</p><p>These medicines work by &quot;turning off&quot; the ovaries, causing a temporary menopause. The medicines can be taken for up to six months. Side effects may include hot flashes and vaginal dryness as might otherwise be experienced by a menopausal woman. GnRH agonists are not usually recommended for longer than six months in a row due to the risk of weakened bones when used for long periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY FOR HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have growths in the uterus, such as polyps or fibroids, having a treatment to remove the growth can reduce or end heavy bleeding.</p><p>Fibroids can be treated by removing them (called myomectomy) or cutting off their blood supply (called uterine artery embolization). These procedures are discussed in depth in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other surgical treatments for menorrhagia include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial ablation is a treatment that destroys or removes most of the lining of the uterus. This can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding or cause you to stop having menstrual bleeding. It is not a good option for women who might want to become pregnant in the future and may not be appropriate for women whose abnormal bleeding is caused by anovulation. The cause of the bleeding should be identified before endometrial ablation is performed.</p><p>The treatment can be done in the office or as a day surgery. After the treatment, most women have some cramping, vaginal discharge, and nausea. You may have a pinkish vaginal discharge for two to three days afterward; this gradually becomes clear and watery and can last for 2 to 10 days. Most women can go back to work or school the following day.

This is a permanent treatment that cures heavy menstrual bleeding. However, the surgery can have complications and may require up to six weeks for full recovery. Pregnancy is not possible after hysterectomy. More detailed information about hysterectomy is available separately.
