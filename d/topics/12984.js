The paradigm for ensuring the safety of the blood supply using donor screening and laboratory testing is limited because it requires prior knowledge of the possible infectious agents, development of effective laboratory tests for each agent, and widespread application of that testing to all collected blood. For this reason, it has been a long-sought goal to find an effective way to sterilize blood after collection using a pathogen inactivation technology.</p><p>This topic review discusses available methods for pathogen inactivation of blood products including plasma, platelets, red blood cells, and plasma derivatives, and it provides evidence for the effectiveness and potential limitations of these procedures.</p><p>Approaches to reducing infectious risk using blood donor screening and blood product testing to eliminate products at risk of carrying infectious organisms are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3378191109\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PATHOGEN INACTIVATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3360063004\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms pathogen inactivation and pathogen reduction have been used interchangeably by some authors. Strictly speaking, pathogen inactivation refers to complete prevention of infectivity by a pathogen, whereas pathogen reduction refers to decreasing the amount of an infectious pathogen, either by physical removal (eg, nanofiltration) or by an inactivation technology. Some experts have proposed that the term &quot;pathogen inactivation&quot; be used to refer to the processing of the component, and &quot;pathogen-reduced blood component&quot; be used to refer to the transfusable product because no method can guarantee complete sterility of the component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445426785\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential benefits</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3159643278\"><span class=\"h3\">Reducing or eliminating infectious organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In principle, pathogen inactivation technologies have the potential to make the blood supply safer by broadly reducing or eliminating infectious organisms without the need to screen or test for specific pathogens. This is especially appealing for pathogens that cause asymptomatic infection (and thus would not be identified by donor screening), those with a long window period during which serologic testing would be ineffective, and emerging infectious diseases such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, <em>Babesia</em>, and as yet unknown emerging pathogens for which donated blood is not screened.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malaria</strong> &ndash; The benefit of pathogen inactivation in reducing transfusion-transmitted malaria was demonstrated in a trial conducted in Ghana, where malaria is endemic and testing of donated blood for malaria is not routinely available. In this trial, 226 adults who required blood transfusion were randomly assigned to receive whole blood that had been treated with riboflavin plus UV light (see <a href=\"#H1967784046\" class=\"local\">'Riboflavin+UV light'</a> below) or whole blood that had not been treated with pathogen inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately one-fourth of the units of blood had detectable parasitemia. Transfusion-transmitted malaria was distinguished from other routes of infection (eg, de novo infection, reactivation) using comparison of parasite DNA sequence by PCR. The rate of transfusion-transmitted malaria was significantly lower with the riboflavin plus UV-treated units (1 of 28 versus 8 of 37 [4 versus 22 percent, respectively]). The increase in hemoglobin and the incidence of adverse events were similar between the two arms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Zika</strong> &ndash; The use of pathogen inactivation in reducing transfusion-transmitted Zika virus infection has been tested in in vitro studies in which Zika virus was added to platelet or plasma components that were then treated with amotosalen and UVA light (see <a href=\"#H3136810037\" class=\"local\">'Amotosalen+UVA light'</a> below), followed by testing for titer and infectivity using PCR-based assays and viral culture, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These assays demonstrated no Zika infectivity or replicative virus following the PI treatment of plasma or platelets. Similar inactivation has been reported for other common arborviruses including West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and dengue virus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3911091309\"><span class=\"h3\">Other potential benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathogen inactivation of platelets also has the potential to extend the shelf-life of each platelet unit, which is short (five days in most countries) due to the need for room temperature storage and the associated risk of bacterial infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H382870457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Platelet storage and pathogen reduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another potential benefit of the pathogen inactivation technologies that damage nucleic acids is their role in reducing the need to irradiate products to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD), a life-threatening complication of transfusion in which donor white blood cells attack the bone marrow and other tissues of the transfusion recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2042469410\" class=\"local\">'Methods that damage nucleic acids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838429159\"><span class=\"h2\">Technologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various technologies have been studied for pathogen inactivation. Early studies focused on developing methods that could be applied to transfusable plasma such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), which is especially amenable to inactivation treatments because it does not contain cells that might be destroyed or become functionally impaired by an inactivation procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The two major approaches involve the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methods that inactivate lipids and thus target a large number of pathogenic lipid-enveloped viruses <span class=\"nowrap\">(solvent/detergent</span> treatment).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methods that damage nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) and prevent normal replication of a wide array of microorganisms. Examples include adding amotosalen or riboflavin to the blood component, both of which are then activated using ultraviolet (UV) light, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene Blue</a>, activated using visible light.</p><p/><p>Multiple steps in the fractionation and purification processes used to manufacture plasma derivatives also remove <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> destroy infectious agents. These include heat pasteurization (treatment at 60&deg;C for 10 hours), which was used in the manufacture of serum albumin and shown to kill hepatitis B virus (at the time called &quot;serum hepatitis virus&quot;), as well as &quot;wet&quot; pasteurization and chromatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491276952\"><span class=\"h3\">Methods that damage lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods that damage the lipid envelopes of viruses may target a broad range of viruses; however, these methods do not target non-enveloped viruses. Methods that inactivate lipid enveloped viruses have been available since the mid-1980s.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526608893\"><span class=\"h4\">Solvent/detergent treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment was first applied to the manufacture of plasma derivatives and subsequently has been adapted for the production of transfusable plasma units such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). The process involves pooling large numbers of individual units together prior to applying the <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment. It uses the properties of organic solvents (eg, tri-n-butyl-phosphate) and nonionic detergents such as triton X-100 to disrupt lipid-based membranes. This is highly effective in inactivating viruses with lipid envelopes, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment does not inactivate non-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and parvovirus B19, but other plasma units in the pool are likely to contain antibodies to these viruses that may reduce the pathogenicity of the component to the recipient. With a few exceptions, <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment does not affect the structure or function of plasma proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2042469410\"><span class=\"h3\">Methods that damage nucleic acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods that damage nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) are especially appealing because almost all pathogens (with the exception of prions) require nucleic acids to reproduce and to cause clinically significant infection, whereas red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets lack nuclei and do not require functional nucleic acids. These methods target all nucleic acids (regardless of the specific nucleotide sequence) and as a result are able to inactivate viruses (enveloped and some non-enveloped), bacteria, and parasites that use nucleic acids to replicate. The relative resistance of some non-enveloped viruses to inactivation is thought to be due to the inability of the added chemical to fully penetrate the viral capsid.</p><p>Inactivation of nucleic acids in lymphocytes present in the blood product is a potential benefit because this renders the transfused lymphocytes incapable of mounting an immune reaction against the host and in turn is effective in preventing transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. If universal pathogen inactivation was instituted for all components, this would eliminate the need for irradiation to prevent ta-GVHD as well as the need for CMV testing to maintain CMV-negative inventories. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H445426785\" class=\"local\">'Potential benefits'</a> above.)</p><p>These methods do not eliminate the need for leukoreduction, because inactivated white blood cells may still leak cytokines that can cause febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3136810037\"><span class=\"h4\">Amotosalen+UVA light</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The psoralen compound amotosalen (previously called S-59) intercalates into DNA and RNA and can be photoactivated by long wavelength UV light (UVA) to crosslink the base pairs together, preventing replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Activity of plasma proteins and coagulation factors is not adversely affected by this treatment, and significant adverse effects have not been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Amotosalen is removed from the blood product after treatment, before the blood product is transfused, to provide further protection against adverse reactions or toxicity in the recipient. This method is used in the INTERCEPT systems, which are available for pathogen reduced plasma and platelets. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Plasma/FFP'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1967784046\"><span class=\"h4\">Riboflavin+UV light</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A portion of the riboflavin (vitamin B2) molecule binds to nucleic acids and UV light activation can oxidize the guanine nucleotide (G) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In this case the UV is mostly UVB but also uses light in the UVA and UVC spectrum. Riboflavin is a water soluble vitamin that has a well-characterized safety profile (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-water-soluble-vitamins#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of water-soluble vitamins&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)'</a>). This method is used in the Mirasol systems, which are used for pathogen inactivation of plasma and platelets. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Plasma/FFP'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3236042519\"><span class=\"h4\">Methylene blue+visible light</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MB treatment, coupled with visible (white or red) light treatment, has been used in Europe to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses including HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV, EBV, and CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Certain arboviruses such as chikungunya and dengue are also inactivated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, this system works only with products that have been leukocyte depleted prior to MB treatment as it appears that MB cannot penetrate cell membranes and inactivate intracellular viruses. During initial development of the MB technology, MB-treated plasma had a faint blue tinge; transfusion of large numbers of units could cause a slight, temporary discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes in recipients. However, the technology was modified to include filters that remove the MB prior to transfusion. Such products have reduced concentrations of some coagulation factors (eg, fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII) and thus may be less effective for certain patients who require high levels of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H502703822\"><span class=\"h4\">UV light alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain wavelengths of UV light also can cause DNA damage independent of chemical crosslinking compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. An example is short wavelength UV light (UVC). This method is used in the Theraflex system for pathogen inactivation of platelets. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70631351\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathogen inactivation technologies have several potential limitations, related to their efficacy, possible toxicity, possible reduction in component quality, and cost.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incompleteness of inactivation</strong> &ndash; Even with robust inactivation, there is a possibility that some pathogens can evade full inactivation. As an example, inactivation technologies have been demonstrated to reduce a target virus by six logs (to 0.0001 percent of the starting concentration); however, some pathogens can be present at even higher concentrations. Despite this theoretical concern, transmission of enveloped viruses has not been reported with <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Plasma/FFP'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The possibility of transfusion-transmitted viral infection despite pathogen inactivation was illustrated in a case report of HIV transmission in Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The transmitting donation tested negative for HIV antibody and for HIV RNA by minipool nucleic acid testing; the latter test was negative because of low HIV viral load in the donation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Minipool testing'</a>). The unit was used to prepare RBCs, buffy coat-containing platelets, and plasma. The plasma was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> plus visible light (see <a href=\"#H3236042519\" class=\"local\">'Methylene blue+visible light'</a> above). Recipients of the platelets and plasma each became infected with a strain of HIV that was matched to that of the blood donor by viral RNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Given the low viral load in the donation, it is unclear why the MB treatment failed to prevent the HIV transmission from the plasma and platelet transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As noted above, methods that only target enveloped viruses (see <a href=\"#H2491276952\" class=\"local\">'Methods that damage lipids'</a> above) have in the past allowed transmission of non-enveloped viruses including HAV and parvovirus B19. Of these, parvovirus transmission has been documented more commonly; HAV transmission has occurred less frequently due to viremia being lower grade and less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Patients may also be at least partially protected from becoming infected with these viruses by antibodies to HAV and parvovirus in the pooled, <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D-treated</span> plasma. An additional protection required by regulatory authorities is screening of the final product to ensure that HAV and parvovirus B19 concentrations are below defined acceptable limits. Usually, input units are screened for these viruses before they are allowed to be included in the plasma pool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to inactivate prions</strong> &ndash; No known procedure that can be used with human blood or plasma has been shown to inactivate prions, the abnormally folded proteins that are associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or variant CJD (vCJD). Governmental regulators in the United States and other countries have adopted a conservative position with regard to vCJD transmission in which individuals with potential exposure to prion diseases are not used as donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;, section on 'Prion disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Transfusion-related vCJD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential for lack of efficacy against new or unrecognized pathogens</strong> &ndash; It is possible that new or previously unrecognized pathogens might not be inactivated by available methods. Importantly, however, pathogen inactivation technologies as a general approach to improving the safety of the blood supply are more likely to be effective in reducing the transmission of new or previously unrecognized pathogens than approaches involving identification of infected donors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> products, because inactivation processes work against entire classes of pathogens rather than requiring knowledge of a specific organism's characteristics and the specific host response (eg, whether the host will be symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> develop a serologic response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential for damaging or depleting plasma proteins</strong> &ndash; The potential for pathogen inactivation methods to affect the function of plasma proteins has been raised in certain settings. As an example, in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the ADAMTS13 protein in the plasma used for therapeutic plasma exchange (PEX, also abbreviated TPE) is thought to contribute to PEX efficacy and thus a theoretical concern might be raised regarding decreased ADAMTS13 activity due to the pathogen inactivation process. However, as discussed separately, available evidence suggests that pathogen-inactivated plasma and standard plasma have similar clinical benefit in patients with acquired TTP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H92432337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Overview of procedure and plasma products'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Amotosalen and UVA light treatment of FFP and PF24 did not alter levels of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, including protein S and protein C; factors V, VIII, IX, X, thrombin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor; and ADAMTS13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> treatment results in the loss of about 30 percent of selected clotting factors in plasma, including protein S, alpha-2 antiplasmin, and alpha-1 antitrypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. However, studies in which patients were randomly assigned to treatment with standard FFP or to treatment with <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> FFP have failed to show any difference in efficacy in various clinical settings including open heart surgery, liver disease, or liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/15,44,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,44,46,47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene blue</a> treatment also depletes some clotting factors including fibrinogen, factor V, and factor VIII. The clinical implications have not been well studied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential for damaging cellular components</strong> &ndash; The potential for pathogen inactivation methods to affect platelet function was addressed in a 2017 Cochrane review, which identified five randomized trials comparing pathogen-reduced platelets to untreated platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of bleeding, mortality, complications, or other bleeding outcomes, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Platelets'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential toxicities</strong> &ndash; Theoretical considerations have been raised about potential toxicities of pathogen inactivation methods, such as formation of potentially immunogenic neoantigens on RBCs, or causing direct damage to the recipient's cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/13,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,49</a>]. Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of amotosalen (S-59). There has not been evidence of significant adverse effects despite widespread use of some of these products for decades.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cost</strong> &ndash; Pathogen inactivated products are generally more expensive to prepare than products that have not undergone pathogen inactivation. Cost effectiveness is a legitimate concern because of the large number of units transfused. It is especially challenging to demonstrate clinical benefit and related cost-savings of pathogen inactivation procedures in resource-rich countries, in which numerous other donor screening and laboratory testing procedures have resulted in an extremely low (in the case of some pathogens, negligible) likelihood of pathogen transmission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cost effectiveness calculations also need to take into account the specific product costs, storage conditions, and shelf-life of existing products. As an example, plasma products can be frozen, which both reduces the survival of certain pathogens (eg, bacteria) and extends the shelf-life of the products. In contrast, platelets are stored at room temperature and have a very short shelf-life; pathogen inactivation procedures for platelets might allow the shelf-life to be extended and result in fewer units of platelets being discarded, which could produce cost savings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, some of the increased cost and time required for pathogen inactivation may be offset by the elimination of certain procedures such as irradiation of cellular products and the costs averted by preventing infections in recipients. (See <a href=\"#H445426785\" class=\"local\">'Potential benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3684305827\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE PRODUCTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma derivatives including fibrinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma derivatives include a variety of products containing proteins or combinations of proteins manufactured from human plasma.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plasma derivatives and recombinant DNA-produced coagulation factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, manufacture of plasma derivatives involves pooling of 500 to up to 10,000 liters of plasma; each liter represents approximately four units from whole blood donation or 1.7 plasmapheresis donations. The pooled plasma undergoes one or more purification and fractionation steps, often followed by freezing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lyophilization (drying). All of these steps contribute to pathogen inactivation by damaging proteins and membranes. As an example, freeze-drying used in lyophilization is highly effective in inactivating hepatitis A virus (by two to six logs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
