However, the volume transfused correlates with the risk of TACO, making TACO less likely with Cryoprecipitate than with FFP. </p><p>Patient risk factors include pre-existing cardiac and possibly renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Small stature, low body weight, extremes of age (eg, &lt;3 years, &gt;60 years), and hypoalbuminemia have also been suggested as TACO risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>The contribution of patient factors was illustrated in a 2014 retrospective Medicare database review of over 2 million transfusion admissions that included 1340 cases of TACO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following patient characteristics were associated with a greater odds ratio (OR) for TACO after adjustment for confounding variables:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; OR 2.08 for age &ge;85 years (compared with the reference population age 65 to 69)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of heart failure &ndash; OR 1.61</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex &ndash; OR 1.40</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White race &ndash; OR 1.38</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of chronic pulmonary disease &ndash; OR 1.19</p><p/><p>The risk of TACO also correlated with the number of units transfused:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two to four units &ndash; OR 2.00</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five to nine units &ndash; OR 3.10</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than nine units &ndash; OR 3.55</p><p/><p>In a 2013 case-control study involving 83 patients with TACO in the medical intensive care unit (ICU), positive fluid balance, larger amount of plasma transfused, and faster blood product infusion rate were associated with an increased likelihood of TACO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This informs prevention strategies including slower rates of infusion and diuresis. (See <a href=\"#H27658918\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4119079486\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true frequency of TACO is difficult to assess due to the lack of a highly sensitive and specific clinical parameter or laboratory test. In addition, under-reporting of TACO is likely, as mild respiratory distress that resolves with diuresis may not be reported to the transfusion medicine service or blood bank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Overall, TACO is estimated to occur in 1 percent or more of transfused individuals. The frequency appears to be higher in hospitalized patients, especially those in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the 2014 retrospective claims-based study of Medicare patients mentioned above, TACO accounted for 1340 of 2,147,038 inpatient transfusion reactions (0.06 percent), equivalent to an overall rate of 62.4 per 100,000 hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At the other extreme, TACO was observed in 51 of 901 patients (6 percent) in a medical ICU who received a transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Perioperative series have reported rates in the range of 1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. TACO appears to occur at similar rates in men and women, although this has not been studied rigorously and the rate was slightly higher in women than men in the study discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3033979829\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p>A study from the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) reporting system in the United Kingdom suggests that either the incidence of TACO, or, more likely, the recognition and reporting of TACO, has been increasing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. From 2007 to 2013, reports of TACO increased steadily, from 6 to 96; deaths increased from 1 to 12; and instances of major morbidity increased from 3 to 34.</p><p>The under-reporting of TACO was demonstrated in an analysis that compared a retrospective review of passively reported TACO cases over an eight-year period at a tertiary hospital with a one-month active surveillance period at the same institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By passive reporting, the prevalence of TACO was 1 in 1566 plasma transfusions (0.06 percent); in comparison, by active surveillance, TACO occurred in 4 of 84 patients (4.8 percent), none of which were reported to the blood bank.</p><p>Compared with other transfusion reactions, TACO is less common than urticaria and febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), but more common than anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR), or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In a 2014 report from Ireland, TACO accounted for 221 of 1071 serious transfusion reactions (21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other studies have found a similar proportion of transfusion reactions attributed to TACO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a 2014 report from Canada that focused exclusively on transfusion reactions associated with respiratory distress, TACO accounted for 26 of 83 reactions (31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>TACO has been reported to be a major contributing factor in mortality from transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction#H5406911\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;, section on 'Frequency of reactions'</a>.)</p><p>The SHOT report stated that in 2013 TACO contributed to 12 of 17 deaths (71 percent) and 43 of 143 instances of major morbidity (30 percent) in the UK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other data indicate that patients with TACO have extended lengths of stay in hospitals and intensive care units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27658912\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of TACO should be considered in any patient who has respiratory distress or hypertension during or within six hours of completing a transfusion. </p><p>The typical presentation of TACO includes respiratory distress (dyspnea, orthopnea) in a patient with known or unknown underlying heart failure who is receiving a transfusion, especially in the setting of positive fluid balance in the intensive care unit (ICU). The severity is variable, from mild dyspnea to acute respiratory decompensation. Headache is common and seizures have been reported. </p><p>Typically, symptoms occur after a significant proportion of the blood component or multiple units have been infused, up to (but usually sooner than) approximately six hours following completion of the infusion. </p><p>Findings on examination may include hypoxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension, tachycardia, a wide pulse pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> jugular venous distension. The cardiac examination may show an S3 heart sound, and the lung examination often reveals rales <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheezing. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1913736136\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4076756032\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals receiving a transfusion are monitored periodically and instructed to report any concerning symptoms including respiratory distress.</p><p>Additional monitoring may be appropriate in patients considered at higher than average risk of TACO (eg, in an intensive care unit, having a history of heart failure or kidney disease, elderly, those with a small blood volume, and those receiving large transfusion volumes). It may be helpful to develop local risk profile assessment tools or algorithms to use in the pre-transfusion assessment to identify high-risk patients.</p><p>Depending on the patient's risk profile, some combination or all of the following clinical parameters may be monitored:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiopulmonary examination for elevated jugular venous pressure, heart sounds, rales or wheezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid balance, if fluid intake and output measurements are available</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous pressure or pulmonary artery pressure, if a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter is in place</p><p/><p>The frequency of monitoring depends on the patient's underlying condition, the number of blood components transfused, and the rapidity of infusion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H918286530\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TACO should be suspected in a patient who develops respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypertension while receiving a transfusion or in the immediate post-transfusion period. The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular and pulmonary examination, as well as assessment for other possible causes of dyspnea (eg, evidence of deep vein thrombosis, findings of anaphylaxis). Guidelines for the evaluation of transfusion reactions including TACO have been published by the International Society for Blood Transfusion (ISBT), the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) of the British Society for Haematology, and the U.S. Biovigilance Network. However, there is no uniformly accepted set of diagnostic criteria for TACO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All proposed classification schemes require the development of a set of signs and symptoms to occur within six hours of transfusion; the exact number and set of signs and symptoms varies between definitions. Due to the lack of a definitive diagnostic test, clinical judgement is required to make the diagnosis, especially since many of the patients with suspected TACO may have complex medical conditions. </p><p>Signs and symptoms include: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory distress, dyspnea, or tachypnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or worsening pulmonary edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of positive fluid balance</p><p/><p>Oxygenation status should be assessed using pulse oximetry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial blood gas analysis, especially if pulse oximetry shows oxygenation to be low or declining. Chest radiography may be helpful and should be obtained to confirm pulmonary edema and eliminate other causes of respiratory distress (eg, pneumothorax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Chest radiography should be performed for all severe reactions associated with respiratory or hemodynamic compromise. Typical findings on chest radiography in TACO include pulmonary edema and in some cases cardiomegaly. Echocardiography is not routinely performed, but if done it would be expected to show abnormal systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic function.</p><p>However, treatment (see <a href=\"#H3077224007\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below) should not be delayed while awaiting the results of chest radiography if the diagnosis is considered likely, because these interventions may also be helpful for other transfusion reactions. An exception to this is when it is unclear whether the patient is experiencing TACO versus transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), since diuresis, which is critical to the management of TACO, is of no value (and may be harmful) in a patient with TRALI. The distinction between TACO and TRALI is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3749046851\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Additional testing may include brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), although this is not required for diagnosis. BNP and NT-proBNP are elevated in TACO and other forms of heart failure. This information may be helpful when combined with other clinical information, but by itself it is not particularly sensitive or specific for TACO (sensitivity and specificity in the 80 to 90 percent range) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In selected patients, echocardiography may be helpful in determining underlying cardiac abnormalities.</p><p>Often, the evaluation is focused on distinguishing TACO from TRALI, a transfusion reaction caused by immune mediators such as anti-leukocyte antibodies in the transfused component rather than the volume load. In some cases, the distinction between TACO and TRALI is relatively obvious; in others it may be difficult and require the use of multiple types of information as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 1</a>). Additional guidance on distinguishing TACO from TRALI should be sought from the transfusion medicine service or blood bank. This subject is discussed in more detail in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction#H6714408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;, section on 'Respiratory distress: TACO versus TRALI'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali#H1592582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>TACO is not known to cause fever, hives, or angioedema; patients with these symptoms should be evaluated for other transfusion reactions or medical conditions unrelated to the transfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94399 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with all suspected transfusion reactions, suspected TACO should be reported to the transfusion service <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood bank. The transfusion service may provide consultation regarding the option of modifying blood components for future transfusions (eg, smaller units, volume reduction) or suggest rapid diuresis as a treatment for severe volume overload. In addition, the transfusion service may help in the evaluation of the transfusion reaction, including the distinction between TACO and TRALI if needed.

Like TACO, patients with TRALI typically become symptomatic during, or within six hours of, a transfusion. Unlike TACO, the risk of TRALI is not related to the volume of the transfusion. TRALI may occur closer in time to the initiation of the transfusion (before significant volume is infused) and is often associated with hypotension, fever, and transient leukopenia. TRALI is not associated with an elevated N terminal Pro-BNP (NT Pro-BNP), central venous pressure, or pulmonary artery wedge pressure. In TRALI, the ratio of protein in the edema fluid to plasma is high, reflecting an exudate rather than a transudate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 1</a>).

Like TACO, these reactions may present with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an abnormal lung examination. Unlike TACO, anaphylactic transfusion reactions may occur closer in time to the initiation of the transfusion (before significant volume is infused); and anaphylaxis is not associated with an elevated N terminal Pro-BNP (NT Pro-BNP), central venous pressure, or pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Anaphylactic reactions may be accompanied by stridor, hypotension, or angioedema.

HF may be caused by a number of acute and chronic conditions other than TACO, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, or valvular disease. The term &quot;flash pulmonary edema&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a dramatic form of acute decompensated HF. Like TACO, HF unrelated to the current transfusion is characterized by dyspnea and evidence of pulmonary edema. Unlike TACO, HF from other causes is associated with evidence of another cause and lack of a temporal association with the transfusion. TACO and HF from other causes may (and often do) coexist.</p><p>Importantly, individuals who have received multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are at risk for transfusional iron overload, which can be associated with cardiac hemosiderosis, which may in turn cause cardiac dysfunction.

Risk factors include pre-existing cardiac and possibly renal dysfunction, extremes of age, small stature, low body weight, greater number of units transfused, and faster rate of infusion. (See <a href=\"#H3033979829\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true frequency of TACO is difficult to assess due to the lack of a highly sensitive and specific clinical parameter or laboratory test; under-reporting of TACO is likely. TACO is estimated to occur in 1 percent or more of transfused individuals overall, and at greater frequency in individuals in the intensive care unit (ICU). TACO is more common than anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTR), or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). (See <a href=\"#H4119079486\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of TACO should be considered in any patient who has respiratory distress (dyspnea, orthopnea) or hypertension during or within six hours of completing a transfusion, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease, in the setting of positive fluid balance, and in the ICU. (See <a href=\"#H27658912\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals receiving a transfusion are monitored periodically and instructed to report any concerning symptoms including respiratory distress; additional monitoring may be appropriate in those at higher risk of TACO. If a patient develops respiratory distress, the examination should focus on the cardiovascular and pulmonary findings, as well as assessment for other possible causes of dyspnea. Oxygenation status should be assessed, and chest radiography is usually indicated. Findings consistent with TACO include hypoxia, jugular venous distention, pulmonary rales, an S3 gallop, pulmonary edema on chest radiography, and elevated BNP or NT-BNP. (See <a href=\"#H1913736136\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes other transfusion reactions, especially TRALI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 1</a>); other causes of heart failure; and pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"#H3749046851\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of TACO is similar to that of other causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and includes fluid mobilization, supplementary oxygen, and assisted ventilation if indicated. All cases of suspected TACO should be reported to the transfusion service <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood bank.
