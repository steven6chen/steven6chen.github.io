Clinical features of atopic dermatitis include skin dryness, erythema, oozing and crusting, and lichenification. Pruritus is a hallmark of the condition and is responsible for much of the disease burden for patients and their families.</p><p>The goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms (pruritus and dermatitis), prevent exacerbations, and minimize therapeutic risks. Standard treatment modalities for the management of these patients are centered around the use of topical anti-inflammatory preparations and moisturization of the skin, but patients with severe disease may require phototherapy or systemic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Conventional therapy for atopic dermatitis is reviewed here.

Avoiding these situations is helpful for acute flares as well as for long-term management. Since atopic individuals tend to respond more readily to pruritic stimuli, anything that tends to induce itch in an individual should be avoided. </p><p>Adjunctive measures that can be useful in all patients with dermatitis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid trigger factors such as heat, low humidity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat skin infections such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and herpes simplex (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Management of infection'</a> below) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use antihistamines for sedation and control of itching (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Controlling pruritus'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat stress and anxiety</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61996713\"><span class=\"h3\">Aeroallergens and food allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is controversy regarding whether environmental or food allergies are exacerbating factors in patients with atopic dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypersensitivity to house dust mites (eg, <em>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</em>, <em>D. farinae</em>), animal danders, molds, and pollens is thought to be associated with flares of atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, although many atopic dermatitis patients are sensitized to house dust mites, reduction of house dust mite antigens in the atopic patient's environment does not seem to be useful for disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>There is a lack of evidence that dietary interventions are helpful in reducing the severity or preventing flares of atopic dermatitis in unselected patients. Although approximately 50 percent of children with atopic dermatitis may have positive skin prick tests or specific IgE to one or more food allergens (in particular, cow's milk, egg, wheat, and peanut), food sensitization is clinically irrelevant in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A systematic review of nine randomized trials including 421 children and adults with atopic eczema indicates that either milk and egg exclusion, a few-foods diet, or an elemental diet are not beneficial in unselected patients with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One study suggests that an egg-free diet may be helpful for infants with proven sensitivity to eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415282104\"><span class=\"h3\">Contact allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atopic individuals are at an increased risk for developing allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to nickel as well as many components of topical treatments (eg, fragrances, preservatives, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. ACD should be suspected when patients do not respond to appropriate topical therapy or when affected areas continue to spread beyond the usual flexural locations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintaining skin hydration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063295835\"><span class=\"h3\">Emollients and moisturizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin hydration is a key component of the overall management of patients with atopic dermatitis. Lotions, which have a high water and low oil content, can worsen xerosis via evaporation and trigger a flare of the disease. In contrast, thick creams, which have a low water content, or ointments (eg, petroleum jelly), which have zero water content, better protect against xerosis, but some patients may complain that they are greasy. To maintain skin hydration, emollients should be applied at least two times per day and immediately after bathing or hand-washing.</p><p>Since atopic skin is deficient in stratum corneum lipids (especially ceramide) and &quot;natural moisturizing factor&quot; (a mixture of hygroscopic amino acids resulting from filaggrin breakdown), moisturizers that contain those ingredients may be beneficial. There are a number of topical moisturizers available in the United States by prescription. These agents contain a variety of components intended to improve skin barrier function and are expensive. There are few data demonstrating their efficacy, but one randomized trial suggests that they are no more effective than over-the-counter emollients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A 2017 systematic review of 77 studies including 6603 participants (mean age 19 years) with mostly mild to moderate eczema evaluated the efficacy of emollients and moisturizers in reducing the signs and symptoms of eczema and the frequency of flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on both physician and patient assessment, the use of any moisturizers reduced eczema severity and itch compared with no use, resulted in fewer flares, and reduced the need for topical corticosteroids. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In three studies, patients found that a moisturizer containing glycyrrhetinic acid (a natural anti-inflammatory agent) was four times more effective than vehicle in reducing eczema severity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In four studies, patients using a cream containing urea (a humectant agent) reported improvement more often than those using a control cream without urea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three studies assessed a moisturizer containing glycerol (a humectant agent) versus control. More patients in the glycerol group experienced skin improvement, both by physician and patient assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four studies examined oat-containing moisturizers versus no treatment or control. No significant difference in skin improvement was noted between groups, although patients using oat moisturizers tended to have fewer flares and reduced need for topical corticosteroids.</p><p/><p>Emollients are best applied immediately after bathing when the skin is well hydrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3064118930\"><span class=\"h3\">Bathing frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some controversy exists concerning the frequency of bathing and whether showering or bathing is preferable in patients with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Most experts recommend a hydrating bath followed by immediate emollient application, but others recommend a shower of short duration. No well-designed studies have been published to address this controversy. We feel that either option is reasonable but suggest bathing to most patients whether bath or shower, rapid application of emollients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prescribed topical preparations immediately after is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Controlling pruritus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihistamines are widely used as a therapeutic adjunct in patients with atopic dermatitis to treat both pruritus and eye irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The evidence supporting their use is relatively weak since no large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with definitive conclusions have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, the sedating antihistamines appear to be most effective (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a>) although their major benefit is likely to be improved sleep. </p><p>Nonsedating preparations such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> may occasionally also be useful, especially when there is an urticarial component or concurrent allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Doses higher than normal may be necessary. In a single dose-finding randomized trial including 178 adult patients with atopic dermatitis, cetirizine 20 mg per day given for four weeks was more effective than placebo in reducing pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, a tricyclic antidepressant with potent H1 and H2 blocking properties, may be used as a second-line treatment if others fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, allergic contact dermatitis to this agent is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Topical calcineurin inhibitors appear to be effective in controlling pruritus. In a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials including 481 adult patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> 1% cream or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.03% to 0.1% ointment were more effective than vehicle in reducing pruritus (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.61-0.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Tepid baths to hydrate and cool the skin can also temporarily relieve itching. Wet dressings (wet wraps) help soothe the skin, reduce pruritus, reduce redness, d&eacute;bride crusts, and limit access to the skin. Emollients are applied to the skin, and dampened cotton garments are worn over the affected area and covered with a dry garment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The patient may use these dressings overnight if tolerated or change them every few hours during the day. Anti-pruritic ingredients such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenol</a>, menthol, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=camphor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">camphor</a> are found in some moisturizers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448799217\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education is an important component of the management of atopic dermatitis. A systematic review of nine randomized trials&nbsp;(2003 participants)&nbsp;of educational interventions for atopic dermatitis&nbsp;suggests that children and their parents or caregivers may benefit from structured education provided by nurses or multidisciplinary teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In the largest of these trials including 992 children and adolescents with atopic dermatitis and their families, a six-week education program was compared with no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The program consisted of two-hour weekly sessions covering medical, nutritional, and psychological issues, and were carried out by a multiprofessional team of dermatologists or pediatricians, psychologists, and dietitians. After one year, the decrease in the total severity score of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) was greater in the intervention group than in the control group. There was also a significant improvement in subjective assessment of severity, itching behavior, and emotional coping. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63127807\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the management of the individual patient, it is important that clinicians evaluate the extent and characteristics of the rash (eg, presence of erythema, excoriations, oozing, lichenification, clinical signs of bacterial superinfection) and ask general questions about itch, sleep, impact on daily activities, and persistence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Several disease severity scales (eg, the SCORAD index, the eczema area and severity index [EASI], and the patient-oriented eczema measure [POEM]) and patient quality of life measurement scales have been tested and validated for use in clinical trials, but they are not commonly used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A practical guide to visual assessment of eczema severity that also includes the evaluation of disease impact on quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing has been proposed by the United Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg57/resources/atopic-eczema-in-under-12s-diagnosis-and-management-975512529349&amp;token=4DwsUnU+yHseZwT+XceADKRry+zhx8AIAeZ7oX0Y9mNCuaHR8zOg7aAVuNNwt88wJcgoZtIaOmtNFJZ683tRqMbt6zSqShVDvt0tisJaQ//+sKLWThTsIML+YegtifgPKwTUOrO4iKktYDPZFMEFNQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4682\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Institute for Health and Care excellence</a>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; Areas of dry skin, infrequent itching (with or without small areas of redness); little impact on everyday activities, sleep, and psychosocial wellbeing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate</strong> &ndash; Areas of dry skin, frequent itching, redness (with or without excoriation and localized skin thickening); Moderate impact on everyday activities and psychosocial wellbeing, frequently disturbed sleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Widespread areas of dry skin, incessant itching, redness (with or without excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, oozing, cracking, and alteration of pigmentation); severe limitation of everyday activities and psychosocial functioning, nightly loss of sleep</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13383309\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH MILD DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022550\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topically applied corticosteroids and emollients are the mainstay of therapy for atopic dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F115549\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115549 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The choice of the corticosteroid potency should be based upon the patient's age, body area involved, and degree of skin inflammation. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be an alternative to topical corticosteroids, in particular for the treatment of the face, including the eyelids, neck, and skin folds. (See <a href=\"#H1063295835\" class=\"local\">'Emollients and moisturizers'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with mild atopic dermatitis, we suggest a low potency (groups five and six (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) corticosteroid cream or ointment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desonide</a> 0.05%, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 2.5%). Topical corticosteroids are applied one or two times per day for two to four weeks. Emollients should be liberally used multiple times per day in conjunction with topical corticosteroids. Emollients can be applied before or after topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>For patients with moderate disease, we suggest medium to high potency (groups three and four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) corticosteroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinolone</a> 0.025%, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 0.1%, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate 0.05%). In patients with acute flares, super high or high potency topical corticosteroids (group one to three (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) can be used for up to two weeks and then replaced with lower potency preparations until the lesions resolve. </p><p>The face and skin folds are areas that are at high risk for atrophy with corticosteroids. Initial therapy in these areas should start with a low potency steroid (group VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desonide</a> 0.05% ointment. High potency topical corticosteroids are generally avoided in skin folds and on the face; however, limited brief use (five to seven days) of potent corticosteroids may produce a rapid response after which patients can be switched to lower potency preparations. </p><p>Maintenance therapy that includes intermittent use of a topical corticosteroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor may help prevent relapse.

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor and inhibits downstream signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines of type 2 helper T lymphocytes (Th2) that are believed to play a key role in atopic diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dupilumab</a> was initially evaluated in four small, industry-sponsored, randomized trials in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In a subsequent phase IIb, randomized trial, 379 adult patients with chronic moderate to severe atopic dermatitis present for &ge;3 years were treated with dupilumab 300 mg once a week, 300 mg every two weeks, 200 mg every two weeks, 300 mg every four weeks, 100 mg every four weeks, or placebo once a week for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in the eczema area and severity index (EASI) score from baseline to week 16. At 16 weeks, patients in all the dupilumab treatment groups had a greater improvement in the EASI score compared with baseline than patients in the placebo group. The improvement was dose-dependent, with the largest effect seen in the 300 mg once-a-week and 300 mg every-two-weeks groups (-74 and -68 percent, respectively, versus -18 percent in the placebo group). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 12 of 318 (4 percent) patients in the dupilumab groups combined and in 4 of 61 (7 percent) in the placebo group. In an analysis of patient-reported outcomes, dupilumab was also associated with a dose-dependent improvement in pruritus, sleep, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dupilumab</a> 300 mg or placebo given by subcutaneous injection weekly or every other week was also evaluated in two phase III trials of identical design, SOLO1 and SOLO2, which included 671 and 708 adult patients with long-standing moderate to severe atopic dermatitis not controlled by topical treatments, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an investigator general assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) and a reduction from baseline of at least two points in the score at week 16. The secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a 75 percent improvement from baseline in the eczema area and severity index (EASI-75). At week 16, more patients in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo groups achieved the primary endpoint (approximately 40 versus 10 percent). There were no differences between trials and between weekly or biweekly dupilumab regimens. EASI-75 was achieved by 44 to 52 percent of patients receiving dupilumab versus 12 and 15 percent of those receiving placebo. Rescue treatment was required in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving placebo and 15 to 20 percent of those receiving dupilumab. Serious adverse events were rare in all groups; however, injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group. Exacerbation of atopic dermatitis was reported overall in three patients receiving dupilumab and in eight receiving placebo.</p><p>The results of these trials indicate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dupilumab</a> may be an alternative systemic therapy for long-standing atopic dermatitis in adults, despite the relatively low proportion of patients achieving complete or near-complete clearance after 16 weeks of treatment. The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab was subsequently evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In this study, 740 patients were treated with dupilumab 300 mg once weekly, dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo for 52 weeks. All patients received concurrent treatment with topical corticosteroids (or topical calcineurin inhibitors, if indicated) and were allowed to receive rescue treatments (topical or systemic medications or phototherapy) after two weeks of dupilumab. The two coprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients with both an IGA score of <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(clear/almost</span> clear) or two-point or higher reduction from baseline at week 52, and the proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 from baseline to week 52. At week 52, more patients in the dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids groups achieved the IGA endpoint and EASI-75 compared with those receiving placebo plus topical corticosteroids (approximately 40 versus 13 percent, and 65 versus 22 percent, respectively). The rates of adverse events were similar in the three groups (83 to 88 percent). Serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids groups than in the placebo plus topical corticosteroids group (7 and 16 percent, respectively); however, patients in the dupilumab groups experienced an approximately twofold higher frequency of eye disorders and noninfectious conjunctivitis. The results of this study support the use of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who do not respond to topical therapies alone and in whom other systemic treatments are contraindicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with atopic dermatitis are at increased risk for cutaneous bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

A meta-analysis of 95 observational studies found that 70 percent of patients with atopic dermatitis carried <em>S. aureus</em> on lesional skin (95% CI 66-74) and 39 percent on the nonlesional skin (95% CI 31-47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, in patients without frank clinical infection, the role of staphylococcal colonization in driving the disease severity is still unclear, although multiple lines of evidence indicate that a relationship between heavy colonization and eczema severity does exist. An analysis of data from studies including patients with mild or severe atopic dermatitis found a pooled colonization rate of 43 percent (95% CI 31-57) in patients with mild atopic dermatitis, compared with 83 percent (95% CI 74-89) in those with severe atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinically infected skin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the universal skin colonization with <em>S. aureus</em> in patients with atopic dermatitis, routine skin swabs for bacteriologic culture are not recommended.

Since sodium hypochlorite 6% solution (liquid chlorine bleach) has activity against <em>S. aureus</em>, including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA), diluted bleach baths (obtained by adding 0.5 cup or 120 mL of 6% bleach in a full bathtub [40 gallons or 150 L] of lukewarm water, or one-half of a teaspoon of bleach in one gallon or four liters of lukewarm water) have been suggested as an adjunct to topical treatment between episodes of clinical infection to reduce the cutaneous load of <em>S. aureus</em> and improve symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>However, studies evaluating the efficacy of bleach baths for atopic dermatitis have been scarce and inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>]. A meta-analysis of four small randomized trials (116 participants) found that bleach baths were not more effective than plain water baths at four weeks in decreasing the severity of atopic dermatitis as assessed by the eczema area and severity index (EASI) and by the body surface area involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Emollients and topical corticosteroids were permitted in all studies. Three of the four included studies also found a decrease in <em>S. aureus</em> density after both bleach and normal baths, without a significant difference between groups. Moreover, one of the included trials found that the addition of bleach baths to topical corticosteroids was not more effective than corticosteroids alone in reducing the skin colonization in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. </p><p>The results of this meta-analysis indicate that bathing per se (with or without bleach) may be effective in reducing the skin colonization from <em>S. aureus</em> and improving symptoms.

A systematic review found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oral antibiotics for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the absence of clinical infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>]. The same review found that topical antibiotics or antiseptics reduced colonization with <em>S. aureus </em>in patients with atopic dermatitis, but could not conclude that treatment with these agents in combination with topical corticosteroids induced greater clinical improvement than topical corticosteroids alone.

A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials of evening primrose oil for the treatment of eczema in children and adults did not find a significant difference in global eczema symptoms (assessed by both the participants and clinicians) between the active treatment and the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55644810\"><span class=\"h2\">Chinese herbal medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chinese herbal medications for atopic dermatitis have been used for many years, but their efficacy and safety have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>].

Two randomized trials, one performed in Japan and the other in the United States and United Kingdom found that the enhancement of a defective skin barrier with daily application of emollients in the first months of life reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants at increased risk (ie, those with a parent or sibling with atopic dermatitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,135</a>].</p><p>In the United States and United Kingdom trial, 124 neonates received daily emollients (oil, <span class=\"nowrap\">cream/gel,</span> or ointment) on the entire body surface. At 24 weeks, the cumulative incidence of atopic dermatitis was 22 percent in the emollient group versus 43 percent in the control group, with a relative risk reduction of 49 percent. </p><p>In the Japanese study, 118 neonates at increased risk of atopic dermatitis received a daily application of an emulsion-type emollient from the first week of life or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. At 32 weeks, 19 of 59 infants in the emollient group and 28 of 59 in the control group had developed atopic dermatitis (32 versus 43 percent, relative risk reduction 26 percent). There were no differences between the two groups in the levels of IgE against egg white. </p><p>Although the long-term efficacy of this treatment needs to be evaluated in larger studies with extended follow-up, emollient therapy from birth is a simple, inexpensive, and safe intervention that may prevent the onset of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that daily skin moisturization in the first six months of life is likely a cost-effective strategy for the prevention of atopic dermatitis; among several emollient products examined in the study, petrolatum was the most cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70359559\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics and dietary supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probiotic supplementation in pregnant mothers and infants at risk for atopic dermatitis may prevent the development of the disease in children younger than three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials including approximately 3500 participants found that probiotics given in the prenatal and postnatal period reduced the risk of atopic dermatitis in the first years of life in both children at high risk of atopic dermatitis and in those from the general population (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.52-0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. </p><p>However, two subsequent randomized trials did not confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>].

At two years, the cumulative frequency of eczema was similar in the probiotic and placebo groups (34 versus 32 percent; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.7-1.6). In another randomized trial including 184 children at high risk for allergic disease, probiotic supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactobacillus</a> rhamnosus GG during the first six months of life did not decrease the cumulative incidence of eczema at two years of age, compared with placebo (29 versus 31 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.59-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].

In the largest study, 107 children with a history of atopic dermatitis worsening during winter were treated with 1000 IU daily of vitamin D or placebo for one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The primary outcome was a reduction in the clinician-measured eczema area and severity index (EASI). At the end of the study, the mean decrease in the EASI score was 6.5 in the vitamin D group and 3.3 in the placebo group. </p><p>Although the results of these trials suggest that winter supplementation of vitamin D may be beneficial for patients with atopic dermatitis, larger well-designed studies are needed to clarify the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of atopic dermatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3521416233\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous international guidelines recommended the use of hydrolyzed formula for the prevention of allergic diseases in high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema/abstract/144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,145</a>].
