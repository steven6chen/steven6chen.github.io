This figure represents a 37 percent increase from 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Breast implants are performed both for breast enlargement, as above, and, in women who have undergone mastectomy for breast cancer, for breast reconstruction. </p><p>Today, silicone implants are the gold standard and used by most surgeons. Saline filled breast implants used to be the main prostheses used for breast augmentation. Although silicone gel implants provide a more natural appearance and feel, unfounded concerns about risk of connective tissue disease associated with silicone implants led to a moratorium on their use in the United States in 1992. This was lifted in November 2006, after further studies led to the conclusion that silicone gel implants expose patients to no demonstrable risk for connective tissue or rheumatologic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both silicone and saline implants have the disadvantages that additional surgery may be necessary, since the implants do not last a lifetime, and that periodic imaging studies may be needed to determine if implant rupture has occurred. </p><p>Breast implants in reconstruction are sometimes placed following the use of a tissue expander. In addition, acellular dermal matrix is often used as an adjunct to tissue expander and breast implant reconstructions. This matrix may assist in the shaping of the reconstructive breast and allow tissue expanders to be filled to higher volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Issues related to breast implant infections will be reviewed here. Breast cellulitis, which is another form of breast infection related to breast cancer surgery, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cellulitis-and-other-skin-disorders-of-the-breast\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cellulitis and other skin disorders of the breast&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection rates of 1.9 to 2.5 percent following breast augmentation surgery in general have been reported in several series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for infection associated with breast implants have not been adequately assessed in prospective studies with long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, the available data do not permit adequate evaluation of the relative importance of risk factors. Despite these limitations, the following factors are thought to be determinants of the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical technique appears to be important, with a higher infection risk with periareolar and transareolar approaches in which the endogenous flora may contaminate the implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast reconstruction using implants after mastectomy is associated with as much as a 10-fold increase in the rate of infection compared to breast augmentation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. In a study of over 18,000 commercially insured women who underwent mastectomy between 2004 and 2011, the overall incidence of surgical site infection within 180 days of surgery was 10.3 percent following mastectomy plus breast implantation (compared with 5.1 percent following mastectomy only and 10.7 percent following mastectomy plus flap) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The higher risk with breast reconstruction may be related to tissue scarring and skin atrophy resulting from prior cancer surgery and radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Lymph node dissection also may be an independent risk factor in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among women undergoing mastectomy, immediate, compared with delayed, reconstruction with implant placement is associated with infection, perhaps due to contamination of the operative field with endogenous flora during one-stage procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. As an example, in a multi-state retrospective cohort study that included over 10,000 women who had reconstruction after mastectomy, risk of surgical site infection was highest with immediate reconstruction (breast implants, tissue expanders, or immediate repair with autologous tissue within seven days, 8.9 percent risk), followed by delayed reconstruction after seven days (5.7 percent risk), followed by secondary reconstruction (immediate reconstruction followed by additional reconstruction more than seven days later, 3.2 percent risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite this, immediate breast reconstruction remains the more common approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of acellular dermal matrix as an adjunct to the placement of an implant or tissue expander is associated with higher rates of seroma formation and surgical site infections. In one meta-analysis, acellular dermal matrix use was associated with infection (OR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.04-2.06) but not explantation (OR 1.37, 95% CI: 0.89-2.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>The origin of individual implant-associated infection is often difficult to determine. The major causes are thought to be contamination from endogenous flora in early onset infections, while seeding of the implant due to secondary bacteremia from remote sites may be important in some late infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Rarely, breast implant infections have resulted from contaminated implants or the use of contaminated saline or contaminated marking solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and epidemiology of infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute and subacute breast implant infections are commonly due to gram-positive pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Cutibacterium</em> species, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and streptococci. However, gram-negative bacteria including <em>Pseudomonas</em> and anaerobes are also important pathogens in many case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/7,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,19</a>].</p><p>Implant-associated infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria usually become apparent several weeks following surgery. Typical clinical features include failure of the primary incision to heal or early dehiscence of a portion of the incision, and odorless serous or seropurulent drainage of fluid that is culture-negative on routine bacterial cultures. Acid-fast stains and cultures should be obtained in all cases of subacute infection, even when routine culture reveals skin flora.</p><p>Contaminated skin marking solution and tap water have been implicated as potential sources in small outbreaks of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>], but a source is not identified in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In another small outbreak, black sediment in the saline implants of patients undergoing revision surgery was due to contamination with <em>Curvularia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This dematiaceous mold was isolated from the sterile supply room where saline used to fill implants had been stored in bottles under a water-damaged ceiling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20460168\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20460176\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles of implant infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of prosthetic implant infections involves a complex interaction between the host, the device, and the bacteria causing the infection. In animal models, the presence of a subcutaneous foreign body reduces the minimal inoculum of <em>S. aureus</em> required to cause infection by a factor of more than 100,000, to as little as 100 colony-forming units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At least two factors contribute to this increase in risk: foreign bodies do not have a microcirculation, which is crucial for both host defense and the delivery of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; and the interaction of neutrophils with the foreign body can induce a neutrophil defect that may enhance the susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Adherent bacteria multiply and elaborate exopolysaccharides, also known as glycocalyx. Eventually, microcolonies of bacteria encased in glycocalyx coalesce to form a structure known as a biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>A majority of implant infections are caused by microorganisms that grow in biofilms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (eg, <em>Staphylococcus&nbsp;epidermidis</em>) and <em>S. aureus</em>. Microcolonies of bacteria in biofilms form complex communities, with intraspecies communication and adaptation through a process called quorum-sensing, which regulates both virulence and biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Bacteria near the surface of the biofilm are usually metabolically active and have access to nutrients that diffuse through the upper surface of the biofilm. In comparison, organisms deep within the biofilm are metabolically inactive or in various stages of dormancy, and are protected from host defenses such as phagocytes and antimicrobial penetration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biofilm'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20460198\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology of the breast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The breast contains endogenous flora derived from the nipple ducts. Bacteria colonizing the nipple ducts may gain access to deeper breast tissue, particularly during surgical or biopsy procedures. In samples obtained from women undergoing breast augmentation or reduction, coagulase-negative staphylococci were the predominant organism, being isolated from 53 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other aerobic organisms, each of which was present in less than 10 percent of specimens, were diphtheroids, lactobacilli, enterococci, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (3 percent). The major anaerobe was <em>Cutibacterium</em> <em>acnes</em>.</p><p>The endogenous flora can contaminate the prosthesis during implantation and be responsible for subsequent acute infections. (See <a href=\"#H20459910\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20459910\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast implant infections usually present in a bimodal fashion: during the acute postoperative period (six days to six weeks after surgery) or with late onset (more than six months after surgery).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early-onset infections of breast implants are typically associated with fever, breast pain, erythema, and purulent fluid or drainage at the site of the incision. However, some patients develop systemic signs and symptoms of infection at a time when the primary surgical site manifests little or no evidence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, toxic shock syndrome is a rare complication in the early postoperative period; it results from <em>S. aureus</em> infection that is usually acquired during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Symptoms in patients with toxic shock syndrome may begin as early as 12 to 24 hours after surgery, but the median time is four days after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Despite the severe systemic manifestations, the surgical site typically shows neither inflammation nor purulence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among individuals who underwent implantation using acellular dermal matrix, erythema of the breast within the first weeks postoperatively could also reflect &quot;red breast syndrome.&quot; It can be distinguished from infection in that the erythema only overlies the acellular dermal matrix and leukocytosis or systemic signs of infection are absent. It is felt to be an immune response and is self-limited. One particular acellular dermal matrix, Alloderm, appears to be the main culprit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute infections usually present with chronic pain, persistent drainage of serous or purulent fluid, failure of a portion of the incision to heal or remain healed, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> migration or extrusion of the implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late infections, occurring several months to years after implantation, are rare and usually result from secondary bacteremia due to a focus of infection at another body site or an invasive procedure. Early treatment of any potentially severe bacterial infection may limit this risk.</p><p/><p>Another late complication of breast implants is capsular contracture (contraction of the scar around the soft implant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The role of infection in the genesis of these contractures is unproven but suggested by the high incidence of bacteria grown in culture from these capsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,31</a>]. Some have proposed an important role for biofilm from coagulase-negative staphylococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20460176\" class=\"local\">'General principles of implant infection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of breast implant infection is typically first suspected from the clinical features of fever and erythema of the breast. </p><p>Ultrasonography should be performed to see if there is a fluid collection surrounding the implant. If fluid is present, aspiration should be performed under ultrasound guidance, since blind aspiration may lead to perforation and leakage of the implant. Aspirated fluid should be sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, and fungal and acid-fast bacilli cultures.</p><p>If tissue is removed, it should be sent for histopathologic examination and culture. Special stains to reveal acid-fast organisms should be routinely performed and a portion of the specimen should be sent for both bacterial and mycobacterial culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials or large cohort studies evaluating the management of breast implant infections. Although implant removal is often necessary to achieve cure of implant-associated infections, medical therapy is usually attempted first for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy is usually given empirically while the results of microbiologic cultures are pending. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some bacterial infections, such as a superficial cellulitis without periprosthetic fluid, or infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci or diphtheroids, may be treated successfully with medical therapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients and their surgeons are unwilling to accept the loss of the implant and the discomfort, cost, and disability required for removal, treatment, and replacement of a new implant until they are convinced that an attempt at medical therapy has failed.</p><p/><p>The potential efficacy of treating breast implant infection with antibiotic therapy alone was evaluated in a retrospective review of patients with breast implant infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight patients had mild infection, which was defined as warmth, swelling, or cellulitis without drainage. The patients were treated with oral antibiotics and all responded without requiring removal of the implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four patients had severe infection, which was defined as persistent swelling despite antibiotic therapy, purulent drainage, atypical organisms such as gram-negative rods or mycobacteria, or systemic signs of infection. Two of the implants were salvaged with antibiotic therapy alone. However, details regarding the duration and route of antibiotics (oral versus intravenous) and the follow-up period were not provided.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H913893\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An empiric antibiotic regimen should include coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococcus as well as gram-negative bacteria. One such regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two to three divided doses) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/tazobactam</span> (3.375 grams every six hours). If there is clinical response to initial therapy, patients can be switched to suitable oral alternatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, depending on culture results. </p><p>In subacute cases or in infections localized to the operative site without signs of systemic toxicity, an oral empiric regimen of antibiotics for 48 hours pending culture data is appropriate. In such cases, clinical deterioration or lack of response warrants hospitalization for further evaluation and parenteral antibiotic therapy (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>) until cultures return. </p><p>Subsequent antibiotic therapy should be based upon culture and susceptibility results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22153920\"><span class=\"h2\">Implant removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following initial antibiotic therapy, we recommend removal of the implant in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nontuberculous mycobacterial infection unless there has been a prompt and lasting response to medical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all fungal infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When systemic signs of sepsis persist after antibiotic therapy has been instituted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a prompt and lasting response to antibiotic therapy has not occurred.</p><p/><p>The timing of reimplantation is dependent upon the degree of infection and the causative organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some experts recommend four to six months or more before reimplantation, although there are no published trials to support this approach.</p><p>One-stage prosthesis exchange has been used in some patients with periprosthetic infection and exposure, but the evidence for the utility and long-term success of this approach is largely limited to single and small cases series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. More data are required before this approach can be recommended. While cases of overlying redness without frank purulence or granulations around the implant may be considered for this approach, we do not currently recommend &quot;one-step&quot; replacement of grossly infected implants.

However, these are small case series with limited follow-up. We do not advocate this approach and instead strongly favor removal, pocket debridement, and antibiotic therapy followed by delayed reimplantation.

Although systemic antibiotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> are widely used for prophylaxis at the time of implantation, there is little high-quality evidence to support their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In a systematic review of surgical site infections following aesthetic breast surgery, the estimated mean incidence of post-operative surgical site infection following augmentation surgery was 1.4 percent (range 0 to 1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. No reduction in infection rates was observed with the use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The Medical Letter treatment guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery noted that, although most consultants do not recommend prophylaxis for &quot;clean&quot; procedures such as breast surgery, some recommend prophylaxis for procedures that involve placement of prosthetic material such as saline breast implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Guidelines from multidisciplinary expert groups in the United States also recognize the low risk of surgical site infections with breast augmentation or reconstruction surgery and do not recommend routine antimicrobial prophylaxis for it, except for patients who have particular risk factors for infection, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, tobacco use, coexisting infections elsewhere, known colonization with microorganisms, and immunocompromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The first generation cephalosporin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (1 to 2 g IV) has been effective for most clean procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A single dose should be given within 60 minutes prior to the surgical incision.

Retrospective studies and limited prospective cohort studies have reported lower rates of surgical site infections and capsular contractures following irrigation of the implant pocket with a combination of antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>) and antiseptics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Although not proven in controlled clinical trials, pocket irrigation with an antibiotic solution is commonly performed by most plastic surgeons.</p><p>For women with existing breast implants, there are no well-established strategies to reduce the risk of subsequent implant infection. Although prophylactic antibiotics are commonly given to such women prior to dental procedures, there are no data to support the practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and we do not recommend it, even with invasive dental procedures. For women with breast implants who need to undergo surgical procedures, the antibiotics typically given for that procedure to prevent surgical site infection should suffice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20459812\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections of breast implants occur in approximately 2 to 2.5 percent of cases. Post-mastectomy implantation is associated with a higher risk of infection compared with breast augmentation alone. The use of particular surgical approaches or acellular dermal matrix may also increase the risk of infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most acute and subacute breast implant infections are due to gram-positive pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Cutibacterium</em> species, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and streptococci. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are also an important cause of subacute infections. Both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have been associated with late-onset infections, often secondary to bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology and epidemiology of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast implant infections usually have a bimodal presentation, during the acute postoperative period (six days to six weeks after surgery) or late (generally more than six months after surgery). Acute infections are usually associated with fever and breast pain, erythema, and drainage. Subacute infections may present with chronic pain, persistent drainage, failed healing of the incision site, or migration of the implant. (See <a href=\"#H20459910\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of implant infections is generally made by microbiological analysis of peri-implant fluid, which should be aspirated under ultrasound guidance and sent for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, and fungal and acid-fast bacilli cultures. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials or large cohort studies evaluating the management of breast implant infections. Some bacterial breast implant infections can be treated successfully with medical therapy alone. However, implant removal is often necessary for cure, particularly for mycobacterial and fungal infections. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with breast implant infections who present acutely or have evidence of systemic toxicity, we favor an empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy with a regimen effective against methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and gram-negative bacteria. An oral empiric regimen or deferment of antibiotics pending culture data is appropriate in subacute cases with localized infection without systemic toxicity. Patients who respond to initial parenteral therapy can switch to an oral regimen tailored to culture results. The duration of antimicrobial therapy depends on the infecting organism. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> is widely used to prevent surgical site infections despite the lack of evidence regarding the efficacy of this practice. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Documents/news-resources/statistics/2011-statistics/2011-cosmetic-procedures-trends-statistics.pdf (Accessed on November 04, 2013).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-implant-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chun YS, Verma K, Rosen H, et al.
