ECD was first described by Erdheim and Chester in 1930 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only several hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature since that time.</p><p>Histocytic disorders are thought to be derived from mononuclear phagocytic cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) or histiocytes. This group has generally been divided into Langerhans cell histiocytosis and non-Langerhans histiocytosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is so named for its presumed derivation from the Langerhans cells, which are specialized dendritic cells found in the skin and mucosa. In contrast, non-Langerhans histiocytoses are thought to be derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and management of ECD will be presented here. The diagnosis and management of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is presented separately.

Fewer than 500 cases have been reported in the published literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. ECD has been diagnosed in all age groups, but is most common in adults. The mean age at diagnosis is 53 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is a slight male predominance. Although there is speculation that ECD and other histiocyte disorders may represent an aberrant response to infection, no infectious etiology has been identified. There is no evidence that ECD is an inheritable genetic disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87913025\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECD, and the related histiocytic disorder Langerhans cell histiocytosis, are hematopoietic neoplasms that represent clonal proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. This finding was demonstrated by tracking of the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation in subsets of dendritic cells, mature monocytes, committed myeloid progenitors, and CD34+ cells of affected ECD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Furthermore, hematopoietic <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells that carry the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation can recapitulate the phenotype of ECD by differentiation in vitro and in a xenograft model. </p><p>Somatic mutations in components of the MAPK signaling pathway are present in most patients with ECD. <em>BRAF</em> V600E is found in approximately half of ECD cases, and mutation of this serine-threonine kinase enhances cell proliferation and survival by activating the <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK</span> signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Also associated with ECD are mutations in <em>NRAS, KRAS, ARAF, PIK3CA,</em> and<em> MAP2K1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. These findings have implications for treatment of ECD. (See <a href=\"#H801454\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801384\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of patients with ECD varies depending upon the sites of involvement. Most patients with ECD will have osseous involvement at the time of diagnosis and the vast majority will also have at least one non-osseous site of involvement. A subset of patients is asymptomatic with bone involvement detected at the time of radiography for unrelated conditions. </p><p>In a literature review that included data from 259 patients with histologically proven ECD, the most common clinical presentations were bone pain (26 percent), neurologic features (23 percent), diabetes insipidus (22 percent), and constitutional symptoms (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A retrospective case series of 37 patients reported involvement of the following sites, in order of decreasing frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long bones (95 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maxillary sinus, large vessels, and retroperitoneum (59 percent each)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart (57 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lungs (46 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (41 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin (27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary gland and orbit (22 percent each)</p><p/><p>Other case series have reported a similar pattern of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801391\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone involvement occurs in the majority of ECD patients. This most commonly manifests clinically as mild but persistent juxta-articular pain, particularly in the lower extremities. However, a subset of patients is asymptomatic and bone involvement is detected at the time of radiography for unrelated conditions. Bilateral and symmetric osteosclerosis of the diaphysis of the long bones is nearly universal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77396\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77396 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85923 \">image 2</a>). Osteosclerosis of the skull bones, particularly the facial bones, is also well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Bone lesions can be missed on plain radiographs. If there is a high clinical suspicion of osseous involvement and a plain radiograph is normal, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed.</p><p>A retrospective series of 11 patients with biopsy proven ECD who had undergone conventional radiography and bone scintigraphy reported bilateral and symmetric osteosclerosis of the diaphysis of the long bones in 98 percent of bone lesions visible on conventional radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The osteosclerosis was heterogeneous in 65 percent of the patients and homogeneous in 35 percent. The diaphysis was involved in all patients, and 83 percent of the lesions also involved the metaphysis. Partial epiphyseal involvement with sparing of the subchondral bone was also common, as were periostitis and endosteitis. Bone scintigraphy depicted tracer uptake in all bone lesions visible on radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52334\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52334 \">image 3</a>). MRI detected all abnormalities noted by plain radiograph and scintigraphy, and also depicted replacement of the normal fatty bone marrow by heterogeneous signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85924\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85924 \">image 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801398\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac involvement with ECD is seen in the majority of patients and is a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular involvement can range from valve abnormalities to conduction defects to periaortic fibrosis along the entire course of the vessel.</p><p>In a series of 37 patients systematically screened with electrocardiogram (ECG) and imaging (cardiac MRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography), 70 percent had abnormal heart imaging, and 12 of 32 had an abnormal ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The most common finding was infiltration of the right heart (including pseudo-tumor) in half of the patients. Periaortic fibrosis, periarterial infiltration of the coronary arteries, and pericardial <span class=\"nowrap\">thickening/effusion</span> were also common. </p><p>These findings were corroborated in a study of 23 consecutive patients undergoing a standardized cardiac MRI protocol. Ten patients (43 percent) had MRI evidence of cardiac involvement, with myocardial involvement in nine and pericardial involvement in nine. Six patients had thoracic large-vessel involvement together with cardiac lesions, whereas only one patient had thoracic aorta involvement without cardiac disease. Cardiac disease most commonly manifested as a posterior right atrial pseudotumor; also common was infiltration of the right atrioventricular sulcus with asymptomatic infiltration of the right coronary artery. In this study, ECD did not cause diffuse infiltration of the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>In another series, 31 percent of ECD-related deaths were deemed to be secondary to cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The causes of death included myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and symptomatic valve disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801405\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One-quarter to one-half of patients will have pulmonary involvement, either of the pleura, the lung parenchyma, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Pulmonary involvement may be asymptomatic or manifest as dyspnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Spirometry may show restrictive features and decreased diffuse capacity. Plain films are often normal. Findings on computed tomography of the chest include mediastinal infiltration, pleural <span class=\"nowrap\">thickening/effusion,</span> centrilobular nodular opacities, ground glass opacities, or lung cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If performed, fluid from bronchoalveolar lavage may contain macrophages and foamy histiocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Open-lung biopsies have demonstrated histiocytic infiltrates in a lymphangitic pattern with associated fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrates. Although dyspnea and progressive fibrosis leading to respiratory failure can occur, in one large series pulmonary involvement was not an independent predictor of decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801412\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroperitoneal involvement with ECD can manifest as a mass-like infiltrative lesion or as a rind-like lesion surrounding the kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This can lead to acute or, more commonly, slowly progressive renal insufficiency. Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes are often required to alleviate ureteral obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801419\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic involvement is seen in 40 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. Periorbital involvement is most common and can manifest as exophthalmos with or without vision changes. Xanthomas of the eyelid are frequently reported. Symptoms concerning for neurologic involvement include vision changes, excessive thirst or urination, ataxia, headache, weakness, cord compression, and loss of libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary involvement commonly manifests as central diabetes insipidus and other endocrinopathies. Pre-existing diabetes insipidus and endocrinopathies typically persist, even with radiographic regression of disease, and require specific management. In contrast, diabetes insipidus rarely develops late in the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Approximately one-third of patients have yellow plaques underneath the skin (xanthelasma), most commonly on the eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other skin lesions are generally multifocal, reddish-brown, and papulonodular in appearance, but have few other distinguishing characteristics.

Breast involvement usually presents as a palpable mass or nodule in one or both breasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Liver involvement may be detected on radiographic staging or manifest with abnormalities in transaminases, bilirubin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

ECD cells express the histiocyte marker CD68 and express CD163 and Factor XIIIa, but unlike Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), do not express CD1a or S100 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64303 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85925 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Birbeck granules (an ultrastructural finding on electron microscopy in LCH) are absent. Attempts to establish clonality have produced varied results, and are not used routinely for diagnosis, and although occasional clonal cytogenetic aberrations have been identified, none are characteristic or diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801440\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECD is diagnosed based upon the pathologic evaluation of involved tissue interpreted within the clinical context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/31,32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,37</a>]. ECD can be difficult to diagnose since it is a very rare disease with protean manifestations that can affect many organ systems. A biopsy of an osteosclerotic bone lesion is generally preferred, when possible. Decalcification of bone biopsy samples in preparation for histologic examination renders them unsuitable for genetic analysis. Biopsy should aim to attain enough tissue to allow for histologic review and reserve additional samples for genetic testing (ie, <em>BRAF</em> V600E). </p><p>ECD must be distinguished histologically and immuno-phenotypically from other histiocytic and dendritic cell disorders, metastatic solid or hematopoietic neoplasms, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic and macrophage activation syndromes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Langerhans cell histiocytosis</strong> &ndash; Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and ECD are both histiocytic diseases that can involve multiple sites, most commonly bones. Skin involvement is more common in LCH. The two entities can usually be distinguished by morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. ECD tumor cells lack central nuclear grooves and Birbeck granules typical of LCH cells, and unlike Langerhans cell histiocytosis, they do not express CD1a or S100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

While the bone abnormalities of ECD often are confined to bilateral and symmetric osteosclerosis of the diaphysis of the long bones, Paget&rsquo;s disease and POEMS syndrome generally cause less symmetric bone abnormalities and less specific localization. ECD can readily be distinguished from Paget&rsquo;s disease and POEMS syndrome by histologic and immunophenotypic findings on biopsy.

JXG belongs to the broad group of non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses and is typically a disorder of early childhood. JXG presents in the first two years of life as a solitary reddish or yellowish skin papule or nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69122 \">picture 5</a>), most often on the head, neck, and upper trunk. Histologically and immunophenotypically, JXG is indistinguishable from ECD. JXG generally follows a benign course with spontaneous resolution over a period of a few years. Less commonly, skin lesions can be multiple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81058 \">picture 6</a>). Extracutaneous or systemic forms (brain, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and retro-orbital tumors) are exceedingly rare and can be associated with considerable morbidity.

Unlike ECD, skin lesions are firm, indurated papules. Although the pathologic cells in RDD are the macrophages (CD14+, CD1a-, <span class=\"nowrap\">S100+/-,</span> CD68+), RDD is histologically distinct from the other histiocytic diseases because the macrophages have normal-appearing lymphocytes residing in the macrophage cytoplasm (emperipolesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erdheim-chester-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Cutaneous involvement is uncommon, but can mimic vasculitis, cutaneous lymphoma, or cutaneous involvement with LCH. Abdominal involvement is frequently confusing with primary or secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing mesenteritis, or a variety of retroperitoneal neoplasms including lymphoma and germ cell tumor.
