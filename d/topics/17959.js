Infection usually involves cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues but can occasionally occur in other sites, primarily in immunocompromised patients. Activities associated with the development of sporotrichosis include landscaping, rose gardening, and other activities that involve inoculation of soil through the skin.</p><p>Treatment of sporotrichosis varies with the type of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since most manifestations are subacute to chronic and localized, oral antifungal agents are usually preferred. The agent of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rare cases of life-threatening, visceral, or disseminated infection require therapy with intravenous amphotericin B, which is also used in patients who do not respond to itraconazole.</p><p>The treatment of the various manifestations of sporotrichosis will be reviewed. The approach is consistent with the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the management of sporotrichosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50353 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The basic biology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of sporotrichosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-biology-and-epidemiology-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic biology and epidemiology of sporotrichosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-sporotrichosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of sporotrichosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANTIFUNGAL AGENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of antifungal agent in patients with sporotrichosis is limited. In vitro susceptibility studies and clinical experience support <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> as the treatment of choice for patients with most forms of localized sporotrichosis, and amphotericin B as the preferred treatment for patients who are severely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> are poor second-line choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p>In vitro studies have demonstrated good activity for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, and the minimum inhibitory concentration for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> is low for most isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/4,5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9,10</a>]. Posaconazole has also been shown to be effective in a murine model of sporotrichosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but there have only been a few reports of patients who were treated with this agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Several reports have found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> has poor activity in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/4,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9</a>]. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isavuconazole-isavuconazonium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isavuconazole</a> does not appear very active in vitro against <em>S. schenckii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, only a small number of isolates have been studied. </p><p>One study established epidemiologic cutoff values to help define susceptibility to various antifungal agents by pooling data from 17 different laboratories (301 <em>S. schenckii </em>sensu stricto and 486 <em>S. brasiliensis</em> isolates were collected worldwide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The most active agents for both species were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> was also active, but too few data were available to calculate a cutoff value for this agent for either species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LYMPHOCUTANEOUS AND CUTANEOUS SPOROTRICHOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> is the drug of choice for the treatment of lymphocutaneous and cutaneous sporotrichosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50353 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sporotrichosis/abstract/1-3,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,15,16</a>].

We favor the 200 mg dose, since some patients will not respond to the lower dose and will require dose escalation.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoarticular sporotrichosis can generally be treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> 200 mg twice daily for at least 12 months since the infection is usually chronic and localized. Amphotericin B is recommended in patients with extensive disease as initial therapy and in those who have not responded to itraconazole. After the patient has shown a favorable response, therapy can be changed to oral itraconazole, 200 mg twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Osteoarticular sporotrichosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For meningeal sporotrichosis, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day intravenously for four to six weeks) is the drug of choice. Step-down therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, 200 mg twice daily, should be used after initial therapy with amphotericin B is completed and therapy should continue for at least 12 months. For patients with AIDS or ongoing immunosuppression from another cause, chronic suppression with 200 mg itraconazole daily is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Meningeal sporotrichosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For disseminated sporotrichosis, we suggest a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day intravenously). Step-down therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, 200 mg twice daily, should be started after the patient has shown a favorable response and therapy should be continued for at least 12 months. Chronic suppression should be considered for patients with AIDS or ongoing immunosuppression from another cause. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated sporotrichosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> should be checked after the patient has taken the drug for at least at least two weeks for pulmonary, osteoarticular, meningeal, and disseminated sporotrichosis to ensure adequate levels. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary sporotrichosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women with severe sporotrichosis, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day intravenously) is recommended. Azoles should not be given during pregnancy due to their teratogenicity. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of sporotrichosis in children is similar to that in adults, although the dosing differs.
