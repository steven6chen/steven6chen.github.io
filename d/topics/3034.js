(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-aa-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AA amyloidosis may complicate any chronic inflammatory condition, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), inflammatory bowel disease, familial periodic fever syndromes, chronic infections, and certain neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F112212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112212 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The major causes and approach to diagnosis of AA amyloidosis are presented here. The clinical manifestations and treatment of AA amyloidosis and the musculoskeletal and renal manifestations of amyloid diseases are discussed separately.

The most common organ system involved in AA amyloidosis is the kidney, although other organ systems are often also affected.

Inflammatory arthritides have become the most common causes, although chronic infections, particularly tuberculosis and osteomyelitis, were historically the predominant causes. With widespread availability of highly effective antimicrobial agents, the infectious causes have become less common in much of the world, and it is hoped that therapeutic advances in the treatment of rheumatologic and other inflammatory disorders with highly effective biologic agents will result in fewer patients developing amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Both the annual incidence and population prevalence of AA amyloidosis certainly appear to be decreasing in national surveys from some western countries, presumably reflecting advances in therapeutics of the underlying disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Studies of the prevalence of AA amyloidosis complicating juvenile arthritis from the 1960s and 1970s reported an almost 100-fold variation between the United States and Poland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. As a subsequent example, in familial Mediterranean fever, the development of AA amyloidosis is related to severity and duration of disease and homozygosity for the M694V variant, but in a large study, geography was identified as the leading risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Amyloidosis is more likely to occur in patients with poorly controlled, seropositive, severe, and longstanding disease occurring in association with other extraarticular manifestations. Renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiac manifestations of amyloidosis are most common, but in the majority of patients, the disease remains subclinical.</p><p>The reported postmortem incidence of amyloid complicating adult RA has generally ranged from 10 to 25 percent, although studies of patients from the 1930s and 1940s reported 60 percent involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In these studies, AA amyloid was clinically overt in only 25 to 50 percent, even after long periods of follow-up sampling, indicating the majority of cases were subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic disease diagnosed pre-mortem has been reported in 2 to 11 percent, with considerable variation among geographic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>]. In a 1999 population-based series of 1666 subjects with RA who had died in Finland, the prevalence of amyloidosis was 5.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Nephropathy was the most common presenting symptom, being manifested as proteinuria (70 percent) or impaired renal function. Other organ systems were less frequently involved: cardiomyopathy (9 percent), gastrointestinal symptoms (24 percent), and hepatomegaly (19 percent).</p><p>The development of amyloidosis has traditionally been associated with a relatively poor prognosis, unless the underlying RA can be effectively treated.

A 1994 report from Japan found a four-year survival rate of 58 percent from the time of diagnosis of amyloidosis, with renal failure contributing to 39 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; a subsequent series over a decade later reported an improvement to 67 months in the mean survival following the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In contrast with the time period sampled above, subsequent (1987 to 1997) surveys from Finland appeared to confirm a decreasing incidence of AA amyloid among RA patients, possibly reflecting the impact of newer drugs and treatment regimens and of more aggressive treatment standards for early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early reviews, juvenile chronic polyarthritis, also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), accounted for 43 percent of cases of amyloidosis occurring under age 18, with a 4 to 6 percent incidence reported among 389 cases of systemic JIA (Still's disease) followed over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-diagnosis-of-aa-amyloidosis-and-relation-to-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Renal involvement, manifested clinically as proteinuria, occurs in almost all affected patients.

However, other than the biopsy-related studies (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above), laboratory testing has little role in confirming the presence of AA amyloidosis. An important limitation regarding the ESR as a measure of inflammation in some patients with amyloidosis is the elevation seen in this assay in patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria, even in the absence of inflammation.</p><p>Demonstration of a sustained inflammation with a raised CRP, ESR (except in patients with chronic kidney disease, in whom the test may be elevated without inflammation), or other hepatic acute phase response testing is suggestive of chronic inflammation that might result in AA amyloidosis. We typically perform such testing every two to four weeks over at least a two-month period to assess inflammatory activity. It would be very unusual to have AA amyloidosis with a normal ESR and CRP. Serum amyloid apolipoprotein A (SAA), which is also predominantly synthesized in the liver, would be an alternative (and superior) marker for AA amyloid.

Chronic infections are responsible for a larger proportion of patients with AA amyloid in the developing world than in the United States and Europe. Susceptibility to AA amyloidosis among the various rheumatic diseases is determined by duration and severity of inflammation with contributions from additional genetic and environmental factors.
