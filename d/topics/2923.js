However, unexpected toxicities, including cardiovascular toxicities, often occur with many of these agents despite efforts to limit their actions specifically to cancer cells that contain the molecular target of interest. In contrast to anthracycline and anthracycline-like agents, efforts at prevention with molecularly targeted agents are in their infancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several reasons for this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecularly targeted agents are generally newer drugs with less clinical experience with their toxicity or toxicity management than with anthracyclines. Furthermore, patients at the highest risk for developing such cardiac toxicity are often excluded from clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of mechanistically new anti-neoplastic agents. As a result, unexpected toxicities often become more evident in post-registry databases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the critical need to increase our mechanistic understanding of physiologic and pathophysiologic cellular mechanisms in order to design rational &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; anticancer therapy, the clinical correlates of basic science discoveries are in most cases too vague or unexplained to provide information about expected side effects and how to prevent them with rational drug design. In most cases, we simply don&rsquo;t know if cardiovascular toxicity results from a direct effect of the drug on the intended molecular target, or if it represents an &ldquo;off-target&rdquo; effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To further complicate the development of generally applicable therapeutic approaches, evidence suggests that cardiovascular toxicity may not only occur during the course of treatment and worsen with higher cumulative doses, but it may resolve despite continued treatment, or may develop years after therapy is completed in some patients. We are also just beginning to understand how genetic predisposition may affect an individual&rsquo;s risk and clinical pattern of cardiovascular toxicity. Additional fundamental, clinical, and epidemiologic research is required to resolve these questions around the use of each of the existing classes of anticancer drugs and those that will become available in the future.</p><p/><p>Despite these limitations, some general principles apply for minimizing the development of cardiovascular toxicity across all classes of anticancer agents, including the molecularly targeted agents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the risk of cardiovascular toxicity and the need for treatment gradually increase if patients do not receive primary and secondary prevention measures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F99624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99624 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk may be achieved by measures &ldquo;that rest on common sense&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Management of pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, systolic or diastolic cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, metabolic disorders) should reasonably be optimized and a healthy lifestyle encouraged (cessation of smoking, weight reduction towards ideal, increased exercise) both before and after cancer therapy is begun.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is evidence that administration of certain cardiac agents (eg, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) to patients without cardiac risk factors may be beneficial. As an example, ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve outcomes and slow disease progression in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to a variety of causes. However, the role of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A separate question relates to the potential protective effect of ACE inhibitors for preventing the development of left ventricular dysfunction in response to chemotherapy in patients who are at risk. Patients with elevations in serum cardiac troponin levels in response to chemotherapy may be at an increased risk for developing impaired left ventricular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity#H2523887721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;, section on 'Troponins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The potential protective effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with elevated serum cardiac troponin following chemotherapy was evaluated in a randomized trial; the high-dose chemotherapy regimen included a variety of anthracycline-containing and nonanthracycline-containing agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. From a total population of 473 cancer patients, 114 with an elevated troponin T were randomly assigned to one year of treatment with the ACE inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> (2.5 mg daily, titrated to a maximum of 20 mg daily), or to no enalapril. After one year, patients assigned to no treatment had a significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), while those in the ACE inhibitor group did not (LVEF at 12 months 48 versus 62 percent). In addition, the primary endpoint, an absolute reduction in LVEF of 10 percent or more, was reached in 43 percent of the untreated patients, but in none of the patients treated with enalapril.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Secondary prevention measures such as these require that patients be monitored during and after cancer therapy and managed when toxicity signals appear. Potentially useful biomarkers for cardiotoxicity include elevation in cardiac markers (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] or troponin) and the development of systolic or diastolic dysfunction on tests such as echocardiography. Unfortunately, there are no universally applicable imaging modalities or markers to reliably predict the risk of developing post-treatment cardiovascular toxicity, and routine serial testing with these modalities cannot be recommended for all patients in the absence of clinical indications.
