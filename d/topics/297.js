Ischemia due to acute mesenteric arterial occlusion can be caused by embolic obstruction of the intestinal blood supply, most commonly to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Acute ischemia can also occur due to acute thrombotic obstruction, often in the setting of an already diseased mesenteric vessel (eg, atherosclerosis). </p><p>Acute mesenteric ischemia due to acute arterial obstruction involving the small intestine will be reviewed here. Colonic ischemia, chronic mesenteric ischemia, and other forms of mesenteric ischemia, including mesenteric venous occlusion and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, are reviewed elsewhere.

Ischemic injury to the intestine develops when there is insufficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients required for cellular metabolism. An overview of intestinal anatomy, normal intestinal vascular physiology, and the response to acute ischemia are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190363137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intestinal vascular anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190363532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Physiology and mechanisms of ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>The intestine may be able to compensate to some extent because of increased oxygen extraction as well as the presence of collateral flow pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89911 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The status of the collateral circulation is particularly important in determining the severity of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Acute superior mesenteric arterial occlusion, in the absence of preexisting stenosis such as with embolism, causes a greater reduction in blood flow compared with other causes of intestinal ischemia. This is due to the lack of collateralization in the presence of relatively normal arterial vasculature. By contrast, acute thrombosis of atherosclerotic lesions may have had the opportunity to develop collateral pathways to provide some degree of perfusion even in the setting of complete occlusion. Inciting factors such as dehydration or low cardiac output states can lead to acute thrombosis of even modest stenosis, causing typical signs and symptoms of acute mesenteric ischemia with no prior history. For some patients, progression from stenosis to occlusion can be asymptomatic due largely to a sufficient time course to develop these collaterals. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420418661\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF MESENTERIC ARTERIAL OCCLUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major causes of acute mesenteric arterial occlusion are mesenteric arterial embolism and mesenteric arterial thrombosis. In an autopsy study, the ratio of superior mesenteric embolus to thrombus ratio was 1.4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial embolism &ndash; Embolism to the mesenteric arteries, which may partially or completely occlude the arterial lumen, is most frequently due to dislodged thrombus from the left atrium, left ventricle, cardiac valves, or proximal aorta. Systemic embolization occurs in 22 to 50 percent of cases of infected endocarditis, with embolization to the viscera second only to cerebral embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A history of prior embolization is common. In an autopsy series, 19 percent had an acute myocardial infarction, 48 percent had remnant cardiac thrombus, and 68 percent had synchronous embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Emboli tend to lodge at points of normal anatomical narrowing, usually at a branching point of an artery. The large diameter and narrow takeoff angle of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) make it anatomically most susceptible to embolism. The inferior mesenteric artery is rarely affected due to its small caliber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The embolus usually lodges 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, in a tapered segment distal to the takeoff of the middle colic artery and sparing the first few jejunal branches, but approximately 15 percent of emboli lodge at the origin of the SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The middle segment of the jejunum, which is most distant from the collateral circulation of the celiac and inferior mesenteric arteries, is most often involved in the ischemic process, whereas the proximal jejunum is usually spared. Jejunal sparing suggests embolic occlusion rather than acute-on-chronic occlusion of the SMA related to atherosclerotic disease as the underlying cause of acute mesenteric ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110494\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110494 \">picture 2</a>). Concomitant arteriolar vasoconstriction usually occurs, further impairing intestinal blood flow and exacerbating the ischemia.

Therefore, thrombosis of the SMA or celiac axis usually occurs at the origin of the vessel, and involvement of at least two major mesenteric arteries is generally needed for the patient to have significant symptoms because of the development of the collateral circulation over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Traumatic injury can also lead to visceral artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unlike mesenteric venous thrombosis, there does not appear to be a significant association between inherited coagulation defects and mesenteric arterial thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p>Less frequently, acute mesenteric ischemia may also be observed in the setting of an underlying vasculitis, most commonly polyarteritis nodosa. Vasculitis affects the small- and medium-diameter arteries and can lead to acute segmental intestinal infarction, but it may be difficult to determine if acute symptoms are due to arterial occlusion or spasm (ie, nonocclusive ischemia). Fibrous intimal thickening is typically seen histologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Risk factors for arterial embolism or for atherosclerosis (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) may be present (see <a href=\"#H420418685\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). Symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia such as pain with meals and weight loss may be noted on the history. Plain films and cross-sectional abdominal imaging do not exclude mesenteric ischemia but may identify complications related to mesenteric ischemia (eg, necrosis, perforation) and indicate the need for immediate abdominal exploration, while also helping to exclude other obvious causes of abdominal pain (eg, volvulus, small bowel obstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/17-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-28</a>].

Bowel emptying, nausea, and vomiting are also common, but bloody bowel movements are less common, unless advanced ischemia is present. The patient may be subtherapeutic on previously prescribed antithrombotic therapy. A prior embolic event is present in approximately one-third of patients. It is particularly important in these patients to perform a complete vascular examination examining the carotid, upper extremity, and lower extremity pulses for evidence of reduced perfusion related to synchronous embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

However, in contrast to the classic description, one study noted that patients may not be cachectic, possibly due to earlier diagnosis or a relatively high proportion of patients who were overweight before the onset of symptoms. However, obtaining an antecedent history of chronic mesenteric ischemic symptoms may be helpful for differentiating thrombotic versus embolic occlusion and may potentially influence the choice of initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/11,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30</a>].

Rapid diagnosis is essential to prevent the catastrophic events associated with intestinal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>A definitive diagnosis of mesenteric arterial occlusion relies upon demonstrating the occlusion within the mesenteric arteries on imaging studies. High-resolution computed tomographic (CT) angiography is highly diagnostic for cases of acute mesenteric ischemia. In addition, based upon the appearance of vessels in the abdomen, it is possible to differentiate between embolic and thrombotic etiologies. Further information for operative planning, such as distal arterial reconstitution and choice of inflow vessel for surgical bypass, can also be obtained. In the setting of equivocal CT angiography findings, catheter-based angiography may be needed. For patients who present with advanced ischemia (bowel perforation and peritonitis) and hemodynamic instability, a diagnosis will necessarily be made in the operating room.

The hub of the introducer can be removed to clear any residual clots. Repeat arteriography is performed, and, if needed, repeated aspirations can be performed. An alternative to this method is an over-the-wire double lumen aspiration catheter (eg, Export), which may allow removal of smaller, more peripheral clots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110500\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110500 \">image 4</a>).</p><p>Catheter-directed thrombolysis is an alternative for cases of incomplete aspiration embolectomy or distal mesenteric embolization.

A general abdominal exploration should be performed, looking for obvious pathology or other signs of visceral embolization.</p><p>The extent and severity of intestinal ischemia, including the appearance of the abdominal contents (color, distention), peristalsis, arterial pulsations in the mesenteric arcades, and bleeding from cut surfaces, should be assessed. Although mesenteric arterial revascularization is preferably performed before bowel resection, areas of the small or large intestine that are clearly nonviable (ie, full-thickness ischemia with dilated, dark, paralyzed bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110502\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110502 \">picture 4</a>)) can be quickly resected using a damage control approach.

Mesenteric embolectomy is performed through a midline abdominal incision that allows full inspection of the bowel. The proximal superior mesenteric artery can be exposed at the root of the mesentery by retracting the transverse colon cephalad, mobilizing the distal duodenum, and palpating the SMA in the root of the mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110503 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>A transverse arteriotomy is made, through which 3-Fr or 4-Fr Fogarty embolectomy catheters can be introduced to extract the clot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110504 \">picture 6</a>). The catheters should be advanced distally as well as proximally. Absence of additional thrombus with multiple passes and restoration of pulsatile inflow confirms clearance of the artery. The vessel is flushed with heparin and the arteriotomy repaired primarily. If arterial inflow cannot be obtained, repeat mesenteric arteriography may be necessary. If inflow cannot be restored, bypass from the aorta or other location can be necessary.

Superior mesenteric artery bypass is the most practical method in the setting of acute mesenteric arterial occlusion. Other options include thromboendarterectomy and translocation; however, these techniques are less commonly used in the setting of acute mesenteric ischemia. Translocation (transection of the SMA distal to the occlusive lesion with reimplantation into the infrarenal aorta) is unlikely to be feasible in acute circumstances given the typically distal level of obstruction. For patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (or possibly acute-on-chronic disease), thromboendarterectomy may be an option if disease is confined to the origin of the visceral vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-mesenteric-ischemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic mesenteric ischemia&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Mesenteric bypass constructs a graft from the chosen inflow vessel (eg, aorta, iliac artery) to a site distal to the occlusive lesion. Autologous reversed saphenous vein may be the preferred conduit, but polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts reinforced with rings are a reasonable option for retrograde revascularizations to prevent kinking. However, in general, prosthetic reconstruction is discouraged in the acute setting, particularly in the face of abdominal contamination because of an increased high risk for graft infection. If native conduit is not available, angioplasty and stenting (antegrade or retrograde) may be a better option rather than placing a prosthetic graft within a contaminated field.

Prior to reestablishing arterial flow, dialogue with anesthesia should cover this foreseeable occurrence. Appropriate pharmacologic preparation should be initiated in advance to avoid sudden collapse of an otherwise stable-appearing patient.

In one review of 83 patients requiring revascularization for acute mesenteric ischemia, 24 percent required resection of a median length of 43 cm of bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The presence of Doppler signals over the serosal surface may be helpful in identifying potentially salvageable ischemic segments to be left in place for reevaluation at second-look operation; however, surgeon experience and visual inspection have been shown to be as accurate as other adjunctive diagnostic techniques in the intraoperative assessment of bowel viability. At the time of definitive abdominal closure, intravenous injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> dye with inspection of the intestine illuminated via a Wood's lamp can assist in determining remaining bowel viability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110506 \">picture 7</a>). With increasing availability, intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG) angiography is being used as an acceptable bowel assessment adjunct in lieu of fluorescein dye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Potential advantages include a shorter half-life, which allows for repeated use in less time, and decreased intestinal staining due to near-complete isolation in the intravascular space. </p><p>Restoration of bowel continuity can be performed during the index surgery for well-demarcated, clearly viable bowel segments. If bowel viability is in question or the patient is hemodynamically unstable, a damage control approach can be undertaken by resecting the nonviable segments and stapling the small bowel closed awaiting a second-look procedure to restore bowel continuity. </p><p>The abdominal wall is left open when repeat laparotomy is planned, which is particularly likely if there has been a significant interval of ischemia that leads to bowel edema with reperfusion. If closure is elected (eg, no necrotic bowel, minimal ischemic time), abdominal compartment pressures should be monitored.

Risk factors for acute mesenteric arterial occlusion include any process that increases the potential for embolism from the heart or proximal arterial vasculature or the risk for mesenteric arterial thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H420418649\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H420418685\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Embolism to the mesenteric arteries most commonly lodges 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in a tapered segment distal to the takeoff of the middle colic artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thrombosis of the mesenteric arteries is often superimposed on a preexisting stenosis due to atherosclerotic plaque. Mesenteric arterial thrombosis can also occur in the setting of vascular injury, spontaneous mesenteric dissection, aneurysm, or a previously placed mesenteric stent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early symptoms and clinical signs are nonspecific. Specific clinical features that suggest mesenteric arterial embolism or mesenteric arterial thrombus as a cause of acute mesenteric ischemia include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For acute embolic occlusion, the typical triad is an older adult patient with atrial fibrillation (or other source for embolism) and severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical examination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For mesenteric thrombosis, the typical patient is a patient with atherosclerosis risk factors and known peripheral artery disease who may or may not have an established diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia based upon symptoms of chronic postprandial abdominal pain, food aversion, and weight loss. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A definitive diagnosis of mesenteric arterial occlusion relies upon demonstrating the occlusion within the mesenteric arteries on imaging studies. For patients who present with acute abdominal findings on exam indicative of bowel infarction and peritonitis, the diagnosis will necessarily be made in the operating room at the time of emergent exploratory laparotomy. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography (without oral contrast) is the initial study of choice for evaluating hemodynamically stable patients with acute abdominal pain and clinical features suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190365308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Embolic occlusion appears as an oval-shaped thrombus surrounded by contrast in a noncalcified arterial segment located in the middle and distal portion of the proximal SMA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thrombotic occlusion appears as thrombus superimposed on a calcified occlusive lesion at the origin of the SMA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of treatment for patients with acute mesenteric ischemia is to restore intestinal blood flow as rapidly as possible after initial management that includes systemic anticoagulation and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, among others. Specific treatment depends upon the clinical status of the patient and the etiology and location of the occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H420418745\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are good-risk surgical candidates with indications for immediate laparotomy should be taken directly to the operating room for exploration. Mesenteric arterial revascularization is preferably performed before bowel resection, but areas of the small or large intestine that are clearly nonviable can be quickly resected using a damage control approach. (See <a href=\"#H213123316\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For mesenteric embolism, the traditional treatment is open surgical embolectomy. We prefer open surgical thrombectomy, but percutaneous aspiration of the clot and catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy are alternative approaches. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with mesenteric artery thrombosis, mesenteric bypass is the treatment of choice. Thrombectomy alone is unlikely to be durable. Intraoperative retrograde superior mesenteric artery angioplasty and stenting is another option, particularly in the presence of gross contamination where surgical bypass is more problematic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some hemodynamically stable patients with acute-on-chronic mesenteric artery occlusion, who do not have clinical signs of advanced bowel ischemia, can be observed while maintained on systemic anticoagulation, provided there is evidence of good collateral blood flow on vascular imaging studies. The patient should have serial clinical assessment with a low threshold to repeat abdominal imaging studies or, if abdominal symptoms progress, surgical or endovascular intervention. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are hemodynamically stable and who do not have clinical or radiologic signs of advanced intestinal ischemia may be candidates for a primary endovascular approach, which may include pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty (typically with arterial stent placement). For those who undergo endovascular intervention, there should be a low threshold to convert to open surgical exploration at any time if problems arise or the patient's clinical condition deteriorates. (See <a href=\"#H213140849\" class=\"local\">'Surgical versus endovascular intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A palliative approach may be the best option for poor-risk surgical candidates with extensive transmural infarction (eg, small bowel up to the midtransverse colon). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients after mesenteric revascularization, a second-look laparotomy 24 to 48 hours after the initial operation is needed to reevaluate the bowel. (See <a href=\"#H213124261\" class=\"local\">'Second-look laparotomy and abdominal wall closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management is aimed at preventing future embolic events with anticoagulation, and cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in those with thrombotic arterial occlusion related to atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H213124302\" class=\"local\">'Long-term medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following mesenteric artery stenting, the patient should have periodic surveillance. We obtain follow-up imaging, either using duplex ultrasound or CT angiography, at three months post-intervention, then every six months for up to two years, and annually thereafter provided there is no evidence for restenosis. For those with recurrent stenosis, reintervention may be needed to prevent stent occlusion, which can lead to recurrent symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H213124308\" class=\"local\">'Stent surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from acute mesenteric ischemia remains high, with most series not showing appreciable improvement despite an aggressive treatment regardless of approach. For open surgical approaches to revascularization, perioperative mortality ranges between 31 and 62 percent. The causes of perioperative death included ongoing mesenteric ischemia with intra-abdominal sepsis and multiorgan failure, cardiac causes, hemorrhage, and termination of care. (See <a href=\"#H1407067\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mesenteric-arterial-occlusion/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Boley SJ, Frieber W, Winslow PR, et al.
