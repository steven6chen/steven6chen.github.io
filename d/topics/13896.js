However, advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and post-cardiac arrest care have improved outcomes in select cohorts of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Among these advances are the use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and targeted temperature management (TTM), along with other interventions to improve the care of patients following cardiac arrest.</p><p>The critical interventions in post-cardiac arrest management will be reviewed here. Basic and advanced life support for adult victims of cardiac arrest and long-term care for survivors of cardiac arrest are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7082819\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR PROBLEMS AND GOALS OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the post-cardiac arrest patient is complex and must address multiple major problems simultaneously. Issues to be addressed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining and treating the cause of cardiac arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing brain injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing cardiovascular dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing problems that may arise from global ischemia and reperfusion injury</p><p/><p>Immediately following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, the patient can develop a number of problems due to medical comorbidities and the sequelae of ischemic injury sustained during the arrest. The most immediate threat to survival during the first minutes to hours is cardiovascular collapse. Interventions to optimize blood pressure and maintain end-organ perfusion (eg, boluses of IV fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes) can help prevent secondary injury from hypotension. Additional short-term goals during the first six hours of care include optimizing oxygenation and ventilation and correcting electrolyte abnormalities. Determination of the etiology of cardiac arrest and the initiation of relevant treatments are performed concurrently with resuscitation efforts in order to prevent recurrent arrest and optimize outcome. Evidence supports the use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) or targeted temperature management (TTM) to minimize brain injury and target body temperatures should be achieved within the first few hours following resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9724127\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE CAUSE AND EXTENT OF INJURY AFTER CARDIAC ARREST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), the etiology determines therapy. A focused history and physical examination are performed and diagnostic studies obtained in order to identify possible causes for the arrest and ongoing or imminent threats to life. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of SCA, but a broad differential diagnosis should be considered. Common etiologies for SCA are described in the attached tables and discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70060 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Etiology of SCD'</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac arrest sustained during trauma has different causes than nontraumatic arrest (assuming cardiac arrest did not precede and thereby cause the trauma) and is managed differently. Issues related to trauma management are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43368249\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients are comatose after resuscitation from SCA and cannot provide a history of present illness or preexisting conditions. Therefore, clinicians should speak with anyone who can provide insight into the history (eg, family, friends, witnesses, emergency medical services personnel) to help determine the etiology of SCA as rapidly as possible after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H919559\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination begins with an assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's). Airway patency and security are evaluated first. A dislodged endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube will rapidly lead to recurrent cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H43368342\" class=\"local\">'Initial interventions'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the airway is secure, ventilation is assessed. Listen for abnormal lung sounds (eg, asymmetry, wheezing, crackles), which suggest a pulmonary or cardiac problem, or possibly a malpositioned endotracheal tube.</p><p>Next, circulation and end-organ perfusion are evaluated. Pulse rate and character (eg, full, thready), blood pressure, and skin appearance (eg, pink, mottled, cool) provide clues to the adequacy of perfusion. A loud or harsh cardiac murmur or rub suggests a cardiac etiology. Tachycardia is expected immediately after ROSC; bradycardia suggests an abnormal cardiac response, hypoxia, or severe metabolic disturbance (eg, electrolyte abnormality).</p><p>A rigid abdomen suggests a surgical emergency or may be due to an air-filled stomach. Significant quantities of blood in the rectum or nasogastric tube suggest a hemorrhagic cause (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding). Extremity signs of deep venous thrombosis (eg, unilateral leg edema), IV drug abuse, or a source of sepsis may suggest a diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43368755\"><span class=\"h2\">Baseline neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baseline neurologic examination should be performed to help determine the possible cause, likely clinical course, and need for neurologic interventions (eg, therapeutic hypothermia [TH] or targeted temperature management [TTM]). The initial examination provides a baseline estimate of prognosis that can be modified based on additional information and observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Temporary avoidance or cessation of neuromuscular blockade and sedation is necessary for a valid examination. The examination may be delayed if long-acting drugs have been administered. Train-of-four testing can be used to determine the degree of neuromuscular blockade. Train-of-four testing and the neurologic examination in the patient with depressed mental status are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Asymmetric neurologic findings are not expected following ROSC and suggest a structural intracranial lesion. Brainstem responses, including the pupillary, corneal, oculocephalic, gag, and cough response to stimulation, correlate with survival and should be assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The Glasgow Coma Score or Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) Score should be determined, with particular attention paid to the motor score, which correlates closely with neurologic outcome. Patients who cannot perform purposeful movements or follow basic commands generally need specialized neurocritical care treatment including TH or TTM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43368801\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram, imaging studies, and laboratory tests, are usually required to determine the etiology of cardiac arrest, to confirm endotracheal tube positioning and assess for chest trauma from CPR, and to ascertain the involvement of specific organ systems and gauge the severity of injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70225156\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and primary arrhythmia are the most common causes for cardiac arrest. Following ROSC, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be rapidly obtained and evaluated for signs of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (including a new left bundle branch block) that requires emergency reperfusion therapy. Abnormalities of conduction intervals, electrical axis, and T-waves may provide clues to the etiology. As an example, a prolonged QTc interval may reflect a primary arrhythmia, accidental hypothermia, or an electrolyte abnormality. Evidence of right heart strain (eg, right axis deviation) may be present in the setting of pulmonary embolus.</p><p>Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), significant coronary artery disease is often present in the absence of an acute STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The incidence of coronary artery lesions is highest among patients whose presenting arrhythmia is ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. Thus, emergency cardiac catheterization may be needed in patients without a STEMI but who have a concerning story (antecedent chest pain or shortness of breath and cardiac risk factors) or whose presenting arrhythmia was VF or pulseless VT. (See <a href=\"#H43368525\" class=\"local\">'Coronary revascularization'</a> below.)</p><p>When the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is uncertain based on ECG findings, bedside echocardiography may demonstrate focal wall motion abnormalities, suggesting acute myocardial infarction. Global but not focal hypokinesis is expected following cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H9724141\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Ongoing cardiogenic shock may be the sole manifestation of ACS in some patients with ROSC. Such patients may benefit from reperfusion established via cardiac catheterization or from placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9724141\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtain chest radiography to evaluate for pulmonary pathology and to confirm proper positioning of the endotracheal tube and central venous catheter. Pulmonary edema and evidence of aspiration are common findings after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but may be unrelated to the cause of arrest. Pneumothorax or mediastinal abnormalities suggestive of aortic dissection represent ongoing threats to patient survival and require immediate intervention. Enlarged aorta or concerning mediastinal findings on chest radiograph should prompt CT scan imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bedside emergency ultrasound can help to identify causes of arrest that represent ongoing threats to life, including pericardial tamponade, pneumothorax, catastrophic pulmonary embolism (PE), and intraperitoneal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Ultrasound can be used to assess right ventricular size and function (which may be abnormal with PE), determine inferior vena cava diameter (which may be abnormal with hypovolemia), and assess global cardiac function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Unenhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the brain can detect early cerebral edema or intracranial hemorrhage in the comatose post-cardiac arrest patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Approximately 4 percent of patients in one series exhibited intracranial hemorrhage that was considered to be the cause of their arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], altering both expected prognosis and precluding the use of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CT of the chest is useful in cases of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, CT may be delayed if there is concern for acute renal injury. In this setting, if the clinician strongly suspects that a massive PE accounts for the patient's arrest, other imaging studies (eg, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, ultrasonography of the lower extremities) can be performed while treatment with empiric anticoagulation is started. The high incidence of abnormalities on chest radiograph limits the utility of <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with a markedly elevated lactate (&gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> traumatic mechanism, or clinical findings of peritonitis, CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is useful for determining an intra-abdominal cause of arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H919578\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing may provide insight into the cause of arrest, but is also necessary to evaluate the extent and progression of arrest-related injury to organ systems. In particular, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances require close monitoring during resuscitation and on-going management.</p><p>Following ROSC, we suggest the following approach to laboratory testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas measurements are obtained every six hours during therapeutic hypothermia (TH) or targeted temperature management (TTM) and rewarming to assess acid-base status and are used to guide ventilator management. Arterial vascular access is obtained routinely in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients given the need for frequent arterial blood gas measurements and the common use of vasopressor and inotropic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic serum electrolyte concentrations, including sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate, are obtained every six hours during TH and rewarming to detect abnormalities. Rapid fluctuations in serum potassium may occur as a result of ischemia, acidosis, and catecholamine administration. Both high and low potassium can cause arrhythmias and must be treated immediately. Note that hypokalemia is often accompanied by hypomagnesaemia, which should also be corrected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood counts are measured to detect anemia and other hematologic abnormalities. Profound anemia suggests blood loss as a factor contributing to cardiac arrest. Leukocytosis of 10,000 to 20,000 is common and may represent acute demargination of white blood cells and inflammation. Markedly elevated leukocytosis should prompt investigation of a cause other than cardiac arrest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum troponin is measured every 8 to 12 hours for 24 hours to detect myocardial injury. If initial measurements are elevated, testing continues until there is clear evidence they are decreasing. Cardiac arrest, CPR, and defibrillation often cause mild increases in the serum troponin (troponin I 0 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> but rising or higher levels suggest acute coronary artery occlusion. Using biomarkers to diagnose myocardial infarction in patients with renal injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-cardiac-biomarkers-in-patients-with-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum cardiac biomarkers in patients with renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum lactate concentration is measured every six hours during TH and rewarming. Initial lactate concentrations and the rate of lactate clearance correlate with survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lactic acidosis, with serum lactate concentrations up to approximately 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> is common after cardiac arrest, but higher levels suggest ongoing intra-abdominal or muscle compartment ischemia. Lactate should clear over time after adequate perfusion is restored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific toxicology studies may be obtained in patients with a history of drug ingestion, signs of a toxicologic syndrome (eg, sympathomimetic poisoning), or clinical suspicion of poisoning. As examples, myocardial infarction or arrhythmia may be caused by acute cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication, cardiopulmonary collapse may be precipitated by massive antidepressant overdose, and sedative overdose may contribute to and prolong coma independent of any brain injury sustained during a cardiac arrest. The presence of long-acting opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) may prompt use of a reversal agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>) before neurologic testing. Evaluation and management of the unresponsive and critically-ill poisoned patient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Ischemia can impair kidney and liver function, which may affect drug dosing and decisions to use intravenous contrast. Thus, we recommend initial measurements of renal and hepatic function. Most patients require central venous access, arterial access, and potentially other invasive procedures. Therefore, we recommend assessment of PT, aPTT, and INR along with initial laboratory testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9724162\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43368342\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must first ensure a patent and functioning airway. An obstructed airway can rapidly lead to recurrent cardiac arrest. If a temporizing rescue airway device (eg, laryngeal mask, laryngeal tube) was used during resuscitation, this is replaced with a definitive airway at the earliest opportunity. Stomach decompression with a gastric tube is indicated.</p><p>The details of airway management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733416\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the following guidelines for mechanical ventilation in the post-cardiac arrest patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Target a carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) approximately 40 mmHg (or end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> of approximately 35 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In observational studies, PaCO<sub>2</sub> in a normal range (35 to 45 mmHg) when measured at 37&deg;C is associated with better outcomes than higher or lower PaCO<sub>2 </sub>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Avoiding lower PaCO<sub>2</sub> prevents hypocapnia-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. Because of the temperature correction when induced hypothermia is used, the actual PaCO<sub>2</sub> in a patient may be slightly lower than the PaCO<sub>2 </sub>measured in the laboratory at 37&deg;C, making 40 mmHg a safer target at all temperatures than 35 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;94 percent. Avoid prolonged hyperoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;300 mmHg), which has been associated with worse outcomes.</p><p/><p>Management of mechanical ventilation in the post-cardiac arrest patient must balance the need to reverse hypoxia and acidosis with the potential deleterious effects of hyperventilation and hyperoxia. Specifically, routine hyperventilation should not be used to compensate for metabolic acidosis. The modes and management of mechanical ventilation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cerebrovascular responses to PaCO<sub>2</sub> persist after cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and hyperventilation causes cerebral vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Therefore, ventilation should be titrated to keep the PaCO<sub>2</sub> no lower than 40 to 45 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27</a>]. It is unknown if higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels contribute to vasodilation, hyperemia, or cerebral edema. Hyperventilation can also decrease preload, resulting in reduced cardiac output and coronary perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a systematic review of nine observational studies, normocarbia (PaCO2 35 to 45 mmHg) was associated with higher survival and better functional status at hospital discharge compared to hypocarbia or hypercarbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Hypoxia must be avoided in the post-cardiac arrest patient, but hyperoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;300 mmHg) may also be harmful. We suggest titrating the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to the lowest value necessary to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;94 percent, or the PaO<sub>2</sub> to around 100 mmHg. If the patient&rsquo;s core temperature is maintained at 33&deg;C, the PaO<sub>2</sub> reported by the laboratory may be higher than the patient&rsquo;s actual PaO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, in this clinical setting, maintaining a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 100 to120 mmHg is reasonable.</p><p>Although studies of supplemental oxygen in the setting of cardiac arrest are limited, our approach is supported by several retrospective studies. According to a systematic review of 14 observational studies, hyperoxia (defined as a PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;300 mmHg) was associated with increased in-patient mortality among patients with a ROSC following cardiac arrest (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 1.02-1.93), although not with a poor neurologic outcome (OR 1.62; 95% CI 0.87-3.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one cohort of 6326 post-cardiac arrest patients, the odds ratio for death among patients with hyperoxia (defined as PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;300 mmHg on the first arterial blood gas) was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5-2.2) compared to patients without hyperoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>However, not all studies support the importance of avoiding hyperoxia and the optimal oxygen level in the post-arrest patient remains an area of debate. A retrospective cohort study of 12,108 post-cardiac arrest patients evaluated the worst arterial blood gas obtained during the first 24 hours following resuscitation and found no difference in mortality between the hyperoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;300 mmHg) and normoxia (PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;300 and &gt;60 mmHg) groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, a randomized trial of 28 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found no difference in survival to hospital discharge among patients randomly assigned to a goal FiO<sub>2</sub> of 30 percent or 100 percent during the first hour of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3956184\"><span class=\"h2\">Ensuring adequate oxygen delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrapolating from research on sepsis, some researchers advocate maintaining a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) of &ge;70 percent in post-cardiac arrest patients, but whether this goal is optimal remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Given that the post-arrest syndrome can be similar to that of sepsis, our practice is to maintain ScvO<sub>2</sub> of &ge;70 percent and a hematocrit of 30 percent in patients with a presumed cardiac etiology for their arrest. This approach is similar to that of early-goal-directed therapy for sepsis.

However, there is no evidence to determine whether it is better to use corrected (pH-stat) or uncorrected (alpha-stat) values to adjust ventilation. It is prudent to target slightly higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> values in order to avoid accidental hyperventilation and the resulting cerebral vasoconstriction.</p><p>Note that the metabolic rate of the patient, and thus minute ventilation requirements, decrease as body temperature falls. A blood gas should be obtained after any major change in patient temperature (eg, when a patient treated with hypothermia reaches 33&deg;C).

Episodes of hypotension can cause secondary injury, in addition to any initial insult incurred during the arrest by the brain and other organs. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) should be above 65 mmHg to reverse the acute shock state, and preferably 80 to 100 mmHg to optimize cerebral perfusion.</p><p>When determining blood pressure goals, clinicians must balance the metabolic needs of an ischemic brain with the potential for overstressing a decompensated heart. Cerebral autoregulation is often impaired after cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], and brain perfusion declines when the MAP falls below 80 to 100 mmHg. However, if the MAP is adequate, regional cerebral perfusion matches metabolic activity, according to positron emission tomography (PET) studies in post-cardiac arrest patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Thus, maintaining an adequate MAP helps to avoid further brain injury. Maintaining central venous pressures between 8 to 12 mmHg and adequate urine output (&gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour) are additional perfusion goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>].</p><p>Volume replacement, with isotonic saline or lactated ringers, is used to maintain a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 to 12 mmHg. Lactated ringers may avoid hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in patients requiring large volume infusions during initial resuscitation.

Rapid infusion (infusion at maximal rate using a pressure bag) of 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of isotonic saline or other crystalloid at 4&deg;C is commonly used to induce hypothermia. In patients with known systolic dysfunction, a smaller volume of isotonic saline may be used. Once an adequate CVP has been established, patients whose MAP remains below 80 mmHg generally need treatment with an inotropic agent or vasopressor. Prior to CVP monitoring, it is reasonable to start vasoactive drugs in patients with hypotension that does not resolve after a rapid infusion of 2 L of isotonic crystalloid.</p><p>Inotropic and vasopressor support can mitigate the myocardial dysfunction that is common during the first 24 to 48 hours after cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/20,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,40</a>].

Thus, we recommend coronary artery catheterization in the post-arrest patient, with precise timing determined by the initial ECG, trajectory of cardiac biomarker levels, presence of shock, and competing needs of ongoing resuscitation procedures. Life-saving cardiovascular procedures should never be delayed because of coma, which may take days to resolve. Immediate discussion of these issues with an interventional cardiologist is appropriate for all patients who do not have an obvious non-cardiovascular etiology of arrest.

A meta-analysis of 11 studies that reported achieved temperature (including three randomized trials and 1381 patients total) found lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.64) and improved rate of good neurologic outcome (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.91-3.22) in cardiac arrest patients treated with temperature management compared to those not receiving such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

An observational study that included 179 patients who developed fever following rewarming reported worse neurologic outcomes in patients with a higher maximum temperature during pyrexia (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Overall, these data suggest that active control of the post-cardiac arrest patient's core temperature, with a target between 32 and 36&deg;C, followed by active avoidance of fever, is the optimal strategy to promote patient survival. In this section, our suggested approach and the evidence for temperature management, including TH, following cardiac arrest is reviewed. In this discussion, TH refers to a core body temperature maintained in the range of 32 to 34&deg;C; temperature control refers to a core temperature maintained no higher than 36&deg;C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691802\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients not following commands or showing purposeful movements following resuscitation from cardiac arrest should have their temperature managed. The only absolute contraindication for temperature management is an advanced directive that proscribes aggressive care or a medical scenario for which such care is not appropriate. TH should not be used in patients with active noncompressible bleeding, but TTM (core temperature maintained &le;36&deg;C) in this population is reasonable. Either TH or TTM may be used in pregnant or hemodynamically unstable patients, and those receiving coronary catheterization or thrombolytics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/8,19,45,46,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,45,46,54,55</a>].

Regardless of the strategy selected, a cooling device with a feedback mechanism is necessary to actively control patient temperature. Active control should be undertaken and maintained even if the patient is already mildly hypothermic at presentation.

There are limited data about longer treatment in animal studies, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has been treated with 72 hours of hypothermia.

The rate of temperature reduction using this method is comparable or faster than that achieved with endovascular catheters, but may result in pulmonary edema and increased diuretic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/63,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,78</a>]. Patients with a history of heart failure or severely compromised renal function, or signs of acute pulmonary edema, should not receive rapid fluid infusions to induce TH. Surface cooling measures or an intravenous cooling device should be used instead. Surface cooling methods, including ice packs, cooling blankets, and cooling vests can reduce the core body temperature by 0.5 to 1&deg;C per hour. In patients who cannot tolerate rapid fluid administration, cool water baths or cool water and fans can be used as an adjunct method to induce hypothermia, as is done to treat patients with heat exhaustion.</p><p>We induce TH by infusing 1 to 2 L of cold saline using a pressure bag, while simultaneously implementing surface cooling using cooling blankets above and below the patient, and ice packs applied to the axillae, groin, and neck (adjacent to major blood vessels).</p><p>When inducing TH, shivering is common and may be too fine to see. Therefore, sedation (and potentially neuromuscular blockade) is required to facilitate cooling. (See <a href=\"#H734207\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and suppression of shivering'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no evidence demonstrating the superiority of any cooling method and in clinical practice a combination of intravascular and surface cooling is commonly employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/4,5,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,33</a>]. The lone observational study comparing intravascular and surface cooling methods found that neither the time needed to reach the goal temperature nor neurologic outcome was significantly different in the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Both surface and intravascular cooling devices are effective at maintaining a goal temperature for 12 to 24 hours. However, the effect of mild temperature fluctuations and excessive hypothermia on patient outcomes is unknown, and thermostatically controlled devices provide the most precise minute-to-minute temperature regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Such devices are also used to maintain temperature and avoid fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734207\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation and suppression of shivering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shivering raises body temperature and must be suppressed in patients being treated with TH or temperature management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/76,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,81-83</a>]. Failure to suppress shivering is a common reason for delays in achieving goal temperatures when cooling patients. Therefore, we suggest titrating sedation to shivering suppression, rather than using standard sedation scales. High doses of sedatives are frequently necessary to accomplish this.</p><p>A continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, with or without intermittent treatment with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>), is one effective approach to sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. We start with a propofol infusion at 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute and titrate as needed to a maximum dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute. If this is ineffective, we add fentanyl in boluses of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> or as a continuous infusion starting between 25 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span>.</p><p>In hypotensive patients, a continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (2 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> is an effective alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, but accumulation of this drug may interfere with subsequent neurologic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated a decrease in metabolism and excretion of midazolam during the induction of TH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Consequently, patients receiving infusions of midazolam may require days to clear the drug. No studies have evaluated the effect of midazolam on neurologic prognostication after cardiac arrest.</p><p>Intermittent treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> can suppress shivering, but the proconvulsant effects of its primary metabolite normeperidine makes this drug unappealing, particularly in post-cardiac arrest patients. Moreover, meperidine is not recommended in patients with renal dysfunction, which is common in the post-cardiac arrest population. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexmedetomidine</a> has been shown to suppress the shivering threshold in healthy individuals, but its use is limited by the side effects of hypotension and bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>Neuromuscular blockade is highly effective at suppressing shivering, but can mask seizures, which develop in 3 to 44 percent of post-cardiac arrest patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/2,4,88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,88-91</a>].

The gold standard for core temperature measurement is central venous temperature, but several surrogates are available. In order of preference, surrogate monitoring methods include esophageal, bladder, or rectal probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Bladder temperature may be erroneous if urine output falls below 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. Rectal measurements may lag behind acute changes in core temperature by up to 1.5&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Many rectal temperature probes can also be placed in the esophagus, yielding a more accurate measurement. Axillary and tympanic measurements are inadequate and misleading during TH and should never be used.</p><p>During rewarming, the temperature should be raised gradually, with the rate of increase not exceeding 0.5&deg;C per hour. We, along with many other clinicians, advocate a rate of 0.2 to 0.25&deg;C per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/5,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,83</a>]. Rapid rewarming can cause electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia), cerebral edema, seizures, and other problems. In animal studies of traumatic brain injury, rapid rewarming (&gt;0.<span class=\"nowrap\">5&deg;C/hour)</span> eliminated the benefits of TH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].</p><p>Rapid rewarming can occur if the patient's temperature is not closely monitored. The original trials of TH used surface cooling and passive rewarming, but automated devices using surface or intravascular methods are now available to control temperatures during the induction, maintenance, and rewarming phases of TH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. If such devices are not available, manual rewarming can be employed.</p><p>Manual rewarming is performed most often when cooling blankets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ice packs have been used to cool the patient. One approach to gradual rewarming when a cooling blanket is in place is to increase the set point for the patient's temperature by 0.5&deg;C every three hours until a normal temperature is reached. As an example, if the patient's temperature is 33&deg;C, the blanket temperature is set for 33.5&deg;C. After three hours of rewarming, the temperature is then raised to 34&deg;C, and so on. In the case of ice packs, a few can be removed each hour and the rate of rewarming can be used to determine when additional ice should be removed if the patient is rewarming appropriately, or added if the patient is rewarming too quickly.</p><p>The rate of rewarming can also be increased by raising the room temperature, applying a convective heating device, using heating lamps, or warming the inspired air via the ventilator heating circuit on the humidifier. While there are no data to determine the optimal timing for adding each of these rewarming interventions, it is reasonable to add them one at a time to avoid the adverse effects from overly rapid rewarming.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9724232\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential adverse effects of therapeutic hypothermia (TH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most significant side effects of TH are impaired coagulation and increased risk of infection. In addition, TH can adversely affect several other physiologic processes.</p><p>TH induces a mild coagulopathy. With temperatures below 35&deg;C, clotting enzymes operate more slowly and platelets function less effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/99-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-102</a>]. As a result, some bleeding is seen in up to 20 percent of patients treated with TH, although transfusion is rarely required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/19,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,103</a>]. Data demonstrate the incidence of bleeding is not significantly greater among post-cardiac arrest patients treated with TH compared to those who remain normothermic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/2,3,50,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,50,104</a>].</p><p>The development of significant bleeding alters the balance of risk and benefit for TH. In the event of significant bleeding (eg, significant decrease in hemoglobin, hemodynamic instability, intracranial hemorrhage, noncompressible site), TH should be stopped and the patient rewarmed to a core temperature of 36&deg;C.</p><p>TH impairs leukocyte function. The incidence of significant infections is likely to increase if hypothermia is maintained longer than 24 hours. While an increase in infection rates was noted in several cohorts treated with 24 hours of TH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/2,19,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19,105</a>], these infections were not associated with increased mortality. In a large randomized trial, no significant difference in infection rates, including pneumonia, was found in patients whose temperature was maintained at 33&deg;C compared to patients maintained at 36&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Hypothermia slows cardiac conduction and can provoke arrhythmias, including bradycardia and QT interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. A heart rate in the 40s is common at 33&deg;C, but does not require intervention if the blood pressure is acceptable. If intervention is needed for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, animal studies report similar or improved first-shock success with defibrillation in specimens with mild hypothermia compared to those with normothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>].

Whether continuous EEG monitoring should be performed routinely following cardiac arrest is unclear, in part because of uncertainty as to whether aggressive treatment of epileptiform activity improves neurologic outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H710737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'How aggressively should one treat?'</a>.) </p><p>While our practice is to perform continuous EEG monitoring in all comatose post-cardiac arrest patients, this may not be feasible in all centers. Overall, available data suggest that EEG monitoring should be prioritized in patients who are most likely to survive with good neurologic function (eg, those whose initial brain CT shows no cerebral edema and for whom a structured neurologic examination reveals a functioning brainstem), because detection and treatment of seizures in this setting may be most likely to improve outcomes. The findings of a small cohort study suggest that intermittent and continuous EEG monitoring demonstrate comparable effectiveness for detecting epileptiform patterns in the post arrest patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Thus, clinical suspicion of nonconvulsive status epilepticus or daily intermittent EEG monitoring may be a reasonable monitoring plan. </p><p>Interpretation of EEG patterns in comatose patients after hypoxic brain injury can be difficult, and direct discussion with a consulting epileptologist at serial time points is often required to integrate clinical and electrographic data. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H2970645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>In addition to seizure detection, continuous EEG monitoring provides prognostic information. Definitions vary by study, but EEG patterns that are generally considered malignant in post-cardiac arrest patients include: non-convulsive status epilepticus, convulsive status epilepticus, myoclonic status epilepticus, and periodic epileptiform discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/141-143\" class=\"abstract_t\">141-143</a>]. In a series of 939 patients who received EEG monitoring after rewarming or when clinically indicated, 29 percent experienced seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. Those with seizures were less likely to survive. In another large cohort study, patients with an intact brainstem examination after cardiac arrest experienced an increase in mortality from 36 to 87 percent when malignant EEG patterns were encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. Malignant epileptiform patterns are less common in patients with early, diffuse cerebral edema: these patients usually have suppression-burst or complete suppression as their primary EEG pattern, and have a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1444654540\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylaxis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high-quality evidence that clearly demonstrates benefit from seizure prophylaxis in the post-cardiac arrest patient. Pending further research, we do not routinely give such prophylaxis.</p><p>We do recommend aggressive treatment when epileptiform discharges progress to outright seizures (either convulsive or nonconvulsive), based on reports of patients who survive following post-cardiac arrest status epilepticus. Treatment of seizures in this setting is challenging because many are refractory to single agent therapy, and the presence of epileptiform seizures may be a sign of severe brain injury. The literature is limited to single-center case series of nonstandardized treatments with a variety of agents, including valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>. In one series status epilepticus was successfully treated in 3 of 3 subjects, but all had poor neurologic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. In another series, 3 of 5 subjects who survived after treatment for status epilepticus had poor neurologic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. As there are no trials specifically comparing treatments for seizures after cardiac arrest, clinicians can use the same drugs and approaches for post-cardiac arrest seizures as are used for status epilepticus, which is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis#H2329061382\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H22466618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p>It is unclear whether treatment of epileptiform discharges that are not progressing into clear seizures is beneficial. Repetitive spike or sharp waves (typically generalized epileptiform discharges) can occur in up to 45 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. In one series, 9 of 20 (45 percent) patients with epileptiform discharges had good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. In another case series, among 46 of 139 patients with convulsive or nonconvulsive epileptiform discharges, 14 of 17 (82 percent) had a poor outcome with anticonvulsant drug treatment and 23 of 29 (79 percent) had a poor outcome without anticonvulsant drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. Because the benefit from anticonvulsant drugs is uncertain, we do not recommend treating epileptiform discharges unless they are increasing in frequency or showing signs of progressing to seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H664295002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'EEG patterns of definite NCSE'</a>.) &#160; &#160;</p><p>Myoclonic jerks and other movements are common after cardiac arrest and can be isolated (non-epileptic) or epileptic. EEG is generally required to distinguish the etiology (see <a href=\"#H3432370953\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above). No specific significance has been attributed to isolated myoclonic jerks in patients following cardiac arrest. Conversely, status myoclonus, defined as repetitive myoclonic jerks lasting more than 30 minutes, is an ominous sign. In 88 percent of cases, status myoclonus is associated with malignant burst patterns on EEG with suppression of background between bursts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. Case series report poor outcome after this malignant status myoclonus pattern, regardless of treatment. In 12 percent of cases, status myoclonus is associated with epileptiform discharges with continuous EEG background. Up to 50 percent of patients with this pattern recover to consciousness, though some continue to have myoclonus after hospital discharge (Lance-Adam&rsquo;s syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].</p><p>Myoclonic jerks can be suppressed with sedatives, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, which may facilitate mechanical ventilation or other critical care. However, we do not recommend any specific treatment of malignant status myoclonus. Various anticonvulsant drugs may reduce Lance-Adams variant myoclonus, and trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, or others are reasonable for individual patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9724254\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7082046\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of brain injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial illness severity is strongly associated with survival and good neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and primary arrhythmia are the most common causes of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), but a broad differential diagnosis should be considered. Common etiologies for SCA are described in the attached tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70060 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The airway is evaluated first. An obstructed airway will rapidly lead to recurrent cardiac arrest. Initial interventions include ensuring a patent and functioning airway and providing appropriate ventilation. Goals for mechanical ventilation include maintaining a PaCO<sub>2</sub> no lower than 40 to 45 mmHg and an oxygen saturation &gt;94 percent. The target PaCO<sub>2</sub> values are slightly higher in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). (See <a href=\"#H9724162\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baseline neurologic examination should be performed to help determine the possible cause, likely clinical course, and need for neurologic interventions. Temporary avoidance or cessation of neuromuscular blockade and sedation is necessary for a valid examination. Asymmetric neurologic findings are not expected following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and suggest a structural intracranial lesion. (See <a href=\"#H43368249\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H919559\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H43368755\" class=\"local\">'Baseline neurologic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic tests, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), imaging studies, and laboratory tests, are generally required to determine the etiology of cardiac arrest, to confirm endotracheal tube positioning and assess for chest trauma from CPR, and to ascertain the involvement of specific organ systems and gauge the severity of injury. Following the ROSC, a 12-lead ECG should be rapidly obtained and evaluated for signs of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (including a new left bundle branch block) that requires emergency reperfusion therapy. Commonly performed testing is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H70225156\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9724141\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H919578\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate blood pressure must be maintained to avoid exacerbating or causing ischemic brain injury. IV fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors may be needed. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be reserved for patients with recurrent or ongoing unstable arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H43368511\" class=\"local\">'Maintaining end-organ perfusion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H43368518\" class=\"local\">'Preventing arrhythmia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency coronary catheterization or medical reperfusion therapy is indicated for patients with ECG findings of STEMI. Regardless of ECG findings, emergency coronary catheterization may be needed for patients with ongoing hemodynamic instability or evidence of focal wall-motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. In general, we also suggest that coronary artery catheterization be performed in the post-arrest patient who does not have an obvious non-cardiovascular etiology of arrest, with precise timing determined by the initial ECG, trajectory of cardiac biomarker levels, presence of shock, and competing needs of ongoing resuscitation procedures. Life-saving cardiovascular procedures should never be delayed because of coma. Immediate consultation with an interventional cardiologist is appropriate for all such patients. (See <a href=\"#H43368525\" class=\"local\">'Coronary revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic injury is the most common cause of death in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Preventing hyperthermia during the first few hours after cardiac arrest reduces the risk of neurologic injury. Therefore, in patients who experience a ROSC following cardiac arrest, we recommend instituting active measures to prevent hyperthermia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In patients with deep coma, evidence of cerebral edema, or malignant EEG patterns, we suggest maintaining the patient's temperature at 33&deg;C for 24 hours, followed by gradual rewarming (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">25&deg;C/hour)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For facilities that are not experienced with TH, and for the management of uncomplicated patients without malignant EEG patterns, evidence of cerebral edema, or deep coma, we suggest maintaining the patient's temperature no higher than 36&deg;C for 24 hours, followed by gradual rewarming (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">25&deg;C/hour)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Methods for implementing and managing temperature control are described in the text.

TH induces a mild coagulopathy and should be stopped in the event of significant bleeding. Hypothermia leads to a &quot;cold diuresis,&quot; which in turn can cause hypovolemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Close monitoring of volume status and serum electrolyte concentrations is necessary during TH.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Writing Group Members, Mozaffarian D, Benjamin EJ, et al.
