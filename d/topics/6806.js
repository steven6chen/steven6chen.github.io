In an outpatient pulmonary practice, evaluation and management of persistent cough can account for up to 40 percent of the practice volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cough can be classified based upon the duration of the cough; within each category are likely diagnostic possibilities. Acute cough exists for less than three weeks and is most commonly due to an acute respiratory tract infection. Other considerations include an acute exacerbation of underlying chronic pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Cough that has been present longer than three weeks is either subacute (three to eight weeks) or chronic (more than eight weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients who seek medical attention for chronic cough are more likely to be female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Among patients with chronic cough, women tend to cough more often and to have heightened cough reflex sensitivity compared to men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The common etiologies, complications, and evaluation of subacute and chronic cough will be reviewed here. The treatment of subacute and chronic cough is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COUGH REFLEX ARC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a complex reflex arc. This is initiated by the irritation of cough receptors that exist not only in the epithelium of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, but also in the pericardium, esophagus, diaphragm, and stomach. Chemical receptors sensitive to acid, cold, heat, capsaicin-like compounds, and other chemical irritants trigger the cough reflex via activation of ion channels of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuronal-control-of-the-airways#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuronal control of the airways&quot;, section on 'Reflex regulation'</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical cough receptors can be stimulated by triggers such as touch or displacement. Laryngeal and tracheobronchial receptors respond to both mechanical and chemical stimuli.</p><p>Impulses from stimulated cough receptors traverse an afferent pathway via the vagus nerve to a &quot;cough center&quot; in the medulla, which itself may be under some control by higher cortical centers. Sex-related differences in cough reflex sensitivity explain the observation that women are more likely than men to develop chronic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-14</a>]. The cough center generates an efferent signal that travels down the vagus, phrenic, and spinal motor nerves to expiratory musculature to produce the cough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55232 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiologies of chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (due to postnasal drip), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1-3,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,15-20</a>]. However, a number of other important etiologies must also be considered in patients presenting with persistent cough. As an example, a post-infectious etiology is a particularly common cause of subacute cough, with the cough often lingering long after the other acute symptoms of the infection have dissipated. One study showed that in nearly half of patients, subacute cough was post infectious and resolved without specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cough may also be a complication of drug therapy, particularly with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.</p><p>Other less common causes of chronic cough include a number of disorders affecting the airways (nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, neoplasm, foreign body) or the pulmonary parenchyma (interstitial lung disease, lung abscess) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57282 \">table 1</a>). A cause is identified in 75 to 90 percent of patients with chronic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,17</a>]. However, some patients may experience chronic cough of unclear etiology for years, despite extensive evaluation. The etiology of so-called &quot;chronic idiopathic cough&quot; is unknown; exaggerated cough reflex sensitivity has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway cough syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest that upper airway cough syndrome related to postnasal drip is a common cause of subacute and chronic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2,3,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,17,21</a>]. Underlying reasons for postnasal drip include allergic, perennial nonallergic, and vasomotor rhinitis; acute nasopharyngitis; and sinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Once secretions are present in the upper airway, cough is probably induced by stimulation of cough receptors within the laryngeal mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of postnasal drip include frequent nasal discharge, a sensation of liquid dripping into the back of the throat, and frequent throat clearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, postnasal drip may also be &quot;silent,&quot; so that the absence of these symptoms does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Clues on physical examination are a cobblestone appearance to the nasopharyngeal mucosa and the presence of secretions in the nasopharynx.</p><p>Because the symptoms and signs of postnasal drip are nonspecific, there are no definitive criteria for its diagnosis, and it is ultimately the response to therapy that secures the diagnosis. When an alternative specific cause for cough is not apparent, empiric therapy of postnasal drip should be attempted before embarking on an extensive diagnostic work-up for other etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Radiographic evidence of mucosal thickening is a relatively nonspecific finding, and radiographic studies generally are not indicated unless empiric treatment of chronic rhinitis has failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is the second leading cause of persistent cough in adults, and the most common cause in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Cough due to asthma is commonly accompanied by episodic wheezing and dyspnea; however, it can also be the sole manifestation of a form of asthma called &quot;cough variant asthma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Cough variant asthma can progress to include wheezing and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of asthma is suggested when the patient is atopic or has a family history of asthma. Asthma-related cough may be seasonal, may follow an upper respiratory tract infection, or may worsen upon exposure to cold, dry air, dust, mold, or to certain fumes or fragrances. A cough accompanied by wheezing or dyspnea, or one that occurs following initiation of beta-blocker therapy also suggests asthma.</p><p>In some cases, the cough is accompanied by reversible airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In other patients, baseline spirometry is normal, but airways hyperreactivity can be demonstrated by bronchoprovocation testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>]. However, in a patient with persistent cough, the presence of reversible airflow obstruction or a positive bronchoprovocation test does not necessarily prove that the cough is secondary to asthma. One study, for example, evaluated the utility of spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator in predicting that asthma was responsible for cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Spirometry was falsely positive in 33 percent of patients, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge was falsely positive in 22 percent. Thus, the best way to confirm asthma as a cause of cough is to demonstrate improvement in the cough with appropriate therapy for asthma (eg, two to four weeks of inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]).</p><p>Patients with active asthma typically have eosinophilic bronchitis. The diagnosis of nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis should be considered in atopic patients with an idiopathic chronic cough and sputum eosinophilia in the absence of airway hyperreactivity. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been studied as a predictor of response to inhaled glucocorticoids in both asthma and in nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Exhaled NO and sputum eosinophilia are correlated in these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, some studies have shown exhaled NO to be a good predictor of response of chronic cough to inhaled steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], while other studies have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The explanation for this discrepancy may in part be related to what value is chosen to reflect an abnormally elevated exhaled NO. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroesophageal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux is often reported to be the second or third most common cause of persistent cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,2,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,17</a>], although it is the most common cause in some reports, occurring in 30 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. Many patients complain of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn or a sour taste in the mouth); however, these symptoms are absent in more than 40 percent of patients in whom cough is due to reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2,15,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,36,37</a>].

This effect was absent in control subjects without chronic cough. The acid-induced cough was significantly decreased by pretreatment with either inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> or a topical anesthetic (lignocaine) instilled into the esophagus.</p><p/><p>The presence of cough induced by gastroesophageal reflux may be suggested by an abnormal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow, but this study is negative in the majority of patients and many patients with reflux do not have cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Prolonged (24 hour) esophageal pH monitoring, ideally performed with event markers to allow correlation of cough with esophageal pH, is generally considered the optimal diagnostic study, with a sensitivity exceeding 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,2,15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,37</a>].

Typical LPR symptoms include <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphonia/hoarseness,</span> chronic cough, mild dysphagia and nonproductive throat clearing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngopharyngeal-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LPR is seen as primarily an upper esophageal sphincter (UES) problem that mainly occurs in the upright position during periods of physical exertion (eg, bending over, Valsalva, exercise). In contrast, GERD is felt to be a problem of the lower esophageal sphincter and mainly occurs in a recumbent position. There appears to be a lower incidence of esophageal dysmotility in LPR versus GERD.</p><p>Direct laryngoscopic evaluation can assist in the diagnosis of cough from reflux. Arytenoid erythema and edema and pharyngeal inflammation often suggest laryngeal and pharyngeal reflux, and when seen, suggest that a course of treatment for reflux is indicated with monitoring of the cough on such therapy.</p><p>Multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) has been used to assess laryngopharyngeal and high esophageal reflux in patients with chronic cough. Among 49 patients with unexplained chronic cough who underwent MII, 73 percent had nonacid proximal esophageal events. Furthermore, in the nearly half of these who went on to anti-reflux surgery, 100 percent had either total or significant resolution of cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The authors concluded that a &ldquo;pH-centric&rdquo; approach may well be inadequate to evaluate cough related to reflux, which may explain the debate still present in some circles on the relationship between GERD and cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of chronic cough in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can exceed 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], which may be related to GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Almost all patients are smokers, except a small number who have chronic exposure to and airway inflammation due to other fumes or dusts. Because of the high prevalence of smoking, chronic bronchitis remains one of the most frequent causes of chronic cough. However, most smokers with chronic bronchitis do not seek medical attention for their cough, and in most series of chronic cough, chronic bronchitis accounts for 5 percent or less of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The sputum produced is usually clear or white. A purulent appearance to sputum often suggests a concomitant upper or lower respiratory infection, such as acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or sinusitis. In any smoker who presents for evaluation of cough, one must ensure that the symptoms do not represent a change in a chronic cough that is suggestive of a neoplasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of infection in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchiectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiectasis results from severe, repeated, or persistent airway inflammation that leads to progressive airway damage. Bronchi become dilated and cystic, leading to poor mucus clearance, secretion pooling, and chronic infection of the lower respiratory tract. This, in turn, serves to worsen airway inflammation and bronchial destruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cough is a major symptom of bronchiectasis, and in some studies, bronchiectasis is the cause of chronic cough in 4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/2,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,73</a>]. While some patients with bronchiectasis have only a dry cough, most produce chronic sputum that is mucopurulent, and which becomes frankly purulent during an exacerbation. The lung examination may be surprisingly normal, but more often reveals focal or bilateral rhonchi, crackles, or wheezes. The chest radiograph may suggest the disease by demonstrating crowded lung markings, thickened bronchial walls, or small fluid-filled cystic structures. However, these findings are insensitive and nonspecific, and chest CT with high resolution imaging is the optimal method of securing the diagnosis.</p><p>Once bronchiectasis is diagnosed, one should attempt to define its cause. Focal bronchiectasis is often the result of a prolonged or severe remote lower respiratory infection. Multifocal bronchiectasis, especially in a middle aged woman, is often due to chronic lower airway infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). More diffuse bronchiectasis, especially in a younger individual, raises the possibility of cystic fibrosis or an immunoglobulin deficiency state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchogenic carcinoma is a feared diagnosis in which cough is present in a significant number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, lung cancer is the etiology in less than 2 percent of the cases of chronic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,2,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,74</a>]. Most cases of lung cancer that manifest with cough are due to neoplasms originating in the large central airways, where cough receptors are common. Physical examination may reveal focal wheezing or diminished breath sounds, indicative of focal airway obstruction from tumor. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis from extrapulmonary malignancies can also present as cough, but is generally accompanied by dyspnea.</p><p>Bronchogenic cancer should be considered as a possible etiology of cough in any current or former smoker, and should be particularly suspected in those with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new cough or a recent change in chronic &quot;smoker's cough&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough that persists more than one month following smoking cessation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoptysis that does not occur in the setting of an airway infection</p><p/><p>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic nonproductive cough, particularly in patients who lack any of the risk factors described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/75-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-79</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Asthma'</a> above.) In one series of 20 patients with chronic isolated (nonspecific) cough, no apparent cause, and no airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchial biopsy revealed eosinophilic bronchitis in 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Although bronchial mucosal biopsies are required to definitively diagnose eosinophilic bronchitis, a trial of therapy is usually performed without biopsy, since most patients respond well to inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/77,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,80</a>]. Airway eosinophils and basement membrane thickening are present in both asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis, but mast cell infiltration is noted only in asthmatics, which may explain the differences in airway reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>].</p><p>The natural history of nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is variable.

The diagnosis was made by laryngeal electromyography or videostroboscopy, usually after exclusion or treatment of other causes of chronic cough.</p><p>Chronic tonsillar enlargement has been proposed as a cause of chronic cough, but clinical evidence of this association is limited. One series of 236 patients referred for evaluation in a specialized clinic noted tonsillar enlargement in the absence of other known causes of chronic cough in eight individuals (3.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Following tonsillectomy, these patients had decreased cough sensitivity and significantly improved symptom control.

The etiology of the &quot;ear-cough&quot; (or oto-respiratory) reflex is related to stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold's nerve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].

While these pressures and velocities are responsible for the beneficial effects of cough on mucus clearance, they are also responsible for many of the complications of cough, including exhaustion, self-consciousness, insomnia, headache, dizziness, musculoskeletal pain, hoarseness, excessive perspiration, urinary incontinence, and concern that &quot;something is wrong&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63151\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63151 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults/abstract/1,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,101</a>].
