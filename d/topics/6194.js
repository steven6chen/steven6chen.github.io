Such studies have yielded widely variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. One of the highest incidence rates reported in the United States is from a population-based study that utilized governmental data on skin cancer procedures and skin cancer-related office visits to estimate the number of new skin cancer diagnoses in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The authors estimated that more than 3.5 million cases of invasive SCC, SCC in situ, BCC, and other less common nonmelanoma skin cancers occurred in 2006, which would suggest approximately 700,000 new SCC cases. A 2013 metaanalysis estimated the number of new SCC cases (excluding SCC in situ) in the United States white population in 2012 to be between 186,000 and 419,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of cutaneous SCC has increased over the past 20 years in the United States and other countries. This increase may be related to higher levels of sun exposure, tanning bed use, an increase in the aging population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and improved skin cancer detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Epidemiologic factors such as geographic location and ethnicity also appear to influence risk for cutaneous SCC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age-adjusted annual incidence of cutaneous SCC in the United States varies according to latitude. For example, the incidence of SCC is higher in Arizona than in New Hampshire (270 versus 97 per 100,000 in men and 110 versus 32 per 100,000 in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>A similar pattern of geographic variability exists globally with a higher incidence of cutaneous SCC closer to the equator. In Australia, for example, there are approximately 1035 and 472 cases per 100,000 for men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, the age-adjusted incidences for men and women in Finland are only about 6 and 4 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cutaneous SCC increases dramatically with age. It is infrequent in those under 45 years of age, although the incidence of cutaneous SCC is increasing significantly in young individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For those over 75, the incidence is approximately 5 to 10 times higher than the incidence in younger age groups and 50 to 300 times higher than for those under 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blacks, dark-skinned Asians, and other people with skin of color have low reported rates of cutaneous SCC, whereas light-skinned, non-Hispanic white populations have the highest reported rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. While the incidence of SCC in non-Hispanic white women and men in the United States has been estimated to be as high as 150 and 360 per 100,000 individuals, respectively, the incidence in black individuals is estimated to be 3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In dark-skinned people, SCC tends to arise on non-sun-exposed areas and is frequently associated with chronic inflammation, chronic wounds, or scarring.

If the damage is not repaired, a series of changes can result in malignant transformation. In particular, the p53 tumor suppressor gene often has point mutations specifically associated with damage caused by UVB radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An estimated 45 to 60 percent of SCCs have p53 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">UVB radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies indicate that cumulative sun exposure (principally UVB radiation) is the most important environmental cause of cutaneous SCC. In contrast, intense intermittent sun exposure (eg, sunburn, childhood exposure) is the most important risk factor for BCC and melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24-26</a>].

Observational studies suggest that the use of tanning beds increases the risk of both cutaneous SCC and BCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. A 2012 meta-analysis of observational studies found a 67 percent higher risk for SCC among subjects with a history of any tanning bed use compared with subjects who had never used tanning beds (relative risk 1.67, 95% CI 1.29-2.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p>Studies of sunless tanning creams suggest that there is no increase in the risk of skin tumors associated with use of these agents if proper sun protection is concurrently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation (such as that used for acne, tinea capitis, and cancer), grenz-rays (used for psoriasis and other skin diseases), and gamma rays are associated with the development of SCC and BCC. The risk associated with radiation exposure is dose-related and higher in sites that have the most sun exposure. The basal layer of the epidermis is more affected by radiation than the more superficial layers, with a higher relative risk of BCC compared with cutaneous SCC in exposed groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].
