Myocellular damage results in myocardial dysfunction leading to heart failure. In contrast to adults, the majority of children with myocarditis present with acute or fulminant disease usually due to a viral infection. Children with myocarditis are at risk for arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The natural course, management, and prognosis of myocarditis in children are reviewed here. The causes, incidence, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of myocarditis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261470914\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL COURSE AND APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral myocarditis can be considered a continuum of two or three disease processes, which transition from one to another in a seamless manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis&quot;, section on 'Viral myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral infection phase</strong> is often reported as a prodromal presentation of fever, myalgia, and malaise several days prior to the onset of symptoms of heart dysfunction. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in this phase. Viral infection may result in direct myocyte injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children#H261467374\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;, section on 'Presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of antiviral agents has been proposed; however, their efficacy is unproven in the treatment of myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H261471172\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmunity and inflammatory phase</strong> is caused by activation of the host immune system by the primary viral infection. Inflammation triggered by T cell and cytokine activation, which can be detected by endomyocardial biopsy, results in myocyte injury leading to impaired contractility and heart failure. In most patients, the acute immune response declines with viral elimination, and left ventricular function recovers without sequelae within the first two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During this phase, a minority of patients will develop serious arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, or circulatory collapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;, section on 'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management during this phase usually includes supportive care. Immunosuppressive or immune modulatory therapies to reduce inflammation (ie, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a>) are also commonly used, but the data are inadequate to determine whether or not they are efficacious. Specific intervention for complications is required in more severely affected patients (eg, those with arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, or near circulatory collapse). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy phase</strong> occurs in a subset of patients. It remains uncertain why these patients develop chronic dilation. One proposed mechanism is based on a predisposing immunogenetic background that renders the individual more susceptible to a prolonged autoimmune response due to incomplete clearance of cardiac viral genomes or self-myocardial antigens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management during this phase is continuation of medical management for patients with heart failure, and in some patients, cardiac transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H261471413\" class=\"local\">'Chronic heart disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261470782\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the high risk of arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise during the acute inflammatory phase of the disease, children with myocarditis who present with significant ventricular dysfunction or rhythm disturbances should be cared for in a pediatric intensive care unit, if available. All patients require on-going cardiorespiratory monitoring, as the hemodynamic status of the patient may quickly deteriorate even if cardiac function is initially intact.</p><p>Therapy for pediatric myocarditis during the acute phase includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care to maintain hemodynamic stability and adequate systemic perfusion. In cases of fulminant disease, this may necessitate the use of mechanical support of the circulation using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a ventricular assist device (VAD) followed by cardiac transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection and treatment of arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although directed intervention including antiviral agents and immunomodulatory therapy has been proposed and in many cases used, confirmed evidence of benefit is lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At presentation, infants and children with myocarditis usually will have signs and symptoms of heart failure that include dyspnea at rest, exercise intolerance, syncope, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hepatomegaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60553 \">table 1</a>). Supportive care intervention depends on the degree of heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60553 \">table 1</a>). Initial supportive treatment consists of exogenous oxygen delivery, careful fluid resuscitation, nutritional support, and possible blood transfusion to increase oxygen carrying capacity. In some cases, more significant supportive care (eg, intravenous inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and mechanical circulatory support) may be needed during the acute illness prior to myocardial recovery, and in other cases, patients will progress to end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and require cardiac transplantation for long-term survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100898804\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with evidence of ventricular impairment, medical management with oral therapy generally includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Afterload reducing agents (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors)</p><p/><p>For more severely affected patients, medical intervention includes the use of intravenous agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dobutamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">milrinone</a> to prevent circulatory collapse. Sedation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation are used to decrease metabolic demand in patients with cardiogenic shock. Mechanical ventilation also provides left ventricular afterload reduction. Although positive pressure ventilation may provide hemodynamic benefit, induction and intubation carry significant risk of hemodynamic deterioration, and even cardiac arrest, in patients with severe myocardial dysfunction and low cardiac output. Practitioners should choose induction agents with minimal cardiodepressant or vasodilatory effects and should be prepared to institute resuscitative efforts, including mechanical support of the circulation with ECMO where available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management#H10100864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100898810\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and children with severe circulatory compromise despite medical management may need temporary mechanical circulatory support using ECMO or VAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Temporary circulatory support may allow myocardial recovery or serve as a bridge to transplantation, as demonstrated by the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the multicenter Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry data demonstrated 59 percent survival to hospital discharge for the patients with myocarditis who were supported with ECMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Seven patients underwent orthotopic heart transplant and six survived to hospital discharge. Of the 100 patients who did not survive, ECMO support was withdrawn in 70 cases, including in 58 patients who had multiple organ failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another review of 514 patients admitted with acute myocarditis from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, 17 of the 104 patients (16 percent) who were supported with ECMO or VAD underwent cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of the remaining patients who required temporary circulatory support, 25 died (24 percent), and the remaining patients showed recovery of myocardial function and survived to discharge after separation from VAD or ECMO support.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiarrhythmic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In suspected myocarditis, the presence of any arrhythmia is a direct clinical problem and also strongly suggests significant ventricular dysfunction. Loss of sinus rhythm may lead to acute deterioration or may exacerbate the symptoms of heart failure. In one series of 85 pediatric patients hospitalized with myocarditis, 38 (45 percent) had significant arrhythmias, with ventricular arrhythmias and complete heart block being the most common. The presence of arrhythmias conferred an eightfold increase in risk of need for mechanical support, heart transplant, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study using data from the Pediatric Health Information Services database on 2014 children with myocarditis, patients with tachyarrhythmias had a 2.3-fold increase in the odds of death, 58 percent increase in length of stay, and 28 percent increase in cost per day compared with those without tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, clinicians should maintain a high level of vigilance around monitoring for arrhythmias and recognize that arrhythmias may portend a poor outcome. Arrhythmias themselves increase the risk of hemodynamic deterioration. Additionally, most antiarrhythmic drugs have negative inotropic activity and may worsen cardiac function leading to acute hemodynamic instability. Thus, antiarrhythmic drugs should be used only when the expected benefit exceeds the risk, and only in consultation with a pediatric cardiologist or a clinician with experience in managing cardiac arrhythmias in children.</p><p>We recommend the following regimen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute hemodynamic instability should be converted electrically without delay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamically unstable'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly when associated with a rapid ventricular response, may induce or aggravate heart failure. These arrhythmias should be converted promptly, either with drugs or with electrical cardioversion if medical therapy is unsuccessful. Because the mechanisms of atrial arrhythmias in acute myocarditis are diverse and may be automatic or reentrant in nature, a single treatment strategy will not work for all patients and individualized therapy is essential. As an example, automatic atrial arrhythmias, such as ectopic atrial tachycardia, do not respond to electrical cardioversion or to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a>. A limited attempt at vagal maneuvers (Valsalva) may be utilized in stable, cooperative patients, but not in more unstable patients. In these patients, rapidly moving to more advanced therapy is warranted and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade ventricular ectopy should be treated cautiously with antiarrhythmic drugs. All antiarrhythmic drugs have significant side effects, and many have negative inotropic, vasodilatory, or proarrhythmic effects. Therefore, our choice of antiarrhythmic therapy is highly individualized based on patient characteristics. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amiodarone</a> is widely used to treat ventricular ectopy in adults and is a first line therapy in PALS (pediatric advanced life support) algorithms, the risk of adverse effects of amiodarone therapy is higher in sicker, younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The potential for hypotension and atrioventricular (AV) block is considerable, and extreme caution should be used when administering this agent, particularly in the young and sicker patients. Therefore, in patients with myocarditis with severe ventricular dysfunction and low cardiac output, this agent should be used only in collaboration with an experienced clinician. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-evaluation-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and evaluation of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete heart block with compromised cardiac output is an indication for transvenous pacing. This conduction abnormality is often transient; as a result, use of a temporary pacemaker should be the first step.</p><p/><p>Providing complete mechanical support of the circulation with ECMO or a VAD can be lifesaving in children with acute fulminant myocarditis and hemodynamically significant arrhythmias. Since many patients with fulminant disease recover completely if they can be supported through their acute illness, we use ECMO in the setting of a significant and persistent arrhythmia to allow myocardial recovery and safe pharmacologic therapy for the rhythm disturbance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261471146\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, myocardial damage in infectious myocarditis is thought to be due to both direct viral damage and the immune response to infection. This dual mechanism is the basis for proposing antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there is no confirmed evidence that these treatments are efficacious in the treatment of myocarditis. Based on the currently available information, we administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for children with acute myocarditis, which is confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy, or when clinical suspicion is high. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immunoglobulin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261471172\"><span class=\"h3\">Antiviral therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although limited data suggest interferon-beta treatment eliminates enteroviral and adenoviral genomes, which may improve function in patients with left ventricular impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it remains unclear whether there is sufficient benefit that outweighs the risk and cost of therapy. We do not recommend the use of routine antiviral therapy in children with myocarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunomodulatory therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunomodulatory therapy in the treatment of pediatric myocarditis remains controversial as data are limited and inconclusive on whether the use of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, immunomodulatory therapy is commonly used because myocarditis is associated with significant mortality and serious morbidity, and the risk of these interventions, particularly IVIG, is usually small in comparison.</p><p>This was illustrated in the previously mentioned study based on 514 patients identified from the PHIS database that noted of the 456 transplant-free survivors, 24 percent received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> therapy and 70 percent received IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of the 58 patients who either died or received a cardiac transplant, 53 percent received methylprednisolone and 72 percent received IVIG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence remains inconclusive on the benefit of corticosteroid therapy in patients with myocarditis. In a meta-analysis of trials that included children and adults, there was no difference in mortality between patients treated with corticosteroids and controls (relative risk [RR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.70-1.24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At one to three months follow-up, the group that received corticosteroids had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, mean difference [MD] 7.4%, 95% CI 4.94-9.79), but there was a substantial amount of heterogeneity among the studies. In a subanalysis of pediatric patients (n = 200), the level of improved LVEF associated with corticosteroid therapy was greater than in the overall cohort (MD 9%, 95% CI 7.48-10.52).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Intravenous immunoglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of IVIG to treat myocarditis was suggested by its efficacy in other immune-mediated diseases. Its use is also supported by experimental data in which polyclonal immunoglobulin protects against myocardial or arterial damage in mouse models of viral and autoimmune myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Although data from randomized controlled trials of IVIG for the treatment of myocarditis in children are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], some clinical evidence suggests it may be beneficial. In a retrospective review from two pediatric hospitals, 21 children with presumed acute myocarditis treated with high dose IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> over 24 hours) were compared with 25 historical controls treated with conventional supportive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients treated with IVIG demonstrated greater ventricular fractional shortening by echocardiography at 3 to 6 months and 6 to 12 months after treatment compared with controls, and smaller left ventricular end diastolic dimension at 3 to 6 months. There was a trend toward improved survival after one year in patients who received IVIG.</p><p>In contrast, another study using data from the PHIS database reported that the use of IVIG did not improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-myocarditis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this study of 216 patients, 45 percent of patients received IVIG and there was a trend towards more frequent use of IVIG in patients with extreme severity scores. Subanalysis based on severity index failed to show a survival advantage to patients who received IVIG in all subgroups, but this analysis was limited by the small number of deaths in each subgroup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the risk of death and significant morbidity associated with myocarditis, we administer high dose IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> over 24 hours) for children with acute myocarditis, which is confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy, or when clinical suspicion is high. IVIG is our preferred immunomodulatory agent, because corticosteroid therapy does not affect mortality and is associated with significant adverse effects. However, we reserve the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents for myocarditis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261471400\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261471413\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who progress from acute myocarditis to chronic heart failure, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">digoxin</a>, beta blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a>) are well-accepted therapies, and are discussed in greater detail separately.

Initial medical management of all patients with impaired heart function includes diuretic and afterload reducing agents (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). We recommend that patients with severe circulatory compromise despite conventional medical intervention be supported by temporary mechanical circulatory support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a ventricular assist device (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic stability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because most antiarrhythmic drugs have negative inotropic activity and may aggravate heart failure, the management of patients who experience cardiac arrhythmias including choice of interventions should be performed in consultation with a clinician experienced in managing cardiac arrhythmias in children. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the administration of high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> over 24 hours) in patients with acute myocarditis, which is confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy or when clinical suspicion is high. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We consider corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive agents, but generally reserve this treatment for myocarditis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases.
