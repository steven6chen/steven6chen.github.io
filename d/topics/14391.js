Procedural sedation reduces the discomfort, apprehension, and potential unpleasant memories associated with such procedures and facilitates performance of the procedure.</p><p>The practice of procedural sedation in adults, including monitoring and medications, will be reviewed here. Procedural sedation in children and the sedation required for lengthier procedures, such as colonoscopy, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Procedural sedation involves the use of short-acting analgesic and sedative medications to enable clinicians to perform procedures effectively, while monitoring the patient closely for potential adverse effects. This process was previously (and inappropriately) termed &quot;conscious sedation,&quot; but because effective sedation often alters consciousness, the preferred term is now &quot;procedural sedation and analgesia&quot; (PSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The practice of providing sedation, once primarily the domain of anesthesia practitioners, is now routinely performed by other specialists, such as emergency clinicians, critical care specialists, and various nurse specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Recognizing that PSA exists along a spectrum, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in the United States has attempted to define the levels of sedation, which range from minimal sedation to general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Common terms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesia &ndash; Relief of pain without intentionally producing a sedated state. Altered mental status may occur as a secondary effect of medications administered for analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal sedation &ndash; The patient responds normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, but ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate sedation and analgesia &ndash; The patient responds purposefully to verbal commands alone or when accompanied by light touch. Protective airway reflexes and adequate ventilation are maintained without intervention. Cardiovascular function remains stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep sedation and analgesia &ndash; The patient cannot be easily aroused but responds purposefully to noxious stimulation. Assistance may be needed to ensure the airway is protected and adequate ventilation maintained. Cardiovascular function is usually stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia &ndash; The patient cannot be aroused and often requires assistance to protect the airway and maintain ventilation. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissociative sedation &ndash; Dissociative sedation is a trance-like cataleptic state in which the patient experiences profound analgesia and amnesia but retains airway protective reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is the pharmacologic agent used for procedural sedation that produces this state. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Ketamine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Sedation exists on a continuum, and it is difficult to divide it into discrete clinical stages, the definitions above notwithstanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Moreover, many sedatives can cause rapid changes in the depth of sedation. Dissociative sedation stands apart from the continuum of sedation due to its unique characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute indications for the performance of procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). PSA may be used for any procedure in which a patient's pain or anxiety may be excessive and may impede performance. PSA is often useful for procedures where deep relaxation facilitates performance (eg, closed reduction of a dislocated joint). Common procedures in which PSA may be beneficial include electrical cardioversion, closed joint reduction, complicated laceration repair, abscess incision and drainage, and lumbar puncture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). Relative contraindications may include: older age, significant medical comorbidities, and signs of a difficult airway. Whether the patient recently ate should be considered before performing PSA, although this does not appear to have a major impact on aspiration risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration risk'</a> below.)</p><p>Several factors must be considered before proceeding with PSA. First, the clinician and the patient must agree that the potential benefit of PSA outweighs the risks. Risk depends upon the patient and the procedure.</p><p>There is no specific age above which PSA may not be performed. Nevertheless, the elderly have higher rates of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This may be due to an increased sensitivity to sedative drugs, medication interactions, and higher peak serum levels of administered drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Patients with major comorbid medical conditions are at increased risk for adverse events with PSA. This correlates with an ASA physical status classification of Class III or greater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Important comorbidities are those that increase patient susceptibility to the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of sedatives. They include heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, dehydration, and anemia. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that alternative approaches (eg, monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia in the operating room) are safer for patients at increased risk from PSA.</p><p>To reduce the risk of adverse events in the elderly and patients with major comorbid disease, we suggest a more conservative approach to PSA medications, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving a lower starting dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using slower rates of administration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated dosing of medications at less frequent intervals</p><p/><p>PSA is relatively contraindicated in patients who are likely to be difficult to ventilate or oxygenate should respiratory difficulties arise while the patient is sedated. Alternatives to PSA may be preferable if signs suggesting a difficult airway are identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No data clearly demonstrate that a longer duration of PSA correlates with an increase in adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, common sense suggests that it is preferable to sedate patients for the shortest period necessary to perform the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of gastric contents during anesthesia or PSA is a rare, though much feared complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients undergoing emergency procedures requiring sedation are thought to be at increased risk of aspiration because their stomachs are often full, and the procedure cannot be delayed. Aspiration frequently does not cause harm. However, aspirated gastric contents above a critical volume and acidity can cause severe respiratory and systemic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The importance of fasting for preventing aspiration during PSA remains unclear.</p><p>Guidelines to reduce aspiration risk were put forth in a consensus statement by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These guidelines are based upon expert opinion and to a lesser extent extrapolated from general anesthesia data, in which aspiration with serious consequences is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. The ASA guidelines recommend that patients undergoing PSA for &quot;elective procedures&quot; fast according to the standards used for general anesthesia. This requires that patients not eat or drink for two hours after drinking clear liquids and six hours after ingesting solid foods or cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If these standards cannot be met, the guidelines recommend that the clinician consider delaying the procedure, reducing the level of sedation, or protecting the airway with endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Implementing these guidelines in the emergency department (ED) presents several problems. First, it is rare that patients requiring emergent PSA meet these fasting criteria. Second, emergent procedures cannot be delayed. Finally, although fasting to reduce the risk of aspiration during PSA or elective surgery makes intuitive sense, there is little evidence to support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>].</p><p>According to one review, patients who fast for two hours have the same gastric volume and pH as those who fast for longer periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that a relationship exists among fasting time, gastric volume, gastric pH, depth of sedation, and the likelihood of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/6,12,16,18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,16,18,20,21</a>]. Clinically significant aspiration during emergency department PSA appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Furthermore, endotracheal intubation may not protect the patient from aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/14,18,20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,20,22-24</a>]. Aspiration can occur despite the presence of an endotracheal tube, while the airway manipulation involved in performing intubation appears to increase the risk of aspiration.</p><p>In light of the available literature, the American College of Emergency Physicians policy statement on PSA states: &quot;Recent food intake is not a contraindication for administering procedural sedation and analgesia but should be considered in choosing the timing and target of sedation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We concur and suggest the following approach to reducing aspiration risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of performing the procedure emergently. Although there is no proof that longer fasting times reduce aspiration risk, it is reasonable to wait if the patient's stomach is full and the procedure is not a true emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is particularly true when a potentially difficult airway or an increased risk for aspiration exists, such as with the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conditions predisposing to esophageal reflux (eg, bowel obstruction, hiatal hernia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extremes of age (&lt;6 months or &gt;70 years old)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe systemic disease (ASA class III or greater)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other concerning conditions (eg, depressed mental status)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid deep sedation. No evidence clearly demonstrates that deeper levels of sedation increase the risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Nevertheless, lighter sedation may permit the patient to maintain protective airway reflexes, which reduces risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not suggest administration of pre-procedural antacids or motility agents to reduce aspiration risk. These medications have not been shown to reduce such risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>In some cases it may be best to perform the procedure under general anesthesia in the operating room, although this approach has not been proven to reduce the risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMING PROCEDURAL SEDATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before performing procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), the clinician must discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure and the planned sedation with the patient and answer any questions. A printed informed consent form may be used. Implied consent is acceptable in some cases where the patient is unable to provide explicit consent due to severe pain or altered mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prerequisites and personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although previously the domain of anesthesia practitioners, PSA is performed safely by other clinicians, including emergency and critical care physicians and nurse specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Clinicians providing PSA should have in-depth knowledge of the relevant drugs, including their mechanism of action, doses, side effects, and reversal agents. Such clinicians must also be well versed in advanced cardiovascular life support, including airway management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The number of clinicians needed to perform PSA and the procedure safely may vary according to the patient and the procedure. In most cases, one clinician performs the procedure while another (usually a nurse) administers the sedative agents and monitors and records the patient's vital signs and clinical status. Whenever possible, we suggest that this minimum standard be met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It remains controversial whether an additional clinician, separate from the clinician performing the procedure, who is skilled in deep sedation administration and airway management should be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25</a>]. Guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) call for someone with &quot;advanced life support skills&quot; to be immediately available (within five minutes) for PSA and present in the procedure room whenever deep sedation is being performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Large case series of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> sedation administered by nurses for ambulatory procedures demonstrate that serious adverse events can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, one prospective observational study of over 1000 procedural sedations found that PSA performed by a single emergency clinician (EP) had comparably low complication and high success rates when compared with PSA performed with both an EP and a nurse present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All equipment necessary to perform the procedure and manage the airway should be available at the bedside during the performance of PSA. Such equipment includes suction to manage vomiting or oral secretions, airway adjuncts, such as a bag-valve mask and oral and nasal airways, and equipment to perform endotracheal intubation. Intravenous access should be established. Resuscitation medications, including advanced cardiac life support medications and reversal agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>) should be available. Appropriate monitors should be in place. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and preoxygenation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper monitoring of patients during the performance of PSA is crucial. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate should be measured at frequent, regular intervals; the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) level, and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The patient's response to medications and the procedure must also be closely monitored during PSA. The patient's level of alertness, depth of respiration, and response to painful stimuli (eg, fracture reduction) are all important factors in determining subsequent medication doses. Sedation scales, such as the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and the Ramsay Score, have not been adequately studied in the setting of PSA. They may be more useful in determining the appropriate titration of sedatives during long-term procedures (eg, mechanical ventilation).</p><p>Supplemental oxygen is often recommended during PSA to maintain oxygen reserves and prevent hypoxemia caused by hypoventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there is little evidence to show that this is beneficial and some researchers question the practice.</p><p>The best evidence supporting the use of oxygen is a double blind, randomized trial of adults undergoing PSA with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> in which episodes of hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;93 percent) lasting longer than 15 seconds occurred significantly more often (41 percent) among the 58 patients given compressed air by face mask compared to the 59 patients given high flow oxygen (19 percent) using the same delivery system (difference 23 percent; 95 percent CI 6-38 percent). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, the clinical significance of such transient episodes of hypoxia remains debatable.</p><p>Several observational studies have found that supplemental oxygen at lower concentrations does not reliably prevent hypoxemia during PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and delays the detection of respiratory depression in patients without EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitors, since SpO<sub>2</sub> levels may not fall until a prolonged period of hypoventilation or apnea has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Nevertheless, we suggest that high flow oxygen by face mask be given to patients undergoing PSA because it may reduce the likelihood of hypoxic episodes, particularly with prolonged procedures, is easy to perform, and is highly unlikely to cause harm.</p><p>However, among patients not provided with supplemental oxygen, respiratory difficulty during PSA can manifest earlier as hypoxia, as detected by pulse oximetry, rather than as hypoventilation, as determined by EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitors, according to a small nested randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Therefore, close attention to pulse oximetry readings remains critical when monitoring patients breathing room air during PSA.</p><p>Although evidence is limited, we recommend pulse oximetry and EtCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring for all patients undergoing PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. EtCO<sub>2</sub> measurements correlate closely with arterial CO<sub>2</sub> and provide an early sign of hypoventilation or apnea, especially if supplemental oxygen is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/19,33,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,33,37,38</a>]. EtCO<sub>2</sub> is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While intuitively it makes sense that early detection of hypoxemia and hypoventilation is beneficial, there is no data to suggest that brief episodes of either have a negative impact on patient outcome, especially if recognized quickly and treated appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/25,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,39</a>].</p><p>Bispectral analysis monitoring (BIS), a technology developed to monitor the level of general anesthesia, does not appear to be useful for monitoring the depth of procedural sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].

According to a systematic review of 55 studies including 9652 cases of PSA performed in the emergency department, the rate of severe adverse events requiring an emergency intervention is exceedingly low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Adverse outcomes may include respiratory depression with hypoxia or hypercarbia, cardiovascular instability, vomiting and aspiration, emergence reactions, and inadequate sedation preventing completion of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, significant respiratory compromise, the most concerning potential complication, develops in well less than 1 percent of cases. Among the studies included, the review identified one case of aspiration in 2370 sedations (1.2 per 1000), one case of laryngospasm in 883 sedations (4.2 per 1000), and two intubations in 3636 sedations (1.6 per 1000).</p><p>Multiple studies of pediatric patients have found that PSA is safe, with no deaths reported and few serious consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/28,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,45-47</a>]. One observational case series of 640 patients undergoing PSA reported a 15 percent combined adverse event rate (adverse event and failure to perform procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, factors associated with adverse events included older age, the presence of multiple medical conditions (ie, higher ASA class), and the performance of esophagoscopy or cardioversion.</p><p>Many complications can be prevented through appropriate selection of patients, proper use of sedative medication, and careful monitoring of sedation. Particular attention should be paid to patients in whom oxygenation and ventilation may be difficult, should the need for airway management arise. Such patients may not be appropriate candidates for PSA. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above.)</p><p>Nearly all of the sedative agents used for PSA can cause dose-dependent respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, respiratory complications are the most common adverse events. Oxygen desaturation develops in up to 11 percent of adults who receive PSA with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> and are given supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rates are slightly higher if supplemental oxygen is not used. Oxygen desaturation can be minimized by cautious, unhurried medication administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Hypoventilation and apnea may occur but are usually short-lived due to the brief duration of the drugs used for PSA. These complications nearly always resolve with patient stimulation, supplemental oxygen, positioning of the airway, or brief ventilatory support using a bag-valve mask. Treatment with the reversal agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> may be necessary with more severe or prolonged respiratory depression during PSA using opioids or benzodiazepines. The use of naloxone and flumazenil are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic measures and antidotal therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Antidote (flumazenil)'</a>.)</p><p>Significant hypotension and bradycardia seldom occur but may develop in patients with significant cardiac morbidity and those taking cardiodepressant medications (eg, beta blockers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10,43,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43,48,49</a>]. The problems are usually transient and resolve without intervention. Hemodynamically neutral sedatives (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>) may be preferable for patients at risk from changes in blood pressure or heart rate.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting occur in about 5 percent of patients undergoing PSA, although rates may be higher when opioids are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].

In one randomized trial involving PSA with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, 16 of 127 children managed without antiemetics experienced post-procedural vomiting versus 6 of 128 children pretreated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, a 7.9 percent reduction in absolute risk (95% CI 1.1-14.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) typically involves the intravenous (IV) administration of sedative or dissociative agents, sometimes in combination with short-acting opioids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52744 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Propofol is highly lipophilic and therefore crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly. The drug takes effect within approximately 40 seconds, and its duration of action is approximately six minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,55</a>]. Propofol acts as a sedative and amnestic but provides no analgesia. In addition to its use for PSA, propofol is used for long-term sedation in critically ill patients, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-properties-dosage-regimens-and-adverse-effects#H970645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dosage regimens, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Propofol'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> can induce deep sedation rapidly and must be given with careful attention to dosing and monitoring. For PSA in adults, propofol is given by slow injection in an initial loading dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, followed by doses of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every three to five minutes as necessary until the appropriate level of sedation is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One reasonable approach to administration is to give 20 mg every 10 seconds (eg, a 50 mg dose would be given over 25 seconds), although there is no direct evidence demonstrating improved efficacy or safety using this regimen. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> appear to be unchanged in patients with impaired kidney or liver function. However, plasma levels appear to be increased in elder patients, which can lead to prolonged sedation and more pronounced cardiorespiratory depression. Patients over 55 are particularly sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The manufacturer recommends that doses in elders be reduced by 20 percent and that the drug be given more slowly (over three to five minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Reductions from 20 to 60 percent of the dose used in a healthy young adult are reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Elderly patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> formulation contains egg lecithin and soybean oil, and therefore is contraindicated in patients with a sensitivity to either of these substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Potential side effects include hypotension (due to myocardial depression) and respiratory depression. These side effects generally resolve quickly and uneventfully because of the brief duration of action. However, hypotension can produce complications in patients with severe medical problems (eg, sepsis, cardiac dysfunction) or hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Respiratory depression usually manifests as a mild oxygen desaturation. Coadministration with other sedatives or analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>) can exacerbate respiratory problems. Episodes of hypoxia are generally uneventful and successfully treated with supplemental oxygen and patient stimulation, and less commonly require short periods of assisted ventilation with a bag-valve mask. There are no reports of endotracheal intubation due to propofol-induced respiratory depression during PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> provides <strong>no</strong> analgesia and can cause pain during injection through an intravenous catheter. According to a systematic review of 177 randomized controlled trials involving 25,260 adult patients, the following measures are significantly effective at reducing pain caused by propofol injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injecting into an antecubital vein rather than a hand vein (relative risk [RR] 0.14; 95% CI 0.07-0.30)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> pretreatment while occluding the vein (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.22-0.38)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretreatment with lidocaine-propofol admixture (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.33-0.48)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a> pretreatment without vein occlusion (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.40-0.56)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid pretreatment (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.41-0.59)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> pretreatment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.46-0.57)</p><p/><p>Pain during injection can also be reduced by using larger catheters placed in larger veins.</p><p>Pretreatment with any of several analgesics can reduce the pain caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>.

Unfortunately, the addition of opioids increases the likelihood of respiratory complications. As an example, fentanyl at a dose of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> increases the risk of respiratory depression. To reduce this risk, smaller doses of fentanyl should be used. The best dose to provide adequate analgesia with minimal respiratory risk has yet to be identified. We suggest that no single dose of fentanyl exceed 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> when given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and that the total amount of fentanyl be kept to the minimum required for effective analgesia.</p><p>It may not be necessary to combine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> with a short-acting opioid if the patient's pain is adequately treated prior to the procedure. This approach is supported by an unblinded randomized trial in which patients given PSA consisting of propofol alone had pain levels identical to those treated with both propofol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alfentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alfentanil</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. For both treatment groups, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> was given at least 20 minutes prior to the procedure to all patients experiencing pain until their symptoms were adequately relieved. Of note, patients given both alfentanil and propofol required stimulation to induce respiration more often than those given only propofol.</p><p>Another alternative to pretreatment with short-acting opioids is to use sub-dissociative doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>.

The fall in blood pressure from propofol is generally small and transient, but this difference may be of importance in patients with hypovolemia or hypotension who undergo PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> can cause myoclonus, which appears to reduce the rate of procedural success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/68,69,119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69,119,120</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> causes dose-dependent adrenal suppression, which may be harmful in patients with severe disease (eg, sepsis, multiple trauma).

Myoclonus was more frequent with etomidate (20 versus less than 2 percent with propofol). This likely accounts for the lower rate of procedural success in the etomidate group (89 versus 97 percent).

One small, unblinded randomized trial in adults reported higher rates of subclinical respiratory depression (as determined by changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide [EtCO<sub>2</sub>] or oxygen saturation), longer median times for return to baseline mental status (14 versus 5 minutes), and increased agitation during recovery among patients treated with ketamine for procedural sedation compared to those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].

Suggestions for drug selection in several common scenarios are provided here; contraindications to PSA are reviewed above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52744 \">table 2</a>).

As a result, sedatives administered to older patients for PSA, regardless of the agent, should be given at a lower starting dose with slower rates of administration and less frequent dosing intervals. In elderly patients without major comorbidities or hemodynamic instability, it may be best to perform PSA using an ultrashort-acting sedative, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>.

Some researchers hypothesize that a sub-dissociative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> can provide adequate analgesia without the risk of respiratory depression.</p><p>One small randomized trial found that patients given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> during PSA achieved similar analgesia but experienced fewer complications compared with patients given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV) and propofol, who had five times the risk of experiencing a serious adverse event (eg, hypoxia) (95% CI 1.9-13.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

Some guidelines suggest that patients are ready for discharge when they have reached their &quot;neuromuscular and cognitive pre-procedure baseline&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>Certain conditions should be met before a patient can be considered safe for discharge following PSA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure should be of sufficiently low risk that additional monitoring for complications is unnecessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms, such as pain, lightheadedness, and nausea should be well-controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs and respiratory and cardiac function should be stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status and physical function should have returned to a point where the patient can care for himself or herself with minimal to no assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reliable person who can provide support and supervision should be present at the patient's home for at least a few hours.</p><p/><p>Clear written discharge instructions should be given and explained to the patient and to the family member or friend who will be assisting with the patient's care following PSA. The clinician should explain what was done, the expected course, potential problems, what to do if problems arise, when and where to follow up, and when to return to normal activities.</p><p>One important issue is to determine a period of observation after which adverse events are sufficiently unlikely that even a patient who has not entirely returned to baseline (eg, exhibits mild drowsiness) can be discharged safely. The only study to examine the timing of significant adverse events associated with PSA was performed in a sample of 1341 children and found that 92 percent of such events occurred during the procedure, while only 8 percent occurred afterwards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Significant adverse events rarely occurred more than 25 minutes after the last dose of medication was administered, provided that no adverse events had occurred up to that point. Rarely, episodes of hypoxia developed up to 40 minutes after the last medication dose. In all such cases, prior episodes of hypoxia had occurred.</p><p>Based on these data, some clinicians believe that patients can be safely discharged within 30 minutes of receiving their last dose of sedative provided that no significant adverse events occurred during the procedure and the patient did not receive a reversal agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>). Of note, only relatively long acting agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> were used in this study (ie, neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> were used). It is unlikely that a longer period of observation would be necessary following PSA with ultra-short acting agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although serious adverse events, such as hypoxia, rarely occur after discharge, it is not uncommon for patients to experience mild symptoms, such as nausea, lightheadedness, fatigue, or unsteadiness, for up to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5,124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,124,125</a>]. This should be made clear to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) involves the use of short-acting analgesic and sedative medications to enable clinicians to perform procedures, while monitoring the patient closely for potential adverse effects. This process was previously (and inappropriately) termed &quot;conscious sedation.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSA may be used for any procedure in which a patient's pain or anxiety may be excessive and may impede performance. There are no absolute contraindications to PSA. Relative contraindications include: older age, significant medical comorbidities, and signs of a difficult airway. Whether the patient recently ate should be considered before performing PSA, although this may not increase aspiration risk. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of clinicians needed to perform PSA and the procedure safely may vary according to the patient and the procedure. In most cases, one clinician performs the procedure while another (usually a nurse) administers the sedative agents and monitors and records the patient's vital signs and clinical status. Whenever possible, we suggest that this minimum standard be met. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prerequisites and personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper monitoring during PSA is crucial. The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate should be measured at frequent, regular intervals; oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) level, and cardiac rhythm should be monitored continuously. We suggest that high flow oxygen (15 L by face mask) be provided to patients receiving PSA. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious complications attributable to PSA rarely occur. Significant respiratory compromise develops in less than 1 percent of cases. Adverse outcomes may include respiratory depression with hypoxia or hypercarbia, cardiovascular instability, vomiting and aspiration, and inadequate sedation preventing completion of the procedure. All equipment and medications necessary for airway management should be at the bedside during PSA. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideal drugs for PSA have a rapid onset and short duration of action, maintain hemodynamic stability, and do not cause major side effects. Several medications are commonly used and no single drug is ideal for all situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52744 \">table 2</a>). Medications used for PSA are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSA is most often performed in patients without major comorbidities or hemodynamic instability. In such patients, we suggest that PSA be performed using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> may also be used. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each drug are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Patients without increased risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients are at increased risk of complications during PSA. Therefore, sedatives administered to older patients for PSA, regardless of the agent, should be given using a lower starting dose, slower rates of administration, and less frequent dosing intervals. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Elderly patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some circumstances, clinicians, after carefully considering the relative risks and benefits, may elect to perform PSA in patients at some increased risk of complications. In patients at risk of hypotension, we suggest that either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> be used for PSA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
