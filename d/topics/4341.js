It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adult patients and those with coexisting comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hospital admission rates in the United States for adults with CAP vary widely and are often not directly related to local disease severity, suggesting that clinicians use inconsistent criteria when making the initial decision about the appropriate site of care. In addition, clinicians often overestimate patient risk of short-term mortality, even among low-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A likely consequence of these overestimates is unnecessary admissions; low-risk patients with a physician-estimated risk of death in excess of 5 percent were over six times more likely to be hospitalized after adjusting for other potential confounders of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review focuses on clinical prediction rules and practice guidelines to determine the initial site of treatment for CAP and to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.</p><p>A variety of other important issues related to CAP are discussed separately.

Severity of illness is the most critical factor in making this determination, but other factors should also be taken into account. These include the ability to maintain oral intake, likelihood of medication adherence, history of active substance abuse, mental illness, cognitive or functional impairment, and living or social circumstances (eg, homelessness, residence far enough from a healthcare facility that precludes timely return to care in the event of clinical worsening). Although a definitive etiologic diagnosis is often not established until after the site of treatment decision has been made, clinical or epidemiologic evidence favoring pathogens associated with rapidly progressive forms of pneumonia (eg, post-influenza bacterial pneumonias, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza [eg, H5N1, H7N9], <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia) should be considered and, if deemed likely, warrant hospital admission.</p><p>Our approach for determining the need for admission is based largely upon the severity of illness and is summarized below and in the following algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113076\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113076 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has septic shock or respiratory failure, urgent transfer to a hospital critical care site (ICU or emergency department) is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Admission to intensive care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are practical concerns about outpatient management (such as those outlined above) or the patient's oxygen saturation is &lt;92 percent on room air and represents a significant change from baseline, hospital admission is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H1148992221\" class=\"local\">'Importance of oxygen saturation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the decision for site of care has not been determined based upon the factors above, a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis should be used to supplement, but not replace, physician judgment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the available prediction rules, we prefer the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) because it is the most accurate and its safety and effectiveness in guiding clinical decision making have been empirically confirmed (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia Severity Index'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who are PSI class I or II can be managed as outpatients.

The choice of site of care will depend on each patient's clinical status and other circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H2486270935\" class=\"local\">'Additional options for site of care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who are PSI class IV or V should be admitted to the hospital and ICU admission should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The CURB-65 score is an alternative that can be used when a less complex prediction rule for prognosis is desired (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-curb-65-pneumonia-severity-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), but its safety and effectiveness in guiding the initial site of treatment have not been empirically assessed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'CURB-65 and CRB-65 scores'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 0 can be managed as outpatients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 1 or 2 should generally be admitted to a general medical ward, although patients who receive a score of 1 because they are &ge;65 years of age who do not have major comorbidities do not necessarily require hospital admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 3 to 5 should be admitted to the hospital and ICU admission should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospitalized patients, the clinician should consider whether there are additional markers of illness severity that support higher acuity levels of inpatient care.

We review the quality of these prediction rules for application in emergency department and ambulatory care settings using accepted evaluation standards (ie, relevant patient population, predictors, outcomes, study sites, and design; appropriate modelling techniques used; accuracy of rule assessed; and clinical effects tested) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recommendations related to the use of these prediction rules are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H4138189216\" class=\"local\">'Approach to site of care'</a> above.)</p><p>Overall, 15 prediction rules satisfied 5 or fewer standards for quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/2,4,6-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6-15</a>]. One rule satisfied six standards, although the criterion for determination of accuracy was weakened by the use of just 71 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) satisfied all seven quality standards for prediction rules and was the only one shown to be safe and effective in guiding clinical practice (eighth standard).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumonia Severity Index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PSI was derived and validated as part of the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) prospective cohort study for the purpose of identifying patients with CAP at low risk for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The derivation cohort consisted of 14,199 adults with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal diagnosis of pneumonia in the MedisGroups Comparative Hospital Database. The PSI was validated in a cohort of 38,039 adult inpatients with an ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis of pneumonia in a Pennsylvania statewide database and again in 2287 adult outpatients and inpatients prospectively enrolled from five medical institutions that participated in the Pneumonia PORT prospective cohort study.</p><p>The PSI stratified adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia into five classes for risk of death from all causes within 30 days of presentation. Predictor variables were based upon the medical history, physical examination, and selected laboratory and radiographic findings readily available at the time of patient presentation. In contrast with previous prediction rules, the PSI application uses two steps that parallel decision-making processes the physician usually follows during a patient encounter. Step 1 of the rule identifies patients in the lowest risk class (risk class I) without using laboratory tests based upon the absence of 11 demographic, comorbid conditions, and physical examination findings.</p><p>These factors consist of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;50 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of coexisting conditions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neoplastic disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebrovascular disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of physical examination abnormalities:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altered mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulse <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;125/minute</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;30/minute</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Temperature &lt;35&deg;C or &ge;40&deg;C</p><p/><p>If no Step 1 factors exist, patients are assigned to the lowest severity risk class I; if one or more risk factors are present, the evaluation of illness severity proceeds to Step 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81747 \">table 1</a>). The second step considers laboratory and radiographic information and stratifies the remaining patients into risk classes II, III, IV, or V based upon the total number of points assigned to each risk factor identified. A total point score is computed by adding the patient age in years (years minus 10 for females) and the points for each applicable risk factor. Total scores of 70 or under correspond to class II, 71 to 90 to class III, 91 to 130 to class IV, and over 130 to class V (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). In the derivation and validation of the PSI, any variables with missing information were considered to be normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PSI validation compared risk class&ndash;specific mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All-cause 30-day mortality in risk classes I and II was low (ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 percent in class I and from 0.6 to 0.7 percent in class II); only four (0.3 percent) deaths in the three lowest risk classes were attributable to pneumonia. In contrast, 30-day mortality in risk class V was 27 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59537 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In the initial validation study, increasing risk class was also associated with a higher rate of subsequent hospitalization among those initially treated as outpatients and an increased frequency of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and longer length of stay for inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. None of the 62 outpatients in risk classes I, II, or III who were subsequently hospitalized died, and only one was admitted to the ICU.</p><p>The estimated impact of the rule was assessed using two admission strategies projected for patients in the Pneumonia PORT cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The first strategy proposed outpatient therapy for risk class I or II patients, a brief stay in an observation unit or a short hospital admission for risk class III patients, and traditional inpatient care for patients in risk classes IV and V. This admission guideline would have reduced the rate of traditional inpatient admissions by 31 percent and recommended brief observation for another 19 percent. Among inpatients that would have been recommended for outpatient care under this approach, less than 1 percent died and 4.3 percent were admitted to an ICU. As noted above, risk class III patients can usually be managed as outpatients, as outpatients with home healthcare support, in an emergency department, or in a hospital observation unit. (See <a href=\"#H4138189216\" class=\"local\">'Approach to site of care'</a> above.)</p><p>An additional margin of safety could be provided by following an amended strategy of traditional inpatient therapy for all risk class I, II, and III patients with hypoxemia. The latter approach would still have reduced traditional inpatient care by 26 percent; another 13 percent of inpatients would have been admitted for a brief observational stay. Under this second strategy, mortality among inpatients recommended for outpatient therapy was still less than 1 percent, but the proportion admitted to an ICU was reduced to 1.6 percent. Either admission strategy would have recommended inpatient therapy for five of the six Pneumonia PORT patients who died following an initial course of outpatient therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Effectiveness and safety of the PSI as a decision aid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three randomized trials have examined the effectiveness and safety of using the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) to guide the initial site of treatment for patients diagnosed with CAP in hospital emergency departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings in these trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CAPITAL trial randomized 19 Canadian hospital emergency departments to PSI implementation or usual care study arms. Among the 1743 patients enrolled with CAP, there was an absolute 18 percent decrease in the admission of low risk (risk class I, II, or III) patients in hospitals that implemented the PSI compared with hospitals in the control arm (49 versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, implementation of the PSI had no negative effects on patient quality of life or the occurrence of adverse medical outcomes (ICU admission, mortality, hospital readmission, or complications).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective assessment of the safety of using the PSI rule to guide the initial site of treatment was performed in a randomized efficacy trial that compared outpatient care with hospitalization for CAP in 224 adults in risk class II or III (PSI scores &le;90 points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to outpatient care with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> or hospitalization with intravenous levofloxacin. Exclusion criteria included respiratory failure (PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;60 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> saturation of &le;90 percent), complicated pleural effusion, unstable comorbid illness, severe social, cognitive, or psychiatric impairment, or inability to maintain oral intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The majority of patients in both groups had successful outcomes without complications (84 compared with 81 percent of hospitalized patients). Treatment length, frequency of adverse drug events, and subsequent hospital admissions were similar in the groups. However, outpatients reported significantly greater satisfaction with care than did inpatients (91 versus 79 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Emergency Department Community-Acquired Pneumonia (EDCAP) Trial, conducted at 32 emergency departments in the United States, demonstrated that implementation of an admission guideline based upon the PSI safely increased the proportion of low-risk patients with CAP treated in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this trial, a practice guideline recommending outpatient treatment for 1901 low-risk patients (PSI risk classes I to III) without evidence of arterial oxygen desaturation, was implemented using randomly allocated low (8 sites), moderate (12 sites), and high-intensity (12 sites) guideline implementation strategies. More low-risk patients treated at the moderate (61 percent) and high-intensity implementation sites were treated as outpatients than at the low-intensity (62 versus 38 percent) sites. No differences in safety outcomes (eg, mortality, medical complications, ICU admissions) occurred across the three interventions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this trial, factors independently associated with the hospitalization of low-risk patients were PSI risk classes II or III, the presence of predefined medical or psychosocial contraindication to outpatient treatment, comorbid conditions not contained in the PSI, multilobar chest radiographic infiltrates, and home therapy with oxygen, glucocorticoids, or antibiotics before presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Up to 20 percent of patients had no identified risk factor for hospitalization other than membership in risk class II or III, suggesting that physicians could safely discharge an even greater proportion of low-risk patients than observed in the moderate or high intensity arms of this trial.</p><p/><p>The effectiveness and safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment decision are also supported by two quasi-experimental studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], one controlled observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and a meta-analysis of interventional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All three of the individual studies show that use of the PSI to guide the site of treatment safely increases the proportion of low-risk patients treated as outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In a prospective observational study from France of patients with CAP seen in the emergency department, eight emergency departments used the PSI to determine site of treatment and eight did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis identified six intervention studies guiding the initial site of treatment of low-risk patients with CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All four studies that were clinical trials or prospective interventions with concurrent controls used the PSI to define low-risk patients. This study concluded that such interventions are effective, safe, and acceptable to patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2486270935\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional options for site of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the initial site of treatment is often viewed dichotomously (home versus hospital), treatment intensity can be varied to meet the perceived clinical acuity needs of the patient. As an example, whereas traditional outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics may be appropriate for most low-risk patients with CAP, outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy may be suitable for low-risk patients with intractable nausea or vomiting, poor gastrointestinal absorption, or for those who are less likely to adhere to oral therapy. In-home healthcare support may be an option for PSI risk class II and III patients who are older or have serious comorbid illnesses, abnormal vital signs, or borderline arterial oxygenation levels. Alternatively, such low-risk patients who may have other markers of illness severity and are at high risk for disease progression may benefit from the close monitoring and therapeutic options available during a brief observational stay in the emergency department or hospital followed by discharge upon becoming clinically stable. Although these types of treatment alternatives are likely to vary across medical institutions and coverage may vary by medical insurance companies, each would presumably be more cost-effective than a traditional inpatient stay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1465382938\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations of using the PSI as a decision aid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low risk of mortality is not the only dimension of decision-making for the initial site of treatment, as illustrated in a prospective observational study that examined the natural history of CAP in 586 Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) risk class I and II patients who were hospitalized in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The following factors were independently associated with hospital admission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presentation at a specific inner city hospital</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished premorbid functional status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active substance abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate &ge;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking chills, shortness of breath, nausea, or diarrhea</p><p/><p>Complications were reported in 111 (19 percent) of these low-risk patients. The most frequent complication was the need for urinary catheter insertion (8.5 percent), which was unrelated to the underlying CAP; however, respiratory failure treated by mechanical ventilation occurred in 14 patients (2.4 percent) and empyema in 8 patients (1.4 percent). Five patients (0.9 percent) died.</p><p>This study demonstrates that some patients identified as low risk by the PSI may have medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial contraindications to outpatient therapy. The ability to maintain oral intake, history of substance abuse, cognitive impairment, severe neuromuscular disease, and patient functional status are other factors that may alter decision-making in favor of inpatient therapy. Although a definitive etiologic diagnosis is often not established until after the site of treatment decision has been made, clinical or epidemiologic evidence favoring pathogens associated with rapidly progressive forms of pneumonia (eg, post-influenza bacterial pneumonias, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza [eg, H5N1, H7N9], <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia) should be considered and, if deemed likely, warrant hospital admission. In addition, the rule should not be used for children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, or suspected tuberculosis.</p><p>Because this study did not evaluate clinically important patient exclusion criteria applied in previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it could not directly assess the safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment. In particular, the failure to use arterial hypoxemia as an exclusion criteria (25 percent of their low-risk patients admitted had this condition) and the inclusion of patients meeting clear exclusions from a low-risk population eligible for outpatient treatment (eg, alcoholism, psychiatric illness, homelessness) limit this aspect of the study. This study demonstrates the importance of using such exclusion criteria for outpatient care when using the PSI as a decision aid for the initial site of treatment.</p><p>The PSI rule may oversimplify how physicians interpret some prediction variables. As an example, systolic blood pressures below 90 mmHg are considered abnormal, regardless of the actual value. A systolic blood pressure of 40 mmHg has a markedly different clinical implication than one of 85 mmHg, but the same points would be assigned to both measures.</p><p>A more practical limitation of using this rule is its perceived complexity. Clinicians may consider calculating a score based upon 19 variables, placing patients into risk classes, and selecting an appropriate site for therapy to be too difficult or time consuming. However, this task can be streamlined through the use of a calculator. Integration of the rule into a computerized system that automatically reminds physicians of the rule, computes a point score, and displays the recommended patient disposition could ease this task considerably. A PSI risk calculator can be accessed via the following link (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p>Finally, this prediction rule is intended to supplement rather than override physician judgment. Factors other than the predictors included in the rule may be important when making an admission decision for patients with CAP. In a study of patients evaluated in emergency departments with CAP who were found to be low risk (PSI classes I to III, no arterial oxygen desaturation or psychosocial contraindications to outpatient therapy), outcomes were compared for the 944 who received outpatient treatment and the 549 who were hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mortality at 30 days was higher for inpatients (2.6 versus 1.0 percent), suggesting that physician judgment regarding hospitalization was an appropriate adjunct to the risk stratification score. After propensity score matching for potential confounding factors contributing to site of treatment, mortality was the same for outpatients and inpatients, but outpatients had earlier return to work and activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other applications of the PSI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) may have uses other than for guiding the initial site of treatment. It can be used in studies to adjust for illness severity among patients with CAP, compare patient cohorts, or match clinical sites. Comparisons between predicted and observed 30-day mortality within risk classes for patients presenting with CAP also could be a valuable continuous quality improvement tool for tracking hospital readmissions, mortality, physician performance, or practice patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59537 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">CURB-65 and CRB-65 scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CURB-65 score is based upon five easily measurable factors from which its name is derived (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105316\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105316 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>C</strong>onfusion (based upon a specific mental test or new disorientation to person, place, or time)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>U</strong>rea (blood urea nitrogen in the United States) &gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>espiratory rate &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>B</strong>lood pressure (BP; systolic &lt;90 mmHg or diastolic &le;60 mmHg)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ge;<strong>65</strong> years</p><p/><p>Among the 718 patients (mean age 64) in the derivation cohort of CURB-65, 30-day mortality was 0.7, 2.1, 9.2, 14.5, and 40 percent for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 factors; only a small number of patients had five factors. Similar findings were noted in the separate validation cohort. When the two cohorts were combined, the mortality rate was 0.6 percent with 0 factors (1 of 173 patients) and 1.7 percent with one factor (4 of 241 patients). Although based on a relatively small sample size, the authors suggested that patients with a CURB-65 score of 0 to 1 could probably be treated as outpatients, those with a score of 2 should be admitted to the hospital, and those with a score of 3 or more should be assessed for ICU care, particularly if the score was 4 or 5 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-curb-65-pneumonia-severity-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). In a large independent study of 3181 patients with CAP, mortality was 3.0 percent among 901 patients with a CURB-65 score of 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The mortality rate within this CURB-65 risk group is similar to that observed for PSI class III patients; although some of these patients can be safely managed as outpatients, others may warrant brief emergency department or hospital observation or brief inpatient hospitalization. We generally favor hospital admission for patients with a CURB-65 score of 1, although patients with a score of 1 due to being &ge;65 years of age who do not have major comorbidities do not necessarily require admission. If a less complex prediction rule is desired, the CURB-65 is an alternative to the PSI, but its effectiveness and safety in guiding the initial site of treatment has never been empirically assessed.</p><p>A simplified version (CRB-65), which does not require testing for blood urea nitrogen, is sometimes used for decision-making in primary care practitioner's offices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In this version, admission to the hospital is recommended if one or more points are present. A study of 670 patients from Germany found good utility from the CRB-65 score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Overall, the PSI classified 68 percent of the patients as low risk, more than the CURB (51 percent) or the CURB-65 (61 percent). Aggregate 30-day mortality rates were slightly lower for low-risk patients identified by the PSI, but the performance of the system did not differ from the other two tools.

More than 75 percent of patients were over 50 years old.

A subsequent population-based cohort study showed that oxygen saturations &lt;92 percent may represent a more appropriate threshold to guide the initial site of treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among 2923 patients with pneumonia who presented to the emergency department but who were discharged to be treated as outpatients, those with oxygen saturations &lt;90 percent had significantly higher rates of 30-day mortality (6 versus 1 percent), hospitalization (18 versus 7 percent), and the composite endpoint of either 30-day mortality or hospitalization (21 versus 8 percent) compared with patients with oxygen saturations &gt;90 percent. Blood oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent was independently associated with 30-day mortality or hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8). If the oxygen saturation threshold was increased to 92 percent, there was no association with adverse events; such a change in threshold would have entailed one additional hospitalization for every 14 patients discharged. These findings suggest that using a blood oxygen saturation of &lt;92 percent would be a safer threshold for hospital admission than a threshold of &lt;90 percent. These thresholds for arterial hypoxemia are most applicable to patients without underlying pulmonary disease who have evidence of new arterial desaturation on room air associated with their pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">NURSING HOME RESIDENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower respiratory tract infections are common among residents of nursing homes and one of the most frequent reasons for transferring residents to a hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

For these reasons, investigators in Canada designed and evaluated a clinical pathway for treating residents with respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in the nursing home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-assessing-severity-and-determining-the-appropriate-site-of-care/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Twenty-two nursing homes were randomly assigned to use of a clinical pathway or usual care in treatment of lower respiratory infections, and a total of 680 nursing home residents &ge;65 years were enrolled in the study.</p><p>The presence of two or more symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection (eg, new or increased cough, new or increased sputum production, temperature &gt;38&ordm;C, pleuritic chest pain, or new or increased abnormal findings on chest examination) and a new or increased infiltrate on chest radiograph defined pneumonia. Study nurses assessed patients and provided care in the nursing home in those who met all of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Able to eat and drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse &le;100 beats per minute</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate &le;30 per minute</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure &ge;90 mmHg or a decrease of &le;20 mmHg from baseline if &lt;100 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen saturation &ge;92 percent or if the resident had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease &ge;90 percent</p><p/><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated by the clinical pathway were less likely to be hospitalized (10 versus 22 percent hospitalized in the usual care group).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in mortality rate (8 versus 9 percent), health-related quality life, or functional status between the clinical pathway versus usual care groups, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical pathway resulted in an overall cost savings of USD $1016 per resident treated.</p><p/><p>This study had several limitations. First, only 36 percent of the study population had radiographically confirmed pneumonia, considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing CAP. Second, enrolled patients were from nursing homes with &ge;100 beds, decreasing the generalizability to patients from smaller nursing homes. Finally, although this intervention was successfully implemented in a single-payer healthcare system (Canada), it may be more difficult to implement in a multiple-payer system (eg, the United States).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143778746\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4063445\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital admission rates in the United States for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) vary by a factor of three and are often not directly related to local disease severity, suggesting that clinicians use inconsistent criteria when making the initial decision about the appropriate site of care. In addition, clinicians often overestimate patient risk of short-term mortality in low-risk patients, often resulting in inappropriate hospitalizations. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of whether a patient with CAP can be safely treated as an outpatient or requires hospitalization is essential before making subsequent decisions about diagnostic testing or therapy. Severity of illness is the most critical factor in making this determination, but other factors should also be taken into account (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113076\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113076 \">algorithm 1</a>). These include the ability to maintain oral intake, likelihood of medication adherence, history of active substance abuse, mental illness, cognitive or functional impairment, living or social circumstances (eg, homelessness, residence far enough from a healthcare facility that precludes timely return to care in the event of clinical worsening), and clues about select microbiology pathogens. (See <a href=\"#H4138189216\" class=\"local\">'Approach to site of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has septic shock or respiratory failure, urgent transfer to a hospital critical care site (intensive care unit [ICU] or emergency department) is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Admission to intensive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are practical concerns about outpatient management (such as those outlined above) or evidence of arterial hypoxemia (oxygen saturation is &lt;92 percent on room air), hospital admission is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H1148992221\" class=\"local\">'Importance of oxygen saturation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the decision for site of care has not been determined based upon the factors above, a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis should be used to supplement physician judgment. (See <a href=\"#H4138189216\" class=\"local\">'Approach to site of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the available prediction rules, we prefer the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) because it is the most accurate and its safety and effectiveness in guiding clinical decision-making have been empirically confirmed in multiple studies (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-community-acquired-pneumonia-severity-index-psi-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia Severity Index'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who are PSI class I or II can be managed as outpatients. Some PSI class II patients may benefit from in-home healthcare support, also termed &quot;hospital-at-home,&quot; (eg, a visiting nurse, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who are PSI class III can usually be managed as outpatients, as outpatients with in-home healthcare support, or with a brief observational stay in an emergency department or inpatient observation unit. The choice of site of care will depend on each patient's clinical status and other circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients who are PSI class IV or V should be admitted to the hospital and ICU admission should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The CURB-65 score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-curb-65-pneumonia-severity-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) is an alternative that can be used when a less complex prediction rule for prognosis is desired, but its safety and effectiveness in guiding the initial site of treatment have not been empirically assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 0 can be managed as outpatients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 1 or 2 should generally be admitted to a general medical ward, although patients who receive a score of 1 because they are &ge;65 years of age who do not have major comorbidities do not necessarily require hospital admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with a CURB-65 score of 3 to 5 should be admitted to the hospital and ICU admission should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospitalized patients, the clinician should consider whether there are additional markers of illness severity that support higher acuity levels of inpatient care. Patients with &ge;3 Infectious Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA)/American</span> Thoracic Society (ATS) minor severity criteria often warrant admission to a higher acuity level of inpatient care, including the ICU.
