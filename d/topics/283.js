This relatively common change is mediated at least in part by the reversible podocyte foot process fusion, which is apparent by electron microscopy, and which is characteristic of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. In addition to this modest reduction in GFR, some patients with MCD develop acute kidney injury (AKI), which is often severe and may require dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In most cases, AKI is due to acute tubular necrosis.</p><p>The pathophysiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of GFR reduction in patients with MCD are discussed in this topic. The pathophysiology and treatment of edema in such patients, as well as treatment of MCD in children and adults, are presented elsewhere.

Studies of children with this disorder show a close correlation of the GFR with both the reduced filtration fraction and the decreased serum albumin concentration that are proportional to the severity of the nephrotic state. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6-8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,10</a>]. Filtrate that has passed through the glomerular basement membrane enters the urinary space via the slit pores between the adjacent foot processes. Foot process fusion decreases the filtration slit frequency, thereby increasing the average path length for filtration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10</a>]. The capacity of the glomerular basement membrane to bar the egress of serum albumin into Bowman's space is altered, causing massive proteinuria, while foot process fusion reduces the glomerular capillary wall permeability to water and small solutes, decreasing hydraulic permeability and explaining the reduction in the GFR.</p><p>Low effective arterial blood volume is <strong>not</strong> the cause of reduced GFR in most patients with MCD. Although patients with MCD have a low plasma oncotic pressure, the &quot;underfill&quot; hypothesis that was thought to explain the reduction in GFR and the intense renal sodium reabsorption is no longer accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-32</a>]. Rather, in this particular edematous state, an increase in the interstitial pressure is accompanied by an increase of the lymph flow to the circulation that maintains a normal blood volume. These changes in renal function regress with treatment-induced remission of proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some patients with MCD (usually adults), an acute onset of a severe decline in GFR is seen, possibly requiring dialysis. As noted below, hypertension and older age are risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with MCD. In several studies, for example, kidney biopsies performed in patients with MCD and AKI revealed vascular lesions of arterial and arteriolar sclerosis, which are commonly found in hypertensives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,33</a>]. These lesions of the renal vessels contribute to reduced blood flow to the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], which diminish in number with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, tubulointerstitial lesions are common with hypertensive nephrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Underlying vascular disease and tubulointerstitial lesions may be an important precursor to the development of AKI in patients with MCD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010627289\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY, ETIOLOGY, AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many adults and children with minimal change disease (MCD) have a modest, persistent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as evidenced by a moderate elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration. However, despite normal glomeruli by light microscopy, some patients with MCD develop acute kidney injury (AKI), which is often severe and may require dialysis. </p><p>The simultaneous presence of AKI and nephrotic syndrome should raise suspicion for MCD, particularly among older adults. In one large series, for example, 5 of 20 patients biopsied because of AKI and nephrotic syndrome had a diagnosis of MCD; two had pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, and no other etiology of nephrotic syndrome accounted for more than one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The likelihood of MCD is even higher in nephrotic patients with acute tubular necrosis as the cause of AKI (15 of 19 in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4236554833\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury in adults with minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI has been reported in approximately 25 to 35 percent of adults with MCD and is frequently present at the time the nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12,14,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,38,39</a>]. Patients with MCD who develop AKI are more likely than those who do not develop AKI to be older, male, hypertensive, and to have more severe nephrotic syndrome. As an example, in one retrospective review of 95 adults with MCD from the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], AKI occurred in 24 patients (25 percent). In 17 patients, it was concurrent with the initial presentation of MCD, and in seven patients, it occurred during a relapse of MCD. Patients with AKI were older (54 versus 42 years) and were more likely to be male (63 versus 33 percent) and hypertensive (69 versus 37 percent). In addition, proteinuria was higher among those with AKI (13 versus 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. </p><p>Most patients presenting with AKI in the setting of MCD have substantial proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. In a large series of 75 adults with MCD who developed AKI, the mean urine protein excretion was 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and the serum albumin was 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (19 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately one-half of patients had hypertension at the time of presentation, and 84 percent had massive edema. All cases of AKI occurred within three months of the time that the nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed (mean of 29 days). AKI was severe; most patients were oliguric at presentation, and approximately 20 percent required dialysis or died from uremia. </p><p>The usual etiologies of AKI in adults with MCD are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute tubular necrosis</strong> &ndash; Most reported patients appear to have tubular changes that are similar to those in postischemic acute tubular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12-14,33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,33,38</a>]. In the study of 75 adults with MCD and AKI mentioned above, acute tubular necrosis was the cause of AKI in 65 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. By contrast, tubular injury is not seen in renal biopsies of patients with MCD who maintain relatively normal renal function. These observations suggest that transient ischemia may occur early in the course of the disease. Older patients who develop this complication also tend to have underlying arteriolar nephrosclerosis, which might predispose to decreased nephron perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong> &ndash; NSAIDs can diminish renal function by decreasing the formation of vasodilator prostaglandins, thereby inducing renal vasoconstriction; this may induce ischemic tubular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. NSAIDs may also cause MCD as a toxic effect of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. The latter complication is most often seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fenoprofen</a> and is typically accompanied by an acute interstitial nephritis that is responsible for the renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contrast-induced nephropathy</strong> &ndash; Nephrotic patients, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, are especially prone to AKI following iodinated contrast media-enhanced radiographic procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excessive diuresis</strong> &ndash; Natriuresis induced by loop diuretics can lead to plasma volume depletion and a decline in renal function. This problem is most likely to occur in patients with a plasma albumin concentration of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In most patients, however, the hypoalbuminemia is less severe. In addition, edema and renal sodium retention in MCD are primarily due to a direct effect of glomerular albumin leak on the renal tubules, rather than a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure and, consequently, reduced effective arterial blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16,17,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,26-31</a>]. Thus, such patients are generally at low risk of hypovolemia following fluid removal with diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe renal interstitial edema</strong> &ndash; In one report, it was hypothesized that severe interstitial edema, named nephrosarca, can lead to tubular collapse and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, most authorities do not believe that nephrosarca is a cause of AKI in patients with MCD. In fact, pathology reports on kidney biopsies from patients with MCD often point to renal interstitial edema but do not mention significant tubular collapse. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased urine viscosity</strong> &ndash; In nephrotic patients with oliguria and an unusually high degree of proteinuria, urine viscosity may contribute to impair renal function. This is illustrated by a case in which a patient with AKI voided small amounts of gel-like urine with &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Renal function recovered with a glucocorticoid-induced remission of proteinuria. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2334950701\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury in children with minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI is much less frequent in children with MCD as compared with adults. In one study of 1006 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, the nine-year incidence of AKI was 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As noted above, about 25 to 35 percent of adults with MCD develop AKI. (See <a href=\"#H4236554833\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury in adults with minimal change disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Conversely, AKI is common when children with MCD are hospitalized for complications of nephrotic syndrome, such as infection or thrombosis. As an example, in a multicenter study of 336 children with nephrotic syndrome, 197 developed AKI (59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Common causes of AKI in these children include hypovolemia (due to diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive diuresis), infection (typically, pneumonia or peritonitis), nephrotoxic medications (such as NSAIDs), and the effects of drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/51-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-59</a>].</p><p>Changes in glomerular permeability may underlie AKI in some children. In one study of 11 children with MCD and oliguric AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], for example, measured renal plasma flow at presentation was normal, and neither renal plasma flow nor filtration fraction improved after volume expansion with 20 percent albumin. This indicated that decreased renal perfusion was not contributing to the reduction in GFR. Rather, these findings are consistent with a principal role for reduced glomerular capillary loops permeability due to foot process fusion in the pathogenesis of the reduced GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-aki-in-minimal-change-disease-and-other-forms-of-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3036600659\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury in other forms of nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI is unusual in other pure nephrotic states (ie, patients with a normal or near-normal urine sediment) such as diabetic nephropathy and amyloidosis. </p><p>There are, however, two major settings in which AKI can occur in pure nephrotic syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with the collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in which renal insufficiency is due both to glomerular and concurrent tubular injury. This disorder is often associated with HIV infection but may occur in the absence of this infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not associated with HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some patients treated with NSAIDs. These drugs reduce the GFR and may induce an acute functional renal impairment that is reversible after stopping the medication. Conversely, NSAIDs may cause an acute allergic interstitial nephritis, which regresses slowly following treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, although patients with interstitial nephritis do not have a normal urine sediment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other, less common causes of AKI in conjunction with nephrotic syndrome include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to drugs that are commonly used in treatment of nephrotic syndrome (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, thiazide diuretics, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) may occasionally produce AKI due to a hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis. Skin rash and eosinophilia may accompany these reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AKI due to crescentic glomerulonephritis has rarely been described in patients with membranous nephropathy. In this setting, the urinalysis reveals an active sediment (red cells and granular and cellular casts) rather than a bland urine sediment as seen in most patients with AKI associated with nephrotic syndrome.

For unknown reasons, renal vein thrombosis is more frequent in membranous nephropathy than in other nephrotic states. However, most patients with this complication have relatively stable renal function; an elevation in the plasma creatinine concentration primarily occurs in the exceptional patient with acute bilateral renal vein thrombosis that produces renal infarction and flank pain before the development of a collateral venous circulation relieves the intrarenal venous pressure.

In addition, volume replacement is appropriate in patients who have developed a decline in renal function that is temporally related to diuretic-induced fluid removal.

Foot process fusion decreases the filtration slit frequency, thereby increasing the average path length for filtration. The capacity of the glomerular basement membrane to bar the egress of serum albumin into Bowman's space is altered, causing massive proteinuria, while foot process fusion reduces the glomerular capillary wall permeability to water and small solutes, decreasing hydraulic permeability and explaining the reduction in the GFR. Low effective arterial blood volume is <strong>not</strong> the cause of reduced GFR in most patients with MCD. (See <a href=\"#H3345421990\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2010627289\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology, etiology, and clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some patients with MCD (usually adults), an acute onset of a severe decline in GFR is seen, possibly requiring dialysis. Hypertension and older age are risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with MCD. The simultaneous presence of AKI and nephrotic syndrome should raise suspicion for MCD, particularly among older adults. (See <a href=\"#H3345421990\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2010627289\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology, etiology, and clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients presenting with AKI in the setting of MCD have substantial proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema.

Conversely, AKI is common when children with MCD are hospitalized for complications of nephrotic syndrome, such as infection or thrombosis. Common causes of AKI in these children include hypovolemia (due to diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive diuresis), infection (typically, pneumonia or peritonitis), nephrotoxic medications (such as NSAIDs), and the effects of drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
