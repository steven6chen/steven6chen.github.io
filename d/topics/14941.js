Reentry, which occurs when a propagating impulse fails to die out after normal activation of the heart and persists to re-excite the heart after the refractory period has ended, is the electrophysiologic mechanism responsible for the majority of clinically important arrhythmias. Included among these arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry, AV reentry involving a bypass tract, ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction (MI) with the presence of left ventricular scar, and ventricular fibrillation. </p><p>The first demonstration of reentry in its simplest form (ie, the ring model) probably occurred in 1906 following the application of a stimulus to tissue from a jellyfish which initiated rhythmic contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, reentry was first conceived as a mechanism for arrhythmias in 1913 when it was recognized that reentrant tachycardias arise from circular electrical pathways, often initiated by a blocked impulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It was subsequently realized that reentry tachycardias may also be due to other mechanisms, including functional or leading circle circuits and abnormal electrical circuits caused by diseased myocardium.</p><p>The definition and characteristics of the different reentry circuits responsible for the most clinically significant arrhythmias are presented here, along with the electrophysiologic properties of these arrhythmias. The clinical presentation and management of the individual arrhythmias are discussed separately.

The one event crucial to the development of a reentrant tachycardia is the failure of a group of fibers to activate during a depolarization wave. The initiation of a reentrant arrhythmia also requires the presence of myocardial tissue with the following electrophysiologic properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjacent tissue or pathways must have different electrophysiologic properties (conduction and refractoriness) and be joined proximally and distally, forming a circuit. These circuits may be fixed or stationary or may move within the myocardial substrate (as occurs with spiral waves).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each involved pathway of the circuit must be capable of conducting an impulse in an <strong>antegrade and retrograde direction</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient or permanent <strong>unidirectional block</strong> must exist as a result of heterogeneity of electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium. This event usually results when one electrical pathway has either a prolonged refractory period or a prolonged repolarization time, producing a wave which only travels down the remaining pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conduction velocity in the normal unblocked pathway must be <strong>slow</strong> enough relative to the refractoriness of the blocked pathway to allow recovery of the previously blocked pathway. The impulse can then be conducted through the previously blocked but recovered pathway in a retrograde direction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrograde conduction in this previously blocked pathway must be slow enough to allow the normal pathway to recover, and again be capable of being excited.</p><p/><p>A sustained reentrant arrhythmia will occur if these conditions are present and maintained.</p><p>Patients who develop reentrant arrhythmias usually have an anatomic or electrical (functional) abnormality, which could be caused by an accessory pathway, by an abnormal separation of adjacent fibers that may form two limbs of a reentrant circuit, or by juxtaposed fibers that possess different electrophysiologic characteristics, often resulting from abnormalities of the myocardium and Purkinje fibers as the result of a disease process. Susceptible patients with appropriate underlying abnormalities usually do not suffer from incessant tachycardia because the different electrophysiologic mechanisms required for the initiation and maintenance of a reentrant tachycardia are infrequently present at exactly the same time. </p><p>However, changes in heart rate or autonomic tone, ischemia, electrolyte or pH abnormalities, or the occurrence of a premature beat (which results in transient changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium) may be sufficient to initiate a reentrant tachycardia. In fact, premature depolarizations frequently initiate these tachyarrhythmias when there are appropriate electrophysiologic conditions (ie, slow conduction and unidirectional block). They are associated with more rapid depolarization (as they are early or premature) that may block in one pathway (ie, unidirectional block), conduct through the second pathway, retrogradely enter the first pathway, and then reenter the second pathway. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial criteria for the diagnosis of reentry proposed in the early 20th century are still valid, but are often difficult to prove [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, the following twelve conditions in the electrophysiology laboratory were proposed to either prove or to identify the existence of a reentrant tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the myocardium mapped in one direction around a continuous loop.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correlation of continuous electrical activity occurring when the tachycardia develops.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correlation of unidirectional block with initiation of reentry.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation and termination by premature stimulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dependence of initiation of the arrhythmia on the site of pacing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inverse relationship between the coupling interval of the initiating premature beat and the interval to the first tachycardia beat.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resetting of the tachycardia by a premature beat with an inverse relationship between the coupling interval of the premature beat and the cycle length of the first or return beat of the tachycardia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fusion between a premature beat and the tachycardia beat followed by resetting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient entrainment (with external overdrive pacing, the ability to enter the reentrant circuit and &quot;capture&quot; the circuit, resulting in a tachycardia at the pacing rate and having fused or paced complexes).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt termination by premature stimulation or the termination of entrainment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dependence of initiation on a critical slowing of conduction in the circuit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarity with experimental models in which reentry is proven and is the only mechanism of tachycardia.</p><p/><p>The segment of the reentrant circuit that is, at any given time, no longer refractory and is capable of being excited is called the excitable gap&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Slowing of impulse conduction or shortening of refractoriness will increase the excitable gap. The longer the excitable gap, the more likely it is for an extrastimulus to enter the reentrant circuit and initiate or terminate a reentrant arrhythmia. In addition, entrainment is more likely to occur when the excitable gap is longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REENTRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reentry tachycardias have been divided into two different forms based upon the type of anatomic substrate used for the development of the arrhythmia: anatomic or functional. The original ring model requires the presence of an anatomic obstruction (due to a structural abnormality). There are also several models of functional reentry (due to electrophysiologic abnormalities) including the leading circle, anisotropic conduction, figure of eight, and spiral wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54711 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic reentrant tachycardia most closely resembles the original description of reentry arrhythmia because it requires an anatomic obstacle, such as an area of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This discrete anatomic block creates a surrounding circular pathway, resulting in a fixed length and location of the reentrant circuit. A tachycardia is initiated when a depolarization wave splits into two limbs after going around this obstacle, creating a circus movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Tachycardia rates are determined both by the wavelength (defined as conduction velocity and refractory period) and the length of the circuit or the pathlength.</p><p>Examples of anatomic reentry are supraventricular tachycardia associated with an accessory pathway (preexcitation syndromes), AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, typical atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating within the His-Purkinje system (bundle branch tachycardia), and VT originating at the terminal portion of the His-Purkinje system or around an area of infarcted tissue (scar mediated). There is often a long excitable gap associated with anatomic reentry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional reentry depends upon the intrinsic heterogeneity of the electrophysiologic properties of cardiac muscle (ie, dispersion of excitability or refractoriness) as well as anisotropic differences in intercellular resistances. There is no anatomic obstacle present. Examples of functional reentry include atypical atrial flutter, some cases of atrial fibrillation (AF), and VT in a structurally normal heart.</p><p>Functional circuits have the following properties:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They tend to be small, rapidly conducting, and unstable in that the waves they generate may fragment, establishing other areas of reentry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circuit times and hence tachycardia rates are significantly dependent upon the refractory period of the involved tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location and size of these tachycardias vary due to the absence of an anatomic block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is usually a short excitable gap associated with functional reentry.</p><p/><p>One animal study reported the following additional properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thin layer of activation near the core or central region of the circuit is responsible for the maintenance of reentry; the remaining portion of the tissue is activated passively by the outward propagation of wavefronts away from the core.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to the tissue near the core is essential for termination of reentry by a point stimulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To terminate reentry with a stimulus applied away from the core, the stimulus must occur at certain critical coupling intervals and the line connecting the stimulus and the core must be roughly parallel to the fiber orientation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Leading circle concept</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this model, functional reentry involves the propagation of an impulse around a functionally determined region of unexcitable tissue or a refractory core and among neighboring fibers with different electrophysiologic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The excitation wave then travels in the smallest possible circuit with the head of the impulse having just enough strength to excite relatively refractory tissue ahead of it. Thus, the &quot;head of the circulating wavefront is continuously biting its tail of refractoriness&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>There is a small excitable gap in this setting. The circulating wave activates peripheral tissue but also gives rise to wavelets that collide at the center, rendering it refractory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anisotropic reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anisotropic reentry is determined by the orientation of myocardial fibers and the manner in which these fibers and muscle bundles are connected to each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In general, the electrical resistances between cells is dependent upon fiber orientation (ie, cell-to-cell communication is more rapid between cell that are parallel to each other), while communication is slower when cells are transverse to each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Anisotropic reentry occurs in myocardium composed of tissue with structural features different from those of adjacent tissue, resulting in variations in conduction velocities and repolarization properties (referred to as anisotropic myocardium) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54711 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, an impulse propagating parallel to the long axis of the myocardial tissue will typically travel three to five times faster than the same impulse traveling in the transverse direction. Therefore, anatomic anisotropy can cause heterogeneity of electrophysiologic properties which can result in blocked impulses and slowed conduction, thereby setting the stage for reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Figure of eight reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This model of reentry involves two counter rotating circuits around a center that is anatomically damaged, but is common to both circuits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The reentrant beat produces a wavefront that circulates in both directions around a long line of functional conduction block and rejoins on the distal side of the block. This results in two concomitant circuits, forming a &quot;figure of eight.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Spiral wave (rotor) activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this model of reentry, there are concentric circular waves that result in reverberators or rotating vortices of electrical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Spiral waves, which typically describe reentry in two dimensions, can be initiated in an inhomogeneous, excitable medium whenever there is disruption of the wavefront. Spiral waves rotate around an organizing center or core, which includes cells with a transmembrane potential that has a reduced amplitude, duration and rate of depolarization (ie, slow upstroke velocity of phase 0); these cells are potentially excitable, but remain unexcited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Anisotropy and anatomic obstacles can modify the characteristics and spatiotemporal behavior of the spiral. In addition, the spiral waves may give rise to daughter spirals which can result in disorganized electrical activity; this may be the mechanism for ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Spirals may be stationary (the possible mechanism for monomorphic VT), or may continuously drift or migrate away from their origin (possibly the mechanism for polymorphic VT or AF), or may be anchored, initially drifting and then becoming stationary by anchoring to a small obstacle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56857\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56857 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase two reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase 2 reentry is a phenomenon largely related to Brugada syndrome and is discussed separately.

Thus, electrophysiologic studies reveal atrial activation and conduction that is identical to sinus rhythm, with the earliest recorded atrial activation in the reentrant tachycardia being located near the sinus node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>As with any reentrant arrhythmia, SA nodal reentrant tachycardia is usually initiated by a premature atrial stimulus, but also rarely by a ventricular premature stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. It is clinically and electrocardiographically difficult to distinguish this arrhythmia from sinus tachycardia. Both have identical P waves at a rate that is usually less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The abrupt onset and termination of the reentrant arrhythmia is the only clinical distinction from sinus tachycardia which has an onset and termination that is gradual and not abrupt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76364\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76364 \">waveform 2</a>).

Coarse AF, which is usually seen when the AF is more recent in onset, is thought to be caused by a relatively small number of large sized waves, while fine fibrillation (when usually indicated AF that has been present for a longer period of time) is caused by many small, fragmented waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73958%7ECARD%2F53988\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73958 graphicRef53988 \">waveform 3A-B</a>).

It is the result of dual AV nodal pathways, both of which conduct in an antegrade and retrograde direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. The slow or alpha pathway typically has a slower conduction velocity and shorter refractory period (faster recovery) than the faster conducting beta pathway, which has a faster conduction velocity but a longer refractory period. These two pathways are linked proximally and distally within the AV junction.</p><p>AV nodal reentrant tachycardias (AVNRT) have been divided into two types based upon their mechanism of conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

If the impulse reaches the distal end of the circuit when the fast pathway has recovered, it enters the fast pathway and is conducted in a retrograde direction to activate the atrial in a retrograde direction and simultaneously with ventricular activation. If the slow pathway has recovered by the time the impulse reaches the proximally portion of the circuit, the impulse may also reenter the slow pathway. If this situation repeats, an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia results. As ventricular activation is via the slow pathway and retrograde atrial activation is via the fast pathway, this is termed &quot;slow-fast&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54290\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54290 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uncommon type of AVNRT uses the fast pathway in an antegrade manner and the slow pathway in the retrograde manner (fast-slow) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66828\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66828 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56806 \">figure 8</a>). This may be initiated by a premature ventricular beat that is blocked in the fast pathway and hence travels up to the atrial via the slow pathway and then down to the ventricles via the fast pathway (fast-slow).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrioventricular reentry using an accessory bypass tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of an accessory bypass tract, which has electrophysiologic properties that are different from those of the normal AV node-His Purkinje system and resemble the properties of Purkinje fibers, favors the development of reentrant tachycardia by providing two limbs of a possible reentrant circuit: one limb is the AV node and His-Purkinje system; and the other is the bypass tract which directly connects an atrium and a ventricle, bypassing the AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The circuit, known as a macroreentrant circuit, is formed by a proximal connection via the atria and a distal connection within the ventricular myocardium. Accessory bypass tracts can be found along the perimeter of both the mitral and tricuspid valves or within the ventricular myocardium (bundle of Kent), may connect the atrium directly to the distal AV node or His Purkinje system (bundle of James), and may also connect the AV node to either the right bundle or the ventricle, termed nodofascicular and nodoventricular tracts, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Accessory bypass tracts may conduct reentrant impulses either in a retrograde or antegrade direction. Orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is defined by conduction of the depolarization impulse to the ventricles down the AV node and His-Purkinje system in an antegrade manner and its return via the accessory tract in a retrograde manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68804\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68804 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71302 \">figure 9</a>). The QRS complex is narrow (although it may have a typical right or left bundle branch block pattern if there is aberration) as ventricular activation is via the normal conduction pathway. Antidromic AVRT is characterized by the reverse sequence in which the depolarization wave travels down the bypass tract in an antegrade direction to activate the ventricular myocardium and returns to the atria via the His-Purkinje system and AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54484\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54484 \">waveform 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50433 \">figure 10</a>). In this situation, the QRS complex is maximally preexcited and has a wide and strange morphology as a result of direct myocardial activation via the accessory pathway. The complex is the same as the preexcited complex during sinus rhythm, although it may be wider as it is maximally preexcited. Orthodromic AVRT is most common, occurring in approximately 90 percent of symptomatic patients with accessory bypass tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; antidromic AVRT accounts for the remaining 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The conduction characteristics of bypass tracts can vary significantly not only among patients, but also between retrograde and antegrade directions within the same tract in a given patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As an example, a single bypass tract may be involved in both orthodromic and antidromic AVRTs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT; monomorphic) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), the two most lethal arrhythmias, are both caused by reentry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63176\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63176 \">waveform 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80454\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80454 \">waveform 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Ischemia, infarction, and the resulting fibrosis most often produce the cardiac substrate necessary for reentrant ventricular arrhythmias: areas of unidirectional block and sufficiently slow conduction. The reentrant circuits are small, involving the distal Purkinje fibers within normal and abnormal myocardial tissue, and this has been termed &quot;microreentry.&quot; Monomorphic VT can be initiated by appropriately timed premature ventricular impulses or by burst pacing and can be terminated by cardioversion, overdrive pacing, or antiarrhythmic drugs. VF can be initiated by appropriately timed premature ventricular impulses but can be terminated only with defibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ventricular-tachycardia-and-ventricular-fibrillation-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although sustained VTs with different QRS morphologies (polymorphic VT) occur spontaneously or during electrophysiologic study after a myocardial infarction, they most commonly arise from reentrant circuits located in the region of the infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Factors responsible for different exit routes from circuits in the same region, leading to multiple morphologies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different direction of rotation around the same circuit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small differences in the reentrant circuit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentrant circuits with different sizes and shapes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in the refractoriness of the ventricular myocardium and hence its ability to conduct the impulse</p><p/><p>While sustained VT generally involves one reentrant circuit, or perhaps a single spiral, VF results from multiple circuits simultaneously activating the ventricular myocardium. In an animal model, the most likely underlying mechanism was rotating spiral waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. With the development of global ischemia during VF, the rate of VF decreases due to an increase in the rotation period of the spiral waves that results from an increase in the core area.</p><p>It has frequently been observed that VF is often preceded by a variable period of VT. The transition from a sustained organized VT to disorganized VF probably involves the breakup of a single propagating wave or spiral into multiple daughter wavelets or spirals, a result of heterogeneity of myocardial electrophysiologic properties (functional block) or anatomic obstacles. This is identical to the process seen with AF. These wavelets rarely reenter themselves but can re-excite portions of the myocardium recently activated by another wavefront, a process called random reentry. As a result, there are multiple wavefronts of activation that may collide with each other, extinguishing themselves or creating new wavelets or spiral and wavefronts, thereby perpetuating the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Spontaneous wave breaks without apparent collision may also occur during VF; in an experimental model, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> can reduce the incidence of these events, decreasing the number of wavelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Spontaneously occurring reentrant arrhythmias are infrequent in a healthy ventricle, because the substrate for reentry is lacking. However, these tachyarrhythmias can occur in a normal heart in the right clinical setting. As an example, bundle branch reentry can be initiated by an early coupled premature impulse; VT may then develop based upon the difference in the refractory periods either between the two bundles or between one of the bundles and ventricular muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75164 \">figure 11</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bundle-branch-reentrant-ventricular-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bundle branch reentrant ventricular tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>VF can also be induced in a healthy heart if a properly timed, strong stimulus is applied to the ventricle. The critical moment occurs immediately after the refractory period, generally at the downstroke of the T wave just after its peak, a period of time termed the vulnerable period, when a heterogeneous state of excitability and refractoriness exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A strong stimulus applied during the vulnerable period is postulated to set up a number of functional reentrant circuits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6660791\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias are generally produced by one of three mechanisms: enhanced automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry. Reentry, which occurs when a propagating impulse fails to die out after normal activation of the heart and persists to re-excite the heart after the refractory period has ended, is the electrophysiologic mechanism responsible for the majority of clinically important arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the one event which is crucial to the development of a reentrant tachycardia is the failure of a group of fibers to activate during a depolarization wave, the initiation of a reentrant arrhythmia also requires various electrophysiologic properties (eg, ability to conduct antegrade and retrograde, presence of unidirectional block, etc) to be present concurrently within the myocardial tissue making up the circuit. Changes in heart rate or autonomic tone, ischemia, electrolyte or pH abnormalities, or the occurrence of a premature beat (which results in transient changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium) may be sufficient to initiate a reentrant tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twelve conditions which may be seen during invasive electrophysiology study in the electrophysiology laboratory have been proposed to either prove or to identify the existence of a reentrant tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry tachycardias have been divided into two different forms based upon the type of anatomic substrate used for the development of the arrhythmia: anatomic or functional. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anatomic reentrant tachycardia requires a discrete anatomic obstacle, such as an area of fibrosis, resulting in a fixed length and location of the reentrant circuit. Examples of anatomic reentry are supraventricular tachycardia associated with an accessory pathway (preexcitation syndromes), AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia originating within the His-Purkinje system (bundle branch tachycardia), and ventricular tachycardia originating at the terminal portion of the His-Purkinje system or around an area of infarcted tissue. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic reentry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Functional reentry depends upon the intrinsic heterogeneity of the electrophysiologic properties of cardiac muscle (ie, dispersion of excitability or refractoriness) as well as anisotropic differences in intercellular resistances. There is no anatomic obstacle present. Examples of functional reentry include type II (atypical) atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Mayer AG.
