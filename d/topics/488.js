Central vision is required for activities such as driving, reading, watching television, and performing activities of daily living.</p><p>AMD is classified as dry (atrophic) or wet (neovascular or exudative) for clinical purposes. Different classifications and grading schemes have been used in epidemiologic and therapeutic studies of AMD. Many epidemiologic studies make a distinction between age-related maculopathy (ARM) and AMD. All wet lesions are AMD, but early dry lesions that do not reduce vision may be classified as ARM rather than AMD. A further source of confusion is that AMD is often abbreviated as ARMD.</p><p>Dry AMD progresses to wet AMD in some patients. The risk of developing wet AMD in people with bilateral early dry AMD (bilateral soft drusen) was estimated at 1.0 to 4.7 percent at one year and 13 to 18 percent at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry AMD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early lesions are more common than later-stage disease in dry AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Findings in dry AMD may include subretinal drusen deposits, focal or more widespread geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), pigment epithelial detachments, and subretinal pigment epithelial clumping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70148\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70148 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80193\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80193 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drusen are localized deposits of extracellular material, usually concentrated in the macula, and appear as small, bright-yellow objects on ophthalmoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58340 \">picture 2</a>). Drusen can be hard, soft, or crystalline and calcific. Larger soft drusen are associated with vision loss. The risk of progression to advanced AMD increases with the size and number of soft drusen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A few small, hard drusen are detectable in almost all people over 50 years of age and are a normal consequence of aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hard drusen are not associated with significantly increased risk of advanced macular degeneration and its complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal and geographic areas of RPE atrophy appear as AMD progresses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79129\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79129 \">picture 3</a>). These areas represent thinning and loss of tissue in a focal or more geographic pattern in the macula. Depending upon the location of the RPE atrophy, central vision or pericentral vision may be affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advanced dry AMD, also referred to as geographic atrophy, is characterized by cell death in adjacent areas of the RPE and photoreceptors. It accounts for about 10 percent of legal blindness related to AMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Wet AMD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding of either large soft drusen or RPE pigmentary clumping increases the risk of wet AMD. Wet AMD is characterized by growth of abnormal vessels into the subretinal space, usually from the choroidal circulation and less frequently from the retinal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Although wet AMD is found in only 10 to 15 percent of patients with AMD, wet AMD accounts for more than 80 percent of cases with severe visual loss or legal blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast to dry AMD, in which vision loss is slow and gradual, wet AMD is characterized by rapid distortion and loss of central vision over a period of weeks to months. The contralateral eye is at high risk of developing neovascularization, with a cumulative incidence estimated at 10, 28, and 42 percent at one, three, and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Wet AMD can be subcategorized, based upon the pattern of choroidal neovascularization seen on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography, into classic, occult, or fibrous lesions.
