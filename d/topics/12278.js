They are typically classified by etiology and location. Most abdominal wall hernias should be repaired when identified; however, there are exceptions (eg, parastomal hernia). The nature of the repair depends upon the size of the hernia and the location on the abdominal wall in which it has occurred.</p><p>An overview of the classification, clinical features, and treatment options for most abdominal wall hernias will be reviewed here.

Groin hernias include inguinal and femoral hernias. Groin hernias are subclassified according to anatomic factors.

These are reviewed separately for the more common types of hernias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults#H606339779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia#H617250177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation of abdominal wall hernias can vary depending upon location. Small hernias can be asymptomatic or present with varying degrees of pain and discomfort as the hernia contents protrude through the abdominal wall defect. Most often, the patient will complain of a bulge somewhere in the abdominal wall. Coughing or straining may aggravate any pain or discomfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66840 \">figure 2</a>). Large ventral hernias can cause excessive pressure leading to areas of ischemia and ulceration which can be seen on the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53985\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53985 \">image 1</a>). </p><p>A Richter's type hernia is a particular type of abdominal wall hernia for which only part of the circumference of the bowel becomes incarcerated in the hernia defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88742\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88742 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A Richter's type hernia can form anywhere a defect is large enough for the bowel to enter, but small enough to prevent protrusion of an entire loop of bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common site is in the femoral canal, where it can be easily mistaken for an enlarged lymph node. These hernias can also develop at laparoscopic port sites. The diagnosis of a Richter's hernia can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Focal strangulation of a portion of the bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58994 \">figure 3</a>) can progress to ischemia and gangrene, with or without overt signs of intestinal obstruction. Patients may present initially with only local inflammation at the site of the hernia. Richter's type hernia can also present in a delayed fashion as an enterocutaneous fistula.</p><p>Although any abdominal wall hernia can present with complications due to incarceration of intestinal contents in the defect, abdominal wall hernias such as femoral, obturator and sciatic hernias frequently go unrecognized until they present as bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;, section on 'Incarceration and strangulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical colorectal obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21329162\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal wall should be examined with the patient both standing and lying down. On examination, the hernia may be easy to identify, and if palpable, the edges of the fascial defect can often be defined. Supine examination will often allow the size of the hernia defect to be determined. The entire abdominal wall, particularly along the length of any incisions, should be palpated carefully to identify all coexistent hernia sites. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21327110\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ventral and groin hernias can be readily identified with a thorough abdominal and groin examination, but there is a subset of patients with very small hernias that are hidden in the abdominal fat planes. These are best characterized using imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; epigastric, spigelian, groin, incisional, lumbar, umbilical</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography &ndash; lumbar, obturator, perineal, sciatic</p><p/><p>In the obese patient with a suspected incisional hernia that cannot be confirmed on examination, abdominal CT is the best imaging study to confirm a diagnosis of abdominal wall hernia and identify the contents contained within the hernia sac. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21327129\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although any intra-abdominal pathology that can cause abdominal pain and discomfort, most will be accompanied by elements of the history and other symptoms and signs. The differential of acute abdominal pain and chronic abdominal wall pain is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal wall masses that could mimic strangulated abdominal wall hernia include abdominal wall hematoma and abdominal wall tumors. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal wall hematoma generally occurs in the presence of antithrombotic therapy with or without instrumentation (eg, paracentesis). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desmoid tumors, which can arise from the abdominal muscular aponeurosis are characterized by slow growth and minimal pain, and are associated with a different risk profile. Likewise, abdominal wall sarcomas can similarly present as an abdominal wall mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and local therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Diastasis recti is rarely confused for abdominal wall hernia. The rectus muscles are normally fused at the midline with no more than 1 to 2 mm separating them. Diastasis recti is an acquired condition in which the rectus muscles are separated by an abnormal distance along their length, but with no fascial defect. A separation &gt;2 mm is considered to be a diastasis recti (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69049 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52358 \">figure 1</a>). It is most commonly found in middle-aged and older men with central obesity, or small women who have carried a large fetus or twins to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Incisional hernias are found in the presence of an obvious surgical incision. Congenital or acquired midline hernias of the abdominal wall are confined to the umbilicus or the epigastrium. Epigastric hernias are generally &le;2 cm in diameter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21327184\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC HERNIA SITES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21328626\"><span class=\"h2\">Epigastric hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epigastric hernias are defects in the abdominal midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52358 \">figure 1</a>). The defects are often no more than 1 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72710\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72710 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Epigastric hernias are likely the result of multiple factors, including congenitally weakened linea alba from a lack of decussating midline fibers, increases in intra-abdominal pressure, muscle weakness, or chronic abdominal wall strain. The frequency of epigastric hernia is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the general population and is more common in males (male:female = 3:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. </p><p>Epigastric hernia can be asymptomatic, but many times patients will note a small, slightly uncomfortable lump between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. Up to 20 percent of epigastric hernias are multiple. Bowel incarceration or strangulation is rare. Epigastric hernias that involve a peritoneal sac usually contain only omentum, and only rarely small intestine. Laparoscopically, these hernias can be difficult to identify due to the lack of peritoneal protrusion through the hernia defect. </p><p>Repair of the epigastric hernia is reserved for symptomatic patients, and most often can be performed as a day-surgery procedure under local anesthesia. A small midline or transverse incision is made overlying the hernia. The hernia contents are either reduced or resected, and the defect is closed with interrupted sutures. Recurrence is uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21328400\"><span class=\"h2\">Incisional hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incisional hernias, by definition, develop at sites where an incision has been made for some prior abdominal procedure. The epidemiology, risk factors, and management of incisional hernia are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is estimated that an incisional hernia will develop in approximately 10 to 15 percent of abdominal incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and in up to 23 percent of patients who develop postoperative wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Any condition that inhibits natural wound healing will make a patient susceptible to the development of an incisional hernia. Such conditions include: infection, obesity, smoking, medications such as immunosuppressives, excessive wound tension, malnutrition, fractured sutures, poor technique, and connective tissue disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Emergency surgery increases the risk of incisional hernia formation. Abdominal wound dehiscence, in particular, leads to incisional hernia. Risk factors for the development of wound dehiscence include age &gt;70 years, male gender, chronic pulmonary disease, ascites, jaundice, anemia, emergency surgery, coughing, type of surgery, and wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;, section on 'Fascial dehiscence'</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative ventral hernias have been described following paramedian, subcostal, McBurney, Pfannenstiel, and flank incisions. Laparoscopic port sites may also develop hernia defects in the abdominal wall fascia. The highest incidence is seen with midline incision, the most common incision for many abdominal procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Upper abdominal incisions have a higher incidence of herniation than do lower abdominal incisions. A small, randomized trial comparing vertical and transverse incisions for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair found, at four-year follow-up, that incisional hernia was significantly more likely to occur with vertical laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Incisional hernias typically develop in the early postoperative period, suggesting that local factors (infection, tension, technique) are responsible. However, hernias can develop as late as 10 years after surgery; these may arise from previously undetected small hernias. Incisional hernias can increase in size to enormous proportions; giant ventral hernias can contain a significant amount of small or large bowel. At the extreme end of the spectrum is the giant incisional hernia that leads to loss of abdominal domain, which occurs when the intra-abdominal contents can no longer lie within the abdominal cavity.</p><p>The patient with an incisional hernia complains of a bulge in the abdominal wall, originating deep to the skin scar. This may cause a varying degree of discomfort, or may present as a cosmetic concern. Symptoms are usually aggravated by coughing or straining, as the hernia contents protrude through the abdominal wall defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66840 \">figure 2</a>). Presentation of the incisional hernia with incarceration causing bowel obstruction is not uncommon. In large ventral hernias, the skin may present with ischemic or pressure necrosis leading to frank ulceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53985\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53985 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The hernia, on examination, is usually easy to identify, and the edges of the fascial defect can often be defined by palpation. The entire abdominal wall, along the length of the incision, should be inspected and palpated carefully, as multiple hernias are often present in the setting of an incisional hernia. These are frequently referred to as &quot;swiss cheese hernias&quot; because of their appearance. In the obese patient with a suspected incisional hernia that cannot be confirmed on examination, computed tomography of the abdomen is the best test to visualize intra-abdominal contents within the hernia sac. (See <a href=\"#H21327110\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Most incisional hernias should be repaired. Surgery should be considered when any of the following factors are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms attributable to the hernia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential for bowel incarceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sufficient size to complicate dressing or activities of daily living</p><p/><p>Even the smallest incisional hernia has the potential for incarceration and, thus, repair should be considered. Hernias that are less likely to incarcerate include upper abdominal hernias, hernias less than one cm in diameter, and hernias larger than 7 to 8 cm (where loops of bowel can move in and out of the hernia sac without restriction, and are therefore less likely to become incarcerated).</p><p>Contraindications to elective surgery are only those conditions that preclude any elective surgical procedure in the unstable or high-risk patient due to comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119628902\"><span class=\"h2\">Inguinal and femoral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Groin hernias, including inguinal and femoral hernias, are the most common abdominal wall hernias. Issues related to these types of hernias are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Lumbar hernias arise in one of two possible triangular defects in the lumbar region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81616 \">figure 6</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior lumbar triangle (Grynfeltt) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65959\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65959 \">image 3</a>) is an inverted triangle, its base is the twelfth rib, its posterior border is the erector spinae, and its anterior border is the posterior margin of the external oblique; its apex is at the iliac crest inferiorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inferior triangle (Petit) is located between the external oblique, the latissimus dorsi, and the iliac crest caudally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71107\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71107 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p>Lumbar hernias can be congenital or spontaneous, but most lumbar hernias are related to prior surgery, most typically urologic surgery such as partial or complete nephrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76449\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76449 \">image 5</a>). Denervation of the nerves from urologic surgical approaches can aggravate an inherent weakness in the lumbar area. The apparent hernia can be an area of diastasis, in which the muscular aponeurosis has been weakened. Traumatic injuries can also exacerbate inherent weaknesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The most common presentation of a lumbar hernia is a palpable posterolateral mass that increases in size with coughing and strenuous activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mass is usually reducible, and disappears when the patient assumes a decubitus position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Lumbar hernias can also present as vague back pain, bowel obstruction, urinary obstruction, pelvic mass, or, rarely, as a retroperitoneal or gluteal abscess. </p><p>Repairs can be performed laparoscopically or via an open approach. Invariably, repair requires the use of mesh. The mesh can be placed deep to the muscular wall if the procedure is performed anteriorly through an open approach or adjacent to the defect if the hernia is repaired laparoscopically. This repair can lead to chronic postoperative pain related to the difficulty in fixing mesh to the costal margin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3466054\"><span class=\"h2\">Obturator hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obturator hernias are a rare type of abdominal wall hernia in which the abdominal contents protrude through the obturator foramen. Weakening of the obturator membrane may result in enlargement of the canal with a defect that is usually anterior and medial to the obturator neurovascular bundle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Factors that increase intra-abdominal pressure are implicated as risk factors. They are more commonly right sided, but can be bilateral. These are much more common in women, usually in the setting of profound weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A pilot tag or properitoneal fat precedes the development of a hernia sac. The hernia sac usually contains small bowel, but may contain large bowel, omentum, fallopian tube, or appendix. In &gt;90 percent of cases, the diagnosis is made intraoperatively during exploration for bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It can also present as obturator neuralgia (groin pain radiating medially to the knee) due to compression of the obturator nerve, palpable proximal thigh mass (between pectineus and adductor longus muscles), or ecchymosis of the thigh if bowel necrosis has occurred. Obturator hernias may be initially confused as femoral hernias, but can also occur in conjunction with femoral hernia. Nonstrangulated obturator hernias can be repaired using mesh via a posterior preperitoneal approach (open or laparoscopic), which provides direct access to the hernia. Reduction of the hernia may require incision of the obturator membrane. When strangulation is suspected, an abdominal approach is used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21328908\"><span class=\"h2\">Parastomal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a stoma (ileostomy, colostomy) are at risk for hernia formation due to creation of a defect in the abdominal wall through which the bowel is brought when constructing the stoma.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection#H492677\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of perineal complications following an abdominal perineal resection&quot;, section on 'Perineal hernia'</a>.)</p><p>Primary perineal hernias most commonly occur in older, multiparous women. Clinically, they present as a unilateral bulge in the area of the labia, perineal regions, or gluteal regions. They are classified as anterior or posterior based upon the position relative to the transverse perinei muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The hernia may be detected on bimanual rectal-vaginal examination and can be confirmed on ultrasound or pelvic computed tomography (CT). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1157210022\"><span class=\"h2\">Sciatic hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sciatic hernias pass through either the greater sciatic foramen above (suprapiriform hernia) or below (infrapiriform hernia) the pyriformis muscle, or through the lesser sciatic foramen (spinotuberous hernia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53186\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53186 \">figure 7</a>). These hernias are rare. Conditions that may predispose to sciatic hernia include coexisting hernia, malignancy, pelvic abnormalities (eg, congenital, posttraumatic), and pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one review, the contents of the hernia sac were (in order of frequency) ovary, ureter, small intestine, colon, neoplasm, omentum, or bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>These unusual hernias may present as a buttock mass, with abdominal pain, or as sciatica. Intestinal obstruction, urinary sepsis due to herniation of the ureter, and gluteal sepsis have also been reported. A definitive diagnosis can be made with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p>Repair consists of reduction of the hernia contents and closure of the defect with or without prosthetic material, and can be accomplished using an abdominal approach (typically laparoscopic) for strangulated hernias, a transgluteal approach (nonstrangulated), or a combined approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21328992\"><span class=\"h2\">Spigelian hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Spigelian hernia occurs along the semilunar line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55169\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55169 \">figure 8</a>), which is the caudal most extent of the posterior rectus sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This anatomic location is weak because of the absence of a posterior sheath behind the rectus muscle. Spigelian hernia is well described, but relatively rare. It is likely that these hernias will become more frequently diagnosed, as they are readily seen on computed tomography scans as well as laparoscopic views of the anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>As the hernia develops, preperitoneal fat emerges through the defect in the Spigelian fascia, bringing an extension of the peritoneum with it through the fascia. The hernia is nevertheless covered by the intact external oblique aponeurosis. For this reason, almost all Spigelian hernias are interparietal in nature, and only rarely will the hernia sac lie in the subcutaneous tissues anterior to the external oblique fascia. The hernia cannot develop medially due to resistance from the intact rectus muscle and sheath. Therefore, a large Spigelian hernia is most often found lateral and inferior to its defect in the space directly posterior to the external oblique muscle.</p><p>Accurate diagnosis of Spigelian hernias by physical examination is quite challenging. The patient most often presents with a swelling in the mid to lower abdomen, just lateral to the rectus muscle. The patient may complain of a sharp pain or tenderness at this site. The hernia is usually reducible in the supine position. The reducible mass may be palpable, even if it is below the external oblique musculature. Up to 20 percent of Spigelian hernias will present incarcerated.</p><p>Ultrasound is the most reliable and easiest imaging modality to assist in the diagnostic workup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Even if the hernia is fully reduced during examination and no mass is palpable, ultrasound can show a break in the echogenic shadow of the semilunar line associated with the fascial defect. Ultrasound can also identify the nonreduced hernia sac passing through the defect in the Spigelian fascia. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen will also confirm the presence of a Spigelian hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The anatomy of the Spigelian hernia should make it readily apparent on laparoscopic evaluation of the anterior abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68967\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68967 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63214\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63214 \">image 7</a>).</p><p>Given the frequency of bowel obstruction, repair is generally recommended once the hernia is diagnosed. Surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia. A transverse incision is made directly over the palpable mass or fascial defect. A hernia in the subcutaneous space will be immediately obvious, whereas an interparietal hernia will require deeper dissection. The external oblique muscle is split to identify the sac posterior to it. The sac is isolated, opened, and the contents reduced. The sac can be excised or inverted depending upon its size. The defect is closed by suturing the medial and lateral edges of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis aponeuroses, which approximates the internal oblique and transverses fascia laterally to the rectus sheath medially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although the use of mesh plugs to close the hernia defect has been described, prosthetic mesh is not required for this repair. Laparoscopic repair has also been performed successfully, following previously described techniques for incisional hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Recurrence is uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21328517\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital umbilical hernias in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the umbilicus and management of umbilical disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, umbilical hernias are more often acquired and are associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, abdominal distension, ascites, and pregnancy. They occur more commonly in females than in males with a 3 to 1 ratio. In men, umbilical hernias most often present incarcerated, whereas females, particularly those close to their ideal body weight, are more likely to have an easily reducible mass. Typically, omentum or preperitoneal fat is contained within the hernia sac. Omental strangulation within a hernia can cause chronic abdominal wall pain. On the other hand, if a knuckle of bowel becomes incarcerated (Richter's hernia), bowel obstruction or bowel ischemia can develop.</p><p>The diagnosis of umbilical hernia is usually made with palpation of a soft mass at the umbilicus, which may be asymmetric, located slightly above, slightly below, or to one side or another (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72970\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72970 \">picture 1</a>). Tenderness can be elicited with pressure and palpation, but is often not present without provocation. </p><p>Certain umbilical hernias may be so small and asymptomatic that the patient is not even aware that a hernia is present. These hernias do not require repair and can be observed. The treatment of symptomatic umbilical hernias is surgical, either as an open repair through a skin incision, typically for small hernias, or laparoscopically for large hernias. For open repair, a vertical or curvilinear incision can be made overlying or adjacent the hernia sac, identifying the hernia sac and dissecting it to its fascial attachments. Once the fascia has been cleared, the hernia sac can either be inverted or excised, and the fascia subsequently closed with a nonabsorbable suture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53945 \">figure 9</a>). If the defect is large, and the fascial edges cannot be approximated without tension, mesh should be used. The mesh should be placed deep to the fascia (sublay technique) and sutured circumferentially to the surrounding umbilical fascia to prevent migration. A variety of flat meshes and mesh plugs are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An effort should be made to tack the skin of the umbilicus to the fascia to recreate a cosmetically appealing umbilicus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

They are typically classified by region of the abdominal wall and etiology. (See <a href=\"#H21326829\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although abdominal wall hernias can go unnoticed, patients will usually complain of a bulge that may or may not be associated with other symptoms, most often localized pain. However, abdominal wall hernia can present with complications related to incarceration and strangulation of contents in the hernia sac. Large ventral hernias may present with skin ulceration due to pressure necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H786595\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of suspected abdominal wall hernia can usually be made with physical examination. For patients in whom abdominal wall hernia is suspected but not apparent clinically, we suggest further imaging, the nature of which depends upon the location of the suspected hernia.
