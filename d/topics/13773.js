It is thought to result from a selective loss of inhibitory nitrinergic neurons (which contain nitric oxide synthase) in the myenteric plexus, resulting in relatively unopposed excitation by the cholinergic system. Clinical symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, regurgitation, heartburn, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed by esophageal manometry.</p><p>There is no cure for achalasia. Treatment is focused on palliating symptoms by decreasing LES pressure to facilitate emptying of esophageal contents. This can be accomplished by mechanical disruption of the muscle fibers of the LES (eg, with pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy) or by biochemical reduction in LES pressure (eg, with injection of botulinum toxin). For patients at low surgical risk, treatment aimed at mechanical disruption of the LES is generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the advantages and disadvantages of pneumatic dilatation and botulinum toxin injection for the management of achalasia. The pathophysiology, etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and surgical therapy of achalasia are discussed separately.

A number of different balloon dilators have been used (eg, Mosher bag, Sippy dilators, Brown-McHardy dilator, Rider-Moeller dilator), but most are no longer being manufactured. At present, the most popular pneumatic dilator in the United States is the Rigiflex balloon.</p><p>The Rigiflex balloon is passed over a guidewire and positioned using fluoroscopy across the LES. The balloon is available in three different diameters (3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 cm). The smallest balloon is typically used for the first dilation. If symptoms persist, the procedure can be repeated with incrementally larger balloons (the so-called &quot;graded approach&quot;).</p><p>The standard approach to balloon dilation is one dilation per session, with additional dilations being performed if symptoms persist or return. Patients are usually referred to surgery if three consecutive dilations do not provide symptom resolution.</p><p>More recently, dilation has been performed using a hydraulic balloon dilation catheter (EsoFlip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The EsoFlip is a 7F, 230 cm long catheter with an 8 cm tapered nylon balloon with a maximal diameter of 30 mm. The catheter can be advanced alongside the endoscope over a guidewire for direct visualization. In a pilot study with 10 patients, dilation was technically feasible without complications. The one-week response rate was 90 percent, while the three-month response rate dropped to 70 percent. Larger long-term studies need to better evaluate the efficacy of hydraulic balloon dilation in the treatment of achalasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique for PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is advised to fast for at least 12 hours prior to the procedure. A liquid diet should be prescribed for one or two days preceding the dilation in patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of severe food retention within the esophagus.</p><p>There is no consensus on the optimal method for performing PD. Reported protocols have varied widely with regard to the types of dilators used, the maximum diameter of the balloon (2.4 to 5.0 cm), the pressure to which the balloon is inflated (100 to &gt;1000 mmHg), the rate of balloon inflation (rapid versus gradual), the duration of balloon inflation (several seconds to five minutes), and the number of balloon inflations per dilating session (one to five) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. None of the variations in technique has led to significant changes in outcome.</p><p>We use the Rigiflex balloon for PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A 3 cm balloon is used for the initial dilation in most adults. Prior to the procedure, the balloon is inflated and checked for leaks or deformities.</p><p>Prior to dilation, a thorough endoscopic examination is performed, with particular attention given to the cardia, where malignancy can simulate achalasia (called pseudoachalasia). A guidewire is then passed through the biopsy channel of the endoscope into the stomach and the scope is withdrawn to the gastroesophageal junction. The distance between the incisors and the gastroesophageal junction should be noted using the markings along the length of the scope.</p><p>The endoscope is then removed, taking care to maintain the position of the guidewire in the stomach. To aid with initial balloon placement, a marker (such as paper tape) can be placed on the shaft of the dilating catheter corresponding to the previously noted distance between the incisors and the gastroesophageal junction. This distance should be measured from the middle of the balloon on the dilating catheter so that, when inserted, the middle of the balloon will be positioned across the LES.</p><p>The balloon and tip of the catheter are lubricated and passed over the previously placed guidewire until the marker reaches the incisors. Using fluoroscopy, the balloon is then gradually inflated with air, noting the position of the developing &quot;waist&quot; in the balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66408\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66408 \">image 1</a>). Small adjustments usually have to be made in the position (deflating the balloon each time) to ensure that the waist occurs at the center of the balloon (this is critical for both efficacy and safety). We often inject a small volume of dilute contrast into the balloon to assist in radiographic visualization.</p><p>Because patients may be extremely uncomfortable during balloon inflation, we find it useful to administer a dose of an opiate one to two minutes before the balloon is inflated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After a satisfactory position is obtained, the balloon is fully inflated so that the waist is obliterated, taking note of the pressure within the balloon using an external gauge. In our experience, approximately 7 to 15 pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure is required for waist obliteration, which usually requires approximately 120 mL of air.</p><p>Inflation is maintained for 60 seconds, after which, the balloon is rapidly deflated. We then perform a second full inflation for 60 seconds and again note the pressure required to obliterate the waist. This is usually at least 3 psi less than the initial pressure.</p><p>After the second inflation, the deflated balloon and guidewire are removed and the patient is transferred to the recovery area. The patient is observed for five to six hours since serious complications, such as perforation, will usually become clinically apparent within this time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The patient is subsequently discharged if the recovery was uneventful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 71 to 90 percent of patients respond initially to PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>], but many patients subsequently relapse. Although retrospective analyses of PD outcomes suggest good to excellent sustained responses in approximately two-thirds of patients, prospective studies suggest a less favorable prognosis, with more than 50 percent of patients relapsing over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. One-third to one-half of patients treated with PD will require at least one additional dilation, and a subset of these patients will require surgery.</p><p>Five-year follow-up results from the European achalasia study identified the following factors as predictors of failure following pneumatic dilation: age &lt;40 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.2, p = 0.02), pre-existing daily chest pain (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.9 to 6.5, p = 0.07), and a width of the esophagus of &lt;4&#8197;cm before treatment (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.9 to 8.6, p = 0.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the investigators also identified risk factors for the need for redilation: age &lt;40 years, esophageal diameter of 4 cm, and type III (spastic achalasia) manometric pattern. Esophageal stasis after treatment by contrast was not a risk factor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1015728645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'High-resolution manometry'</a>.) </p><p>PD may not be equally effective for relieving all symptoms of achalasia. In one report, for example, PD had little effect on chest pain, which is present in approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients with achalasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study, chest pain continued after PD in approximately half of the patients who initially complained of this symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H34211525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Short- to medium-term results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short- to medium-term results have been described in both retrospective and prospective studies. Retrospective studies are limited because patients for whom treatment was unsuccessful may have been lost to follow-up or referred elsewhere. In addition, many patients who continue to be symptomatic do not seek medical attention (38 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Data from prospective reports are generally more reliable. Small (7 to 29 patients) prospective studies of PD using Rigiflex balloons reported success rates of 53 to 93 percent, but most had less than two years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Two larger prospective studies of approximately 50 patients each with longer follow-up had less favorable results with a remission rate of 26 to 40 percent after four years or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, a prospective study of 77 patients had better results, with 70 percent of patients in remission after a median of 5.6 years of follow-up (range 3 to 10.7 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], as did two randomized trials in which patients treated with PD had remission rates of 84 to 90 percent after 3.5 to 5 years of follow-up (though in one of the trials, 25 percent of patients required repeat dilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>PD has also been studied in children with achalasia. In a prospective study of 24 children with achalasia who were followed for a median of six years (range two to seven years), the overall success rate following PD (up to three sessions) was 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Older children were more likely to respond to PD than younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term (&gt;10 year) results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achalasia is a chronic disease and patients may need to be followed for more than a decade to judge the success of treatment. However, few studies have addressed the outcome of PD after 10 years or more. Complete symptom resolution has been described in some patients followed for as long as 10 to 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/10,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28,29</a>]. However, data are conflicting with respect to the likelihood of maintenance of long-term remission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 153 patients found that, after five years, 76 percent of patients reported good to excellent symptom outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of the 35 patients with 15 or more years of follow-up, 18 (51 percent) reported good or excellent outcomes by the end of follow-up. The median time to symptom recurrence in this study was 11 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective report of 126 patients, 115 (91 percent) improved after one to three sessions of PD. The median dysphagia-free duration was 60 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study, 54 consecutive patients were followed every two years for a period of 10 years, with a mean follow-up of 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The remission rate at five years after a single PD was 40 percent. Among the 21 patients in remission at five years, 18 remained in remission for an additional 10 years. Thus, patients whose symptoms were well controlled for five years were likely to continue to do well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study included 228 patients who had an initial response to PD (defined as being symptom free at 12 months following the first PD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. During follow-up, the estimated relapse-free survival rates were 18 percent by 2 years, 41 percent by 5 years, and 60 percent by 10 years. During follow-up, additional treatments (PDs, myotomy, botulinum toxin injections) were performed in 34 percent of 163 patients for whom data were available. Overall, after a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, the long-term success rate was 71 percent (68 percent for those who had no additional treatment, 79 percent for those who had interval PD, and 77 percent for those who received other interval treatments).</p><p/><p>The value of repeated dilations after the first relapse has been difficult to evaluate objectively. In a prospective study of 54 patients cited above, only 35 percent of patients who received three dilations were in remission after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, a retrospective study of 150 patients suggested that repeated dilations may help improve long-term remission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In that study, 137 patients (91 percent) went into remission. Among the 25 patients who attained remission after one session of PD and did not undergo repeat PD, 67 percent were in remission at five years and 50 percent at 10 years. By contrast, the 112 patients who received repeated dilations as needed for recurrent symptoms (an &quot;on-demand&quot; approach) had remission rates of over 90 percent at 10 years. Apart from the retrospective nature of this study, the higher response rate may also have been due to an older patient population. Studies have shown that older age is predictive of a better response to pneumatic dilation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>The results discussed above are from studies in which &quot;graded&quot; or &quot;on-demand&quot; dilations were performed. A less popular regimen (the &quot;progressive&quot; method) practiced in Europe consists of a series of progressively larger dilations on the same or successive days until &quot;satisfactory&quot; manometric (eg, lower esophageal sphincter pressure &lt;15 mmHg) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic criteria are met. A retrospective study of 209 patients who underwent PD by this method found that the response to a single series of dilations was 66 percent at six years. Forty-nine patients with recurrent symptoms underwent a second series of dilations 6.5 years later with a 65 percent long-term success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These figures appear better than the graded method, but these two methods have never been directly compared. At this time, it is not clear which method is more effective or safer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictors of outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two strongest predictors of outcome following PD are postdilation LES pressure and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/14,19,29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,29,32</a>]. Male sex and patterns of esophageal contraction seen on manometry may also predict the response to PD.</p><p>A postdilation decrease in LES pressure to approximately 10 mmHg has been suggested as a reasonable goal of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The value of achieving this goal was supported in a prospective study of 54 patients who were followed for 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who achieved a postdilation pressure of less than 10 mmHg were much more likely to be in remission during follow-up compared with those with higher LES pressures (100 versus 23 percent).</p><p>The significance of pretreatment LES pressure with regard to long-term response is unclear. Many studies have found that pretreatment LES pressure does not influence response rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/14,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33,34</a>]. However, one study of 62 patients found that a pretreatment LES pressure &gt;50 mmHg was associated with a poor response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Higher postdilation distensibility of the esophagogastric junction is associated with a better treatment response compared with those with lower distensibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] &#160;</p><p>Young age (&lt;40 years) predicts a poor response to pneumatic dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/15,19,32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,32,36,37</a>]. As an example, in the prospective series of 54 patients discussed above, the remission rate in patients older than 40 was much higher than in younger patients (58 versus 16 percent at five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Sex has also been implicated as a predictor of response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38</a>]. In a retrospective study of 49 men and 16 women, young men treated with a 3 cm balloon required repeat treatment more frequently than young women (hazard ratio 1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The authors concluded that young men may benefit from an initial PD with a 3.5 cm balloon.</p><p>The pattern of esophageal contractions seen on high-resolution esophageal manometry may also predict treatment response. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Influence of achalasia subtype'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of other factors have been suggested to have a role in predicting the response to PD, but none has proven to be a reliable predictor. These include duration of symptoms, the results of initial manometric studies, findings on nuclear emptying scintigraphy, the size of the balloon dilators used, and findings on postdilation <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagrams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/6,29,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29,38-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">PD after failed myotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PD has been studied as a treatment option in patients who have failed surgical myotomy for achalasia or who have had symptomatic recurrence following surgical myotomy. The response to dilation in patients who have failed myotomy is not as good as the response seen in patients who are treatment na&iuml;ve. In one report, 22 of 139 patients undergoing PD had failed prior surgical myotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

First, the protocol for pneumatic dilation used in this trial was rigorous, involving up to three sets of balloon dilations over a period of &gt;2 years, with individual sets including as many as three separate dilation sessions. Each dilation session generally means a day lost from work. By contrast, the inconvenience of Heller myotomy is primarily &quot;up front,&quot; involving the operation itself and the postoperative recovery. Furthermore, esophageal perforations occurred in approximately 4 percent of patients treated with this rigorous pneumatic dilation protocol, requiring hospitalization, and in some cases, emergency surgical repair with an open (rather than laparoscopic) procedure. In addition, the balloon dilations and operations in this trial were performed by very experienced gastroenterologists and surgeons.

Type II (with pressurization) patients have at least two swallows that are associated with pan-esophageal pressurization.

This has led to concern regarding the effects of prior PD or BT treatment on the success of subsequent surgery.</p><p>The available data in humans are conflicting. Some studies suggest that prior endoscopic therapy decreases the efficacy of subsequent myotomy and may increase complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/99-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-102</a>]. However, because the studies were not randomized, it is not possible to determine whether the lower efficacy was due to a true effect or to the inclusion of patients in the myotomy following endoscopic treatment who were refractory to any form of treatment.</p><p>Other nonrandomized studies have shown similar surgical outcomes with regard to efficacy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications for patients who had previously received endoscopic therapy compared with patients undergoing laparoscopic myotomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumatic-dilation-and-botulinum-toxin-injection-for-achalasia/abstract/103-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-107</a>].

In addition, BT injection does not require specialized training and can be easily performed during routine endoscopy. Prior studies suggest that symptom recurrence with both of these techniques is common, and it is not clear if prior endoscopic therapy adversely affects future surgical myotomy. However, more recent data suggest that in experienced hands, PD may have success rates similar to surgical myotomy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of PD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of BT injection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Impact of endoscopic treatment on subsequent myotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgery has the advantage of offering a more permanent solution for managing the symptoms of achalasia, with the disadvantages of being a more invasive procedure and of putting patients at increased risk for reflux and other surgical complications. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Comparative studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Impact of endoscopic treatment on subsequent myotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of achalasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to choosing among the various treatments for a given patient is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-achalasia#H3681795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of achalasia&quot;, section on 'Choice of treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there is no cure for achalasia, regular follow-up is required. We evaluate patients within one month following endoscopic therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic are offered repeat dilation.</p><p>Patients are usually referred to surgery if three consecutive dilatations do not provide symptom resolution. Consideration for surgical referral should also be made in patients with early symptom recurrence following pneumatic dilation (PD). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of PD'</a> above.)</p><p>The follow-up of patients treated with botulinum toxin (BT) depends upon the indication for BT. As noted above, we typically reserve BT injections for patients who are (1) not surgical or PD candidates, (2) those reluctant to undergo surgery or PD, or (3) patients with atypical presentations of achalasia to help guide therapy. In the first scenario, we monitor patients closely for recurrence of symptoms and offer repeat BT injections until they become surgical candidates or until BT loses efficacy if they remain poor surgical candidates. In the second scenario, we monitor the patient closely at one and four months after therapy. If there is no response after two BT injections, we encourage proceeding to either PD or surgery. In the third scenario, patients who respond to BT injection are referred for surgery or PD if the patient is reluctant to have surgery.</p><p>Patients who do well with the above therapies, especially BT injection, require close follow-up to monitor for symptom recurrence. BT injection patients are followed one month after therapy and subsequently every three months until symptom recurrence. PD patients are followed-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after therapy and every four to six months thereafter. In addition to recurrence of dysphagia, particular attention is paid to the development of reflux symptoms and proton pump inhibitor therapy is often prescribed empirically.</p><p>Some experts suggest that patients treated with BT or PD be assessed radiographically, with the goal of recognizing and treating early recurrence of obstruction, but this practice is difficult to justify if the patient is truly asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

While symptom recurrence is common with BT, in experienced hands, PD may have success rates similar to surgical myotomy, but may require repeat dilations in a significant number of patients (25 to 50 percent) along with a nontrivial risk of perforation.

Better results have been seen in studies that used multiple treatment sessions, with clinical benefit seen in 60 to 85 percent of patients at two years. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of BT injection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common complications of BT injection are postprocedural transient chest pain (25 percent) and heartburn (5 percent).

One-third to one-half of patients treated with PD will require at least one additional dilation, and a subset of these patients will require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of PD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complications of PD include esophageal perforation, development of bleeding, intramural hematomas, esophageal mucosal tears, diverticula of the gastric cardia, and gastroesophageal reflux.
