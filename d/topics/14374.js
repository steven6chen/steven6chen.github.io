The widespread use of interferon (IFN) therapy in chronic viral hepatitis has provided another dimension because of the diverse biologic activities of administered IFNs and their propensity to induce <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> modify autoimmunity.</p><p>IFNs comprise a group of related proteins whose effects include antiviral activity, growth regulatory properties, inhibition of angiogenesis, regulation of cell differentiation, enhancement of major histocompatibility complex antigen expression, and a wide variety of immunomodulatory activities. They were originally classified according to their source and have subsequently been renamed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocyte interferon is interferon-alfa (IFNa)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibroblast interferon is interferon-beta (IFNb)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune interferon is interferon-gamma (IFNg)</p><p/><p>At least 18 distinct genes for human IFNa (including 4 pseudogenes) are known; in comparison, there is only one IFNb and one IFNg gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A class of cytokines distantly related to IFNa and the interleukin 10 family comprising three genes designated as interleukins 28A, 28B, and 29 has been discovered and termed interferon-lambda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These cytokines resemble conventional IFNa because they are induced by viral infection and double-stranded RNA and render cells resistant to viral infections by activation of the same intracellular pathways.</p><p>Most cells have receptors and respond to IFNss. IFNa and IFNb (type 1 IFN) bind to the same cell surface receptor, albeit with different affinities, whereas IFNg binds to a distinct receptor for type 2 IFNs. Lambda IFNs bind to a shared own receptor consisting of the interleukin 10 receptor beta and an orphan class II receptor chain designated as IL-28Ra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On average, type 1 IFNs are more than 30 percent homologous and the genes are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 9. None has introns and all have transcripts with 3' instability sequences. In contrast, the IFNg gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 and has four exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Genes of lambda IFNs share 15 to 20 percent sequence homology with IFNa, but are clustered on chromosome 19 and contain multiple exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERFERON THERAPY IN LIVER DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 1 interferons (IFNs) were the first therapeutic agents that permitted successful antiviral therapy with acceptable side effects in patients with chronic hepatitis B, D, and C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although direct-acting antivirals offering the opportunity for IFN-free regimens have become a new paradigm in the treatment of viral hepatitis, IFN-based antiviral therapies are still being used worldwide. Among the agents available worldwide for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis are several recombinant alfa IFNs (mainly IFN-alfa-2a, mixtures containing several type 1 IFNs from natural sources, and IFNb). Recombinant IFNs have also been coupled to polyethylene glycol molecules to modify their pharmacokinetic properties and prolong their half-lives. This modification has significantly improved their therapeutic efficacy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>). In addition, IFNs can be combined with antiviral drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> and protease inhibitors. (See appropriate topic reviews). </p><p>In contrast to type 1 IFNs, IFNg, either alone or in combination with type 1 IFNs, has <strong>no</strong> apparent therapeutic effect on chronic viral liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Lambda IFNs inhibit replication of hepatitis B and C viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, their clinical evaluation as treatment options for viral hepatitis has not resulted in new antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, they seem to exert pivotal immunoregulatory effects since polymorphisms in the IL28B gene, coding for IFN-lambda-3, have been identified in genome-wide genetic screens to be a prognostic factor for (pegylated) IFN-alfa-induced and spontaneous elimination of hepatitis C virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action in chronic viral hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is assumed that increased expression of antiviral genes induced by type 1 IFNs is an important factor in the elimination of hepatitis viruses. These antiviral genes are only partially understood with respect to function; they comprise 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase, a 60 kDa protein kinase, and the Mx protein homologue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lambda IFNs activate the same set genes as type 1 IFNs, but induce steady increases in gene activity and can enhance the antiviral effect of subsaturating doses of IFNa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Since control of chronic hepatitis B is only rarely achieved in patients with an incompetent immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the immunostimulatory properties of type 1 IFNs are probably required to eliminate the hepatitis B virus. A variable reduction of HBV-DNA can be observed in all patients during IFN treatment; however, a transient flare of aminotransferases followed by their normalization, loss of serum HBV-DNA, and loss of HBeAg and HBsAg is only observed in complete IFN responders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This flare is preceded by increased serum levels of beta2-microglobulin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alfa and soluble TNF receptors, and elevations of plasma aminotransferases. It has been attributed to destruction of virus-infected hepatocytes by cytolytic immune effector cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In comparison, a transient flare of aminotransferases is not usually observed with IFN therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Those patients who respond to IFN usually show a gradual decrease in serum aminotransferases shortly after the initiation of IFN therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERFERON-INDUCED AUTOIMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because type 1 interferons (IFNs) have such marked immunomodulatory effects, they also have the potential to lead to development of autoimmune phenomena during prolonged courses of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>]. IFN therapy may aggravate preexisting autoimmunity, unmask silent autoimmune processes, or even induce de novo autoimmune diseases. As an example, enhanced humoral immunity with hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphadenopathy, and increased serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 have been reported in a patient treated with both IFN-alfa (IFNa) and IFN-beta (IFNb) for chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A predisposition to autoimmunity associated with the presence of baseline autoantibodies has been demonstrated in IFN-mediated autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The association of type 1 IFN-induced autoimmune disease with certain HLA phenotypes has also been proposed. No association of autoantibodies with IFN autoantibodies has been detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of autoantibody formation in IFN-induced autoimmunity is incompletely understood. A number of factors might alter the balance between self-tolerance and activation of autoreactivity. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct effects of type 1 IFNs on antibody production, inhibition of regulatory T cells and other cell types with suppressor functions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced expression of MHC class I antigens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aberrant or enhanced MHC class II antigen expression with subsequent activation of T helper lymphocytes by autoantigens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced conversion of monocytes to (auto-)antigen-presenting dendritic cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor, and others)</p><p/><p>Whatever the mechanism, patients receiving long-term therapy with type 1 IFNs must be carefully monitored for the possible development of autoantibodies and autoimmune disease. This issue is further complicated in patients with chronic liver diseases accompanied by a high spontaneous incidence of autoimmune features (eg, autoimmune hepatitis) or in whom frank autoimmune disease such as vasculitis is present. Of note, coexisting overt autoimmune diseases in patients with viral hepatitis carry a substantial risk to exacerbate with IFN therapy. Thus, IFNs should be avoided in such patients, who should be treated IFNfree with direct-acting antiviral agents instead. Conversely, the presence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies, although frequently not relevant as a marker of autoimmunity in chronic hepatitis C, seems to reduce the response to <span class=\"nowrap\">IFN/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a></span> combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Finally, a sustained virological response in hepatitis C does not apparently alter the risk to develop significant autoimmunity later on [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Several diseases and syndromes have been reported in patients with malignant and nonmalignant conditions treated with IFN. These include rheumatoid symptoms, a lupus-like disease, rheumatoid factor-positive monoarthritis, the antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes mellitus, interstitial pneumonitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, psoriasis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, thyroid disease, and autoimmune liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80557\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80557 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The major autoimmune disorders encountered during IFN treatment of liver disease involve the thyroid gland and the liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid autoantibodies and disorders have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis both before and after IFN treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/20,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29-34</a>]. The prevalence appears greater in those with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The reported frequency of thyroid disorders after type 1 IFNs varies; this may be due to several factors including different diagnostic criteria and study populations, dose and duration of IFN treatment, and concurrent medications. Whether frequencies in developing thyroid autoantibodies differ between treatment with pegylated IFNa and conventional IFN is uncertain since studies have been mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>The most common IFNa-associated thyroid abnormality is the development of antithyroid antibodies without clinical disease (5 to up to 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients develop clinical thyroid disease, including painless thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/29,30,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,37,38</a>]. In rare instances, Graves' ophthalmopathy has been reported following treatment of hepatitis C with IFNa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Interestingly, some studies have suggested that the development of thyroid disorders during IFN treatment of chronic hepatitis C is associated with an increased likelihood of a sustained virological response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The changes in thyroid function usually appear after three months of therapy, but can occur as long as IFNa is given. Rare patients develop thyroid autoantibodies after IFNa treatment has been completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The risk of any form of thyroid disease is greater in those patients who have increased serum antithyroid antibody concentrations before initiation of IFNa, a finding which suggests that IFNa in some way exacerbates underlying thyroid autoimmune disease. These relationships and the frequency of thyroid disease can be illustrated by the following observations from several large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/29,30,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,43,44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter survey of 616 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with IFN-alfa-2a found a 5 percent prevalence of hypothyroidism prior to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. An additional 5 percent developed thyroid dysfunction during therapy. Patients in both categories were predominantly female. In those patients who developed thyroid disease during IFN therapy, approximately 25 percent were positive for antithyroid peroxidase antibodies at baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report evaluated 422 patients with chronic viral hepatitis C, B, or D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Increased titers of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were clustered significantly among women (8.7 versus 3.4 percent), particularly those with chronic hepatitis C (11.2 versus 3.6 percent). Treatment with IFNa significantly increased the prevalence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (12.5 to 18.6 percent) and thyroid dysfunction (3.7 to 9.7 percent); euthyroid patients with high baseline antithyroid peroxidase concentration developed thyroid dysfunction during IFNa therapy at an even higher rate (36.4 percent). Hypothyroidism was the most common thyroid abnormality; this occurred early (on treatment) or late (six months after cessation of therapy), and did not necessarily resolve when IFNa was discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 625 HCV-infected patients with normal thyroid function at baseline reported the appearance of thyroid abnormalities in 58 patients (9 percent) during IFN treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Twenty-six patients had hypothyroidism and nine had hyperthyroidism, with Graves' disease in three patients. Twenty-one patients had biphasic thyroiditis, and in two patients anti-thyroid-peroxidase antibodies appeared without hypothyroidism. Female sex and preexisting thyroid-peroxidase antibodies were identified as risk factors for developing thyroiditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 869 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 and 3 were randomized to treatment with either pegylated IFN-alfa-2a weekly or albumin-coupled IFN-alfa-2b every two weeks reported at least one abnormal serum thyrotropin (TSH) in 20.8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On multivariate regression analysis, biphasic thyroiditis, which accounted for 58 percent of all thyroid abnormalities, was associated with female sex and high pretreatment TSH, while Asian descent and being a smoker decreased the risk of thyroiditis.</p><p/><p>These data suggest that the presence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies before treatment appears to be the most significant risk factor for development of clinical thyroid disease during IFN therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/20,30,34,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30,34,44</a>]. Additional risk factors for thyroid disease during IFN treatment may include female gender, older age, and the presence of other autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At least one report also found that the presence of liver-kidney microsomal antibodies was associated with an increased risk of development of thyroid disorders during IFN therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Some studies suggest a genetic predisposition to develop thyroid disease under IFN therapy putatively linked to genes involved in immune regulation and cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Women with chronic hepatitis C and high antithyroid peroxidase antibody titers are at particular risk. The risk of thyroid dysfunction under IFN therapy may also be increased in children with hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> to IFN therapy does not alter the thyroid autoantibody pattern but increases the risk of developing hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Most patients with increased thyroid autoantibodies or thyroid dysfunction will recover after completion of antiviral therapy. Thus, interruption of IFN treatment may not always be required but nevertheless should be recommended for patients with severe symptoms. Following IFN withdrawal, spontaneous normalization of thyroid function can be expected in many patients with painless thyroiditis and (biphasic) Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], while thyroid abnormalities usually persist in those with Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/34,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,51,52</a>]. Persistent thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies after stopping IFN therapy predict the later development of thyroid dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

An asymptomatic rise in serum aminotransferases has been noted in up to 25 percent of patients treated by type 1 IFNs for malignancies and in as many as 80 percent of patients who were treated with doses greater than 100 million units per week. Abnormalities were usually seen at the onset of IFN therapy and the elevation in serum aminotransferases resolved with continued therapy or after dose reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>Direct IFN-associated liver toxicity is rare during IFN treatment of viral hepatitis and is not considered to be immune-mediated. Furthermore, as noted above, the typical flare of aminotransferases during therapy of chronic hepatitis B, which heralds seroconversion, is not regarded as evidence of autoimmunity. However, fatal hepatic decompensation with ascites, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy can occur occasionally during such flares. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autoimmune hepatitis can develop during treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C with IFN. Although generally considered to be rare, in one report of 144 patients with hepatitis C, deterioration in liver function and the development of autoantibodies occurred in seven (5 percent) during IFN therapy, all of whom were women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Some of these patients had preexisting autoantibodies, suggesting that they may be predisposed to autoimmune hepatitis during IFN therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Autoantibodies were also frequently detected in HCV-infected children at baseline (19 percent), during IFN therapy (23 percent) and at follow-up (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, detection of such autoantibodies did not correlate with the viral response, side effects, or development of autoimmune diseases during therapy. Autoantibody screening before the start of IFN therapy has also not proven useful in adult patients with hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Autoimmune hepatitis developed during treatment with standard IFN in most reports. Whether the risk differs between pegylated and standard IFNs is unclear. Only a few case reports have been published on autoimmune hepatitis developing during treatment with peginterferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. A plasma-cell rich autoimmune-type hepatitis has also been observed under immunosuppression after liver transplantation, when recurrent hepatitis C was treated with peginterferon in a patient without prior evidence for autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In rare patients, autoimmune hepatitis has developed long-term (1 to 10 years) after IFN therapy of chronic hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Of note, this late form of autoimmune hepatitis was apparently not related to the outcome of hepatitis C therapy.</p><p>Since amino acid sequences of the hepatitis C virus share homologies with the human cytochromes and cellular structures, molecular mimicry may contribute to virus-triggered autoimmunity. There is a striking prevalence of autoimmune phenomena in patients with chronic hepatitis C including circulating cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor and nonspecific autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antibodies, liver kidney microsomal (LKM)-1 antibodies, and antithyroid antibodies.</p><p>At the molecular level, different specificities of anti-LKM-1 antibodies (which, in autoimmune hepatitis type 2, are directed against an epitope of cytochrome P450 2D6 [CYP2D6]) can be demonstrated when comparing patients with hepatitis C and true autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. A study using recombinant CYP2D6 and synthetic peptides from this protein showed that anti-LKM-1 antibodies from patients with autoimmune hepatitis were directed against antigens which differed from those in chronic hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The distinction between autoimmune hepatitis and chronic hepatitis C is particularly important with respect to therapy. Autoimmune hepatitis benefits from immunosuppression by corticosteroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, while hepatitis C infection is generally treated with antiviral agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>). However, nowadays, an IFN-free regimen of direct-acting antivirals should be given to patients with hepatitis C and overt clinical features of autoimmunity. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate IFN therapy of autoimmune hepatitis can exacerbate the liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy in hepatitis C infection can lower aminotransferase levels; however, it is generally accompanied by a rise of viral load.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia can be considerably improved by IFN therapy in 60 to 80 percent of patients with HCV viremia, although persistent viral clearance is achieved only infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, some patients with cryoglobulinemia respond to steroid therapy without apparent deterioration of their chronic hepatitis C. Treatment with the anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> appears promising. Rituximab has also been successfully combined with IFN and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with hepatitis C and anti-LKM-1 antibodies, as well as other types of non-organ-specific autoantibodies, appear to benefit from IFN to the same extent as patients with chronic hepatitis C without such antibodies. However, such patients need meticulous monitoring during IFN treatment, since flares of aminotransferases without subsequent clearance of HCV RNA have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. This observation suggests that these patients may behave as if they had autoimmune hepatitis. In support of this hypothesis is the finding that when patients with chronic hepatitis C with or without anti-LKM-1 antibodies were compared, the viral load was lower in the patients with anti-LKM-1 antibodies even though both groups had disease of similar severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Furthermore, some of these patients have responded to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> directed against presumed autoimmune hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p/><p>When exacerbation occurs during IFN therapy, IFN must be withdrawn. The benefit of introducing immunosuppression at this point must be balanced against the associated risks of increased viral replication. IFN-induced autoimmune hepatitis in hepatitis C can occur suddenly and may progress to fulminant hepatic failure, and thus requires rapid recognition and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Taking into account the high prevalence of non-organ specific antibodies in chronic hepatitis C, it is important to emphasize that the presence of such antibodies alone has little predictive value for IFN-induced liver-related autoimmunity and that IFN treatment can induce autoimmune hepatitis in individuals without preexisting features of autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases occur in the same patients, and female gender and specific HLA phenotypes may be genetically predisposing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/57,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,74</a>]. Similarly, IFN-induced autoimmune hepatitis can occur in patients without preexisting liver disease, as has been reported in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune-mediated skin diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous reactions to IFN therapy, both local and distant from the injection sites, are common.

There are also isolated reports of the development or exacerbation of lichen planus and psoriasis during IFN treatment for chronic HCV; in these cases, skin lesions improve when IFN is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. In addition, repeated local panniculitis following injection of pegylated interferon has been reported in a patient with hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>] pleural effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>] as well as exacerbation of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>] and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] have been observed during IFN therapy. Pulmonary complications of IFN therapy appear to be rare. However, prompt investigation and discontinuation of medication is warranted, if any signs of significant pulmonary involvement develop, because pulmonary dysfunction can become severe, and the outcome is variable. Pneumonitis can present with any combination of fever, dyspnea, and cough, and affects males and females equally and has been described with both standard and peginterferon. In a comprehensive review of the literature and drug toxicity databases, a mortality rate of 7 percent was observed in patients who developed pneumonitis during treatment with peginterferon-alfa-2b [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Pneumonitis has also been reported with peginterferon-alfa-2a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>There is no consensus concerning treatment of interstitial pneumonitis induced by IFN. In most reports, pneumonitis improved after IFN withdrawal alone or with corticosteroids. The relatively high mortality rate suggests favoring an aggressive approach, particularly in patients treated with peginterferon who probably should be treated with corticosteroids early after the diagnosis of pneumonitis has been established.</p><p>In some clinical trials for hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>] the reported incidence of dyspnea and cough were higher in patients on peginterferon combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> than in patients with IFN monotherapy. However, it remains unclear whether this observation reflects increased pulmonary toxicity of peginterferons or immune-modulating effects of ribavirin. De novo induction and exacerbation of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>] have been observed during IFN therapy.

Many more IFNa-treated patients develop a lupus-like syndrome with only some SLE symptoms, which are insufficient to formally fulfill diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. SLE and lupus-like syndrome have reportedly occurred after a wide range of exposure times, including as early as one month and as late as seven years after drug initiation. Typical manifestations of SLE such as malar rash, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, renal disease and typical autoantibodies (eg, anti-Sm or anti-dsDNA) have been observed, suggesting that these cases were not &quot;drug-induced&quot; SLE but instead resembled idiopathic SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>] &#160;</p><p>As observed in other cases of drug-induced lupus, SLE due to IFNa affects males and females equally.
