We typically treat with these conservative therapies for six weeks before considering subsequent therapies. It is also reasonable to treat with conservative therapies for up to six months, particularly in obese women who are likely to experience improved bladder control following weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16614264\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifying contributory factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before starting any treatment for urinary incontinence, contributory factors such as medical conditions and medications should be addressed, particularly in older patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101070 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Although commonly recommended and generally low risk, other lifestyle modifications that focus on dietary changes, fluid restriction, and caffeine reduction have been less studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight loss</strong> &ndash; Obesity is a known risk factor for urinary incontinence, and weight loss in obese women appears to improve symptoms of urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. Studies show greater benefits for stress incontinence than urgency incontinence. For example, one randomized trial of 338 overweight and obese women (mean body mass index [BMI] 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> found that weekly incontinence episodes decreased in women assigned to an intensive six-month weight loss program compared with a control group (47 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Mean weight loss was 7.8 kg in the intervention group and 1.5 kg in the control group. While the difference in the groups was driven by a decrease in episodes of stress incontinence but not urgency incontinence, more women in the intervention group had a &ge;70 percent reduction in the frequency of all incontinence episodes.

Women who are drinking excess amounts of liquids (&gt;64 ounces of liquids) should normalize their fluid intake, unless there is a medical reason why they need to consume more liquids. We do not restrict fluid consumption below this level as this can lead to dehydration. Women are advised to consume liquids (mostly water) in small amounts of throughout the day, rather than drinking large volumes at one time. We also ask women who complain of nocturia to decrease or eliminate liquid consumed after dinner (or within several hours before bedtime).

Beyond the general health benefits of smoking cessation, no studies have evaluated whether smoking cessation decreases urinary incontinence.

Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises strengthen the pelvic floor musculature to provide a backboard for the urethra to compress on and to reflexively inhibit detrusor contractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16614563\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These exercises can be effective for both stress and urgency incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). The basic regimen consists of three sets of 8 to 12 contractions sustained for 8 to 10 seconds each, performed three times a day. Patients should try to do this every day and continue for at least 15 to 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials have found that, compared with no treatment, women treated with pelvic muscle exercises were more likely to report improvement or cure (55 versus 3 percent; relative risk [RR] 17.3; 95% CI 4.3-69.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/8,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21989367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Stress incontinence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21989566\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Urgency incontinence'</a>.)</p><p>Patients have better outcomes with regular exercise and proper technique. Adequacy of pelvic floor muscle contraction can be assessed during the pelvic examination. The examiner places one or two fingers within the vagina and asks the patient to contract her pelvic floor using the same muscles she would use to stop urine flow or colonic gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In women who are able to isolate their pelvic floor muscles to stop urine flow, verbal instruction on timing and frequency of exercise is usually sufficient. For those with difficulty identifying the proper muscles, supplemental modalities can help women to perform these exercises properly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1487896463\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplemental modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who are able to isolate pelvic floor musculature, supplemental therapy may not be necessary. However, other patients may have difficulty because of poor muscle isolation, low motivation, or inability to properly contract the pelvic floor. For these patients, we use supplemental therapies such as supervised pelvic floor therapy, vaginal weighted cones, or biofeedback (based on patient preference, access, and availability), although systematic reviews have not identified any of these modalities as superior over others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supervised pelvic floor therapy</strong> &ndash; Women who are having difficulty performing the exercises or have no improvement may benefit from referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist or continence nurse where available. Pelvic muscle exercises are most effective with specific instruction by health professionals and regular performance by motivated patients. It is not clear how much health care supervision is optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal weighted cones</strong> &ndash; Pelvic muscle exercises can be supplemented by the use of weighted vaginal cones. These may be preferable for women who have insufficient time or resources to dedicate to supervised physical therapy or biofeedback. The woman inserts the cone in her vagina and uses pelvic muscle contractions to hold it in place during activity. A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 small randomized trials found some evidence that cones have increased efficacy over no active treatment but inconclusive evidence that they provide increased efficacy over standard pelvic floor muscle exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Vaginal weighted cones are available without a prescription and typically ordered online or from a medical supply store.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biofeedback</strong> &ndash; Biofeedback as a supplement to pelvic muscle exercises is particularly useful in women who are unable to properly isolate the pelvic floor or use accessory muscles during pelvic floor contractions. This modality involves placement of a vaginal pressure sensor within the vagina that measures pressure and provides an audible or visual feedback of strength of pelvic floor contraction. Augmented versions also use abdominal and perineal electromyography (EMG) recordings to demonstrate improper contraction of abdominal and gluteal muscles. In the United States, biofeedback is covered by Medicare for patients who fail an initial four-week trial of behavioral therapy. Biofeedback is often used in conjunction with supervised pelvic floor physical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized or quasi-randomized trials found that compared with women who received pelvic floor muscle exercises alone, those that also received biofeedback were more likely to report improvement or cure of urinary incontinence (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Biofeedback can also be done using electrical stimulation. The device is placed in the vagina or anus and provides a small electrical current that stimulates the pelvic floor muscles to contract, aiding the patient in identification and isolation of the proper muscles. A 2012 review of nine studies found that, compared with sham stimulation, intravaginal electrical stimulation improved continence rates for women with urgency, stress, or mixed incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16614795\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder training is most effective for women with urgency incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some women who have stress incontinence only at higher bladder volumes may also benefit from the timed voiding component to keep bladder volumes below that where stress incontinence occurs. Bladder training and pelvic muscle exercises are often used in combination with dietary and lifestyle modifications. While evidence supporting bladder training is generally weak, clinical experience supports the practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Bladder training starts with timed voiding.

The shortest voiding interval is used when initiating bladder training. The patient is instructed to void by the clock at regular intervals while awake, using the shortest interval between voids identified on the voiding diary as the initial voiding interval. Urgency between voiding times is controlled with either distraction or mental relaxation techniques (eg, performing mental math, deep breathing) along with quick contractions of the pelvic floor muscles &quot;quick flicks&quot; to suppress urgency and bladder contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When the patient can avoid leakage for one day using the initial urination interval, the time between scheduled voids is increased by 15 minutes. The intervals are gradually increased until the patient is voiding every three to four hours without urinary incontinence or frequent urgency.</p><p>A patient bladder training instruction sheet is shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71150 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Successful bladder training can take up to six weeks.

GSM is associated with urinary frequency and dysuria and can contribute to incontinence. Available preparations include creams, rings, and tablets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58506 \">table 4</a>). We use topical estrogen cream 0.5 gm twice weekly (conjugated estrogen or estradiol), estradiol tablet 10 mcg twice weekly, or the estradiol ring every three months. It may take up to three months for patients to perceive treatment benefit and some patients may require higher doses.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women#H3964900742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urgency incontinence/overactive bladder in women&quot;, section on 'Exercises, lifestyle and conservative therapies'</a> and <a href=\"#H16614795\" class=\"local\">'Bladder training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We typically treat initially for six weeks before considering subsequent therapies.

Subsequent therapy should be focused first on alleviation of symptoms causing most degree of bother. While surgical treatment of stress symptoms may improve urgency symptoms, surgery should not be considered as a primary treatment for refractory urge incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H16615998\" class=\"local\">'Mixed incontinence treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of overflow incontinence is specific to the etiology.
