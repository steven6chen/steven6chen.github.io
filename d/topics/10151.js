Subsequently, single lung transplantation (SLT) became the most common procedure; however, the proportion of bilateral lung transplants (BLT) has now surpassed SLT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition to these procedures, split lung bilateral lobar transplants and living donor lobar lung transplants were once occasionally performed but have largely fallen out of favor in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reasons for choosing one procedure over another are reviewed here. An overview of the operative techniques is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>According to the 2016 Registry report, the median survival for all adult recipients is 5.8 years, but bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival than single lung recipients (7 versus 4.5 years, respectively) (For a figure showing updated information, please see the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation slide set &quot;Overall Lung and Adult Lung Transplantation Statistics,&quot; slide titled Number of Lung Transplants Performed by Year and Procedure Type at: <a href=\"http://www.ishlt.org/registries/slides.asp?slides=heartLungRegistry&amp;token=x3djU/gR9hjQlMCTrO0sVuK+SR0v2blvAp6zVM7beggKVWo4WlskTJV/fKqLGVmCuVZY36WMXAe/yMaGWJ57csJYVToTbRWlU2Mp2R66kFg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4660\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ISHLT Registry</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it is unclear if this survival advantage is directly related to the type of operation or to the underlying recipient characteristics.</p><p>The general characteristics and <span class=\"nowrap\">advantages/disadvantages</span> of the different types of lung transplantation are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously discussed, there are limited data suggesting that BLT may be associated with improved long-term survival compared with SLT. In addition, BLT may allow greater use of marginal donor lungs that would otherwise be declined for single lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, it provides less lung function as a buffer for late complications. As the operative procedure is shorter than bilateral transplantation, SLT may be preferable in older patients or those who would not tolerate the longer anesthesia time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Split lung bilateral lobar transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal advantage of split lung bilateral lobar transplantation is that it permits single lung transplantation from a donor with a large size discrepancy with the recipient, such as a small adult or child. With this procedure, a single left lung from a donor who is approximately 15 percent taller than the recipient is divided such that the left upper and lower lobes are implanted into the recipient's right and left hemithorax, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. When appropriate, the remaining donor lung is given to another recipient. However, technical difficulties and appropriate donor-recipient size matching have limited the use of this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Living donor lobar lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with kidney and liver transplantation, living donor lobar lung transplantation was developed to increase organ availability and reduce long waiting times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This procedure requires lung tissue from two donors. The right lower lobe retrieved from one donor is implanted into the recipient's right hemithorax, while the left lower lobe from another donor is placed in the recipient's left hemithorax. Because only one lobe is implanted in each hemithorax, this operation is limited to children and adults with small stature. As a result, the number of living donor lobar lung transplants performed annually peaked at 29 in 1999 in the US and has diminished rapidly since the implementation of the current lung allocation system, which accounts for medical urgency. In fact, no living donor lobar transplants were performed in the United States in 2014 or 2015 and only one was performed annually in 2011, 2012, and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in countries where brain death is not recognized, this remains the only viable lung transplant procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart-lung transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart-lung transplantation is reserved for patients with irreversible heart disease that may occur in conjunction with end-stage lung disease. However, the ability to predict whether heart function can recover after lung transplantation alone can be difficult. Severe right ventricular dysfunction, for example, has reversed after isolated lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Therefore, lung transplantation alone can be performed even in the setting of severe right heart failure, unless there is also left ventricular failure. However, the annual volume of combined heart-lung transplantation has been decreasing over the past 20 years in the United States. In fact, 69 heart-lung transplants were performed in 1995, 35 were performed in 2005, and only 15 were performed in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This trend mirrors the annual volume of heart-lung transplants reported to the ISHLT Registry report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE-BASED CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying lung disease is an important factor in deciding which lung transplant procedure to perform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. With the exception of those performed for Eisenmenger syndrome, a majority of lung transplants are bilateral, although variability occurs based on allograft availability, disease-specific concerns, and transplant center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3326230509\"><span class=\"h2\">Interstitial lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>End-stage lung disease from interstitial lung disease (ILD) accounted for about 30 percent of lung transplants performed between 1995 and June 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. However, the proportion of transplants performed for ILD has consistently increased in recent years. In the US, Group D, which includes ILD, accounted for 62 percent of all lung transplants in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among ILDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) most commonly requires lung transplantation; nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the next most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Discussions of the indications for and timing of transplant for IPF and NSIP are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Lung transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-nonspecific-interstitial-pneumonia#H2106300130\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Lung transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>Single lung transplantation was the standard procedure for patients with IPF for many years and survival statistics were comparable to other indications for lung transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57297 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. However, a growing percentage of patients are now undergoing BLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28,29</a>]. For example, over 60 percent of those transplanted in 2014 underwent BLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, only 15 percent of patients with IPF underwent BLT in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The reasons for this shift in practice are unclear, although improved surgical technique, as well as better lung function and longer survival for BLT recipients are likely contributors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The survival outcomes of BLT compared with SLT are described in the 2014 ISHLT Registry Report analysis of 6258 transplants for IPF performed between 2005 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. SLT was associated with a survival benefit in the short term, while BLT was associated with a survival benefit in the long term, particularly beyond three years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64204 \">figure 3</a>). However, this univariate analysis does not account for other potential risk factors (eg, age, lung allocation score) that might influence survival among SLT and BLT recipients. A separate analysis of lung transplant outcomes between 2005 and 2012 in the United States found that bilateral lung transplantation for IPF was associated with better graft survival than single lung transplantation (62 months, interquartile range [IQR] 21.4 to 91.3, versus 50 months, IQR 17 to 87.5, respectively, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, in a recent propensity matched analysis of the UNOS database, BLT was associated with a survival advantage over SLT among patients who were 65 years of age or older, and this survival advantage was detectable by one year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Despite superior survival with BLT, the limited availability of lungs for transplantation makes it more difficult to obtain a BLT than SLT. Among 1339 patients with IPF listed for lung transplantation between May 2005 and June 2009, those listed for BLT only, compared with SLT only or either SLT or BLT, were slightly more likely to die on the waiting list and less likely to receive a transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, the choice of procedure requires careful consideration of the patient&rsquo;s anticipated survival pre and post-transplant.</p><p>Patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) generally have a better prognosis and better response to medical therapy than those with IPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Nonetheless, some patients with NSIP, especially those with the fibrotic variant, have a progressive decline in lung function, and eventually become candidates for transplantation. The choice between SLT and BLT for NSIP follows the experience with IPF described above.</p><p>Living donor lobar lung transplantation has been suggested as an alternative procedure for patients with end-stage IPF who are not expected to survive the waiting time for deceased donor transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, experience with the current UNOS lung organ allocation system suggests that the waiting time for a deceased donor lung for a patient with end-stage IPF should be short and that living donor transplantation is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was the most common indication for lung transplantation in the US, but interstitial lung disease (ILD) has surpassed COPD as the leading indication in recent years, accounting for approximately 50 percent of all lung transplants <span class=\"nowrap\">(OPTN/SRTR</span> Annual Data Report). A similar trend is seen internationally in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry Report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The specific indications for lung transplantation in COPD are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Supportive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The two principal transplant options for those with end-stage COPD are single lung transplantation (SLT) and bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/5,35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35-40</a>]. The choice between these options is center specific, but there is a growing trend in favor of BLT. In an analysis of transplants performed in 2014 from the ISHLT Registry, 80 percent of patients with COPD received a BLT and 20 percent a SLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. By comparison, 80 percent of transplants for COPD in 1993 were SLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a separate analysis, among patients with emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency 88 percent received a BLT and 12 percent an SLT in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A factor favoring the bilateral procedure is the slightly superior actuarial survival in BLT recipients with COPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55546 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/30,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,41</a>]. This trend toward improved long-term survival following bilateral transplantation is primarily seen in patients under age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. A retrospective analysis of 9883 recipients with COPD demonstrated that, among those younger than 60, bilateral transplantation offered a survival advantage over single lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In contrast, among those older than 60, the survival benefit of bilateral transplantation over single was no longer apparent. A possible explanation for this is that SLT is a simpler, shorter operation with a lower perioperative complication rate than BLT in older patients with emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a separate analysis that adjusted for treatment selection bias, age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and other co-morbid factors, there was no significant survival benefit at five years associated with BLT over SLT for COPD, although there was a significant survival benefit at five years associated with BLT for ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. COPD results in significant hyperinflation of the thoracic cavity, and this allows the implantation of an oversized single allograft, which may mitigate some of the benefits of BLT over SLT. Further study is needed to determine the optimal procedure in patients with COPD.</p><p>There are a few additional differences between SLT and BLT that may provide a survival benefit with BLT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following SLT, a few patients develop severe hyperinflation of the remaining native lung such that it crosses the mediastinum and compresses the transplanted lung. When this occurs, lung volume reduction surgery of the native lung is sometimes needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The leading cause of death among lung transplant recipients over the long term is chronic rejection. Among those who develop this complication, BLT recipients survive longer than patients who have received a SLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/41,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,46</a>]. BLT provides additional lung reserve that may compensate for the loss of lung function resulting from chronic rejection, although the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition, SLT may be associated with an increased risk of chronic rejection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Pulmonary function testing provides an indirect measure of quality of life after the different lung transplant procedures. Among patients with COPD who undergo lung transplantation, both BLT and SLT result in an improvement in spirometry; however, the change in exercise capacity is less dramatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/35,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,48,49</a>].

Because of the risk of spillover infection, removal of both lungs is mandatory for lung transplantation for CF and is generally advised for other forms of generalized bronchiectasis although data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Living donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLT) is an alternative that circumvents the shortage of deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This approach is rarely needed now that waiting list times have decreased with the Lung Allocation System. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;, section on 'Lung allocation'</a>.) LDLT is especially suited for children and young adults with CF who are small in size and would attain sufficient lung function from two adult donor lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Long-term survival results with this procedure have been comparable to transplantation from deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Additionally, donor lobectomy has been associated with relatively low morbidity and no mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Single lung transplantation with a contralateral pneumonectomy has been employed in few special circumstances (eg, skeletal asymmetry), but this has not been the standard approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Lung transplantation has been successfully combined with simultaneous liver transplantation in a few patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary arterial hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) accounts for less than 5 percent of lung transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,61</a>].

In the ISHLT Registry, there is a trend towards a survival benefit from BLT, but it does not achieve statistical significance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75206 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>An additional factor that has favored BLT is that SLT for PAH is a difficult procedure. Ventilation is evenly divided between the allograft and the native lung while perfusion is almost entirely directed to the allograft (due to the high pulmonary vascular resistance in the native lung). Any complication in the allograft (eg, pneumonia, primary graft dysfunction, rejection) can result in severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. It is unclear why survival statistics do not clearly favor BLT over SLT, given this perioperative disadvantage of SLT.</p><p>Heart-lung transplantation was originally the standard procedure for patients with PAH. However, it was replaced by isolated lung transplantation in most centers in the 1990s. This is because right ventricular dysfunction recovers quickly with the rapid reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance after lung transplantation, making heart transplantation unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Eisenmenger syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eisenmenger syndrome may result from atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or multiple cardiac anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Both heart-lung transplantation and lung transplantation with intracardiac repair are performed for patients with Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The choice is based on whether the cardiac defect is amenable to surgical repair (eg, ASD, PDA). Otherwise, HLT is generally preferred for patients with Eisenmenger syndrome due to VSD or other anomalies that are combined with severe left ventricular failure, when they meet criteria for transplantation. Indications for transplantation are discussed separately. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/43,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,68-71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;, section on 'Transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal therapeutic choice in those with Eisenmenger syndrome is based principally upon the underlying heart disorder. Data in support of specific options are derived entirely from retrospective reviews of relatively small numbers of patients. In one of the larger retrospective reviews, the outcomes after lung and heart-lung transplantation were reported for 605 patients with Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Causes of the syndrome included ASD (171 patients), VSD (164), multiple congenital anomalies (68) and PDA (32). Procedures included HLT, BLT, and SLT in 430, 106 and 69 transplants, respectively. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with VSD, there was improved survival following HLT compared with BLT and SLT. This seemed related to early postoperative ventricular failure in the lung transplant group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival following BLT or SLT for ASD or PDA is not as good as HLT for VSD or multiple cardiac anomalies. This suggests some technical difficulties arise when <span class=\"nowrap\">BLT/SLT</span> are combined with cardiac repair, compared with the relatively more simple procedure of HLT.</p><p/><p>In patients with cardiac anomalies that can be surgically repaired (eg, ASD, PDA), the scarcity of heart-lung blocks makes it preferable to combine lung transplantation with intraoperative cardiac repair, unless the combined procedure would require prolonged time on cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. If the cardiac repair is more complicated than ASD or PDA repair, HLT is generally preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary hypertension due to underlying lung parenchymal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with end-stage lung disease often develop pulmonary hypertension (PH). Heart-lung transplant is generally not needed unless both left and right heart failure are present. Data are conflicting as to whether PH should affect the choice of SLT versus BLT. In a retrospective review that compared outcomes among 104 patients with normal mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAM), mildly elevated PAM, and high PAM, no differences in survival were noted between types of procedure (SLT or BLT) or between levels of PAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In contrast, among patients undergoing transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, PH was an independent risk factor for early mortality after single lung transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H892470273\"><span class=\"h1\">RETRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because outcomes after lung transplantation remain disappointing and graft failure is the leading cause of death, retransplantation can be considered in carefully selected patients. However, survival remains significantly worse after retransplantation than after primary transplantation, although survival after retransplantation has improved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,73</a>]. In the 2016 ISHLT Registry, the median survival after retransplantation was 2.8 years compared with 5.8 years after primary transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Retransplantation is technically more difficult because of thoracic adhesions due to primary transplantation. Because of these technical challenges, SLT is sometimes the only feasible retransplant procedure. However, based on outcomes data after retransplantation from the UNOS Registry, SLT was associated with an increased risk of death compared to BLT in a multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-disease-based-choice-of-procedure/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) is now the most common lung transplant procedure, followed by single lung transplantation (SLT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71574 \">figure 1</a>). In contrast, heart-lung transplantation has become an uncommon procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of types of lung transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, BLT is necessary only for bronchiectasis (eg, cystic fibrosis), but it is often performed for other indications because of the perceived better long-term outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLT extends the limited supply of donor organs to more patients, but it provides less lung function as a buffer for late complications than BLT and may not be appropriate when using marginal organ donors. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Single lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living lobar lung transplantation in which each of two donors provides a lobe was developed to increase organ availability and reduce long waiting times, but this has become an uncommon procedure in recent years because of changes in the allocation system. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Living donor lobar lung transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both SLT and BLT are performed for COPD and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Further study is needed to determine which of these procedures is optimal in patients with COPD. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common interstitial lung disease that requires lung transplantation. SLT is associated with better short term survival, but BLT is associated with better long term survival. (See <a href=\"#H3326230509\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial lung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of both lungs is mandatory in lung transplantation for patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis, because of the risk of spillover infection. Therefore, BLT is the preferred procedure. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cystic fibrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who require lung transplantation, we favor BLT over SLT. A few patients with concomitant left heart failure will need HLT. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary arterial hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart-lung transplantation should be reserved for patients with concomitant lung and heart disease who cannot be treated by lung transplantation alone (eg, Eisenmenger in a patient with a surgically uncorrectable cardiac anomaly).
