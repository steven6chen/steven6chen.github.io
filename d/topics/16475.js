It was first described by the German physician, Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig in 1836. This infection most commonly arises from an infected second or third mandibular molar tooth. It is an aggressive, rapidly spreading cellulitis without lymphadenopathy with potential for airway obstruction and requires careful monitoring and rapid intervention for prevention of asphyxia and aspiration pneumonia.</p><p>The anatomy, microbiology, clinical manifestations, imaging, and treatment of submandibular space infections (Ludwig's angina) will be reviewed here.

It is characteristically an aggressive, rapidly spreading &quot;woody&quot; or brawny cellulitis involving the submandibular space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infection is a rapidly spreading cellulitis without lymphatic involvement and generally without abscess formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the submylohyoid and sublingual spaces are involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infection is bilateral.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975545753\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The submandibular space lies within the submental and submandibular triangles between the mucosa of the floor of the mouth and the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. It is subdivided by the mylohyoid muscle into the sublingual space (which contains the sublingual gland, hypoglossal nerve, part of the submandibular gland, and loose connective tissue) and the submylohyoid space (which contains the submandibular salivary gland and lymph nodes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81946\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81946 \">figure 1</a>). The two divisions can be considered as a single unit, however, as they directly communicate posteriorly around the mylohyoid muscle. This accounts for the bilateral involvement by contiguous spread of infection within the submandibular space in Ludwig&rsquo;s angina.</p><p>An overview of the anatomy of the deep neck spaces and anatomical considerations for other deep neck space infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975545745\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF SPREAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over two-thirds of patients with Ludwig&rsquo;s angina have a dental source of infection, usually involving the second or third mandibular molar teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/submandibular-space-infections-ludwigs-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The submylohyoid space is initially involved, since the roots of these teeth are located below the attachments of the mylohyoid muscle to the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81946\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81946 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>). Other sources of infection include contiguous spread from peritonsillar abscess or suppurative parotitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/submandibular-space-infections-ludwigs-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Medial spread of infection is facilitated because the lingual aspects of periodontal bone around these teeth are thin.<strong> </strong>Infection extends contiguously to involve the sublingual and thus the entire submandibular space in a symmetrical manner. If infection were instead spread via the lymphatics, involvement would be unilateral instead of bilateral as is observed. An identical process, initially involving the sublingual space, can arise less commonly from infection of the premolars and other teeth or from trauma to the floor of the mouth.</p><p>Once established, infection evolves rapidly. The tongue may enlarge to two or three times its normal size and distend posteriorly into the hypopharynx, superiorly against the palate, and anteriorly protruding out of the mouth. Immediate posterior extension of the process will directly involve the epiglottis. There exists a little known dangerous connection between the submandibular and parapharyngeal spaces known as the buccopharyngeal gap. This is created by the styloglossus muscle as it leaves the tongue and passes between the middle and superior constrictor muscles to attach on the styloid process. Thus, cellulitis of the submandibular space may spread directly along the styloglossus muscle into the parapharyngeal space and from there to the retropharyngeal space and the superior mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/submandibular-space-infections-ludwigs-angina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

If cellulitis and swelling continue to advance or if dyspnea occurs, artificial airway control should be gained immediately, before the onset of stridor, cyanosis, and asphyxia. Tracheostomy under emergency conditions may be required in more severe cases.</p><p>If airway compromise is suspected, a recommended approach is to perform fiberoptic intubation via the nasal route. Fibroscopic laryngoscopy is carried out to assess the airway and to aid in nasal intubation of an endotracheal tube under direct observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/submandibular-space-infections-ludwigs-angina/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Blind oral or nasotracheal intubation is both traumatic and unsafe in advanced Ludwig's angina because of the potential for inducing severe laryngospasm. </p><p>If intubation is not possible, tracheostomy is the most widely recommended means of surgical airway control, although cricothyroidotomy is advocated by some experts because of a lower complication rate.
