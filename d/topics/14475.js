Prior to the routine use of antifungal prophylaxis, <em>Candida</em> spp accounted for the majority of fungal infections that occurred during neutropenia, followed by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. More recently, <em>Aspergillus</em> has surpassed <em>Candida</em> as a cause of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, likely due to the use of antifungal prophylaxis targeting <em>Candida</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Both pathogens are associated with substantial risk for mortality.</p><p>In an autopsy study of patients who died after prolonged neutropenic fever between 1966 and 1975, rising rates of fungal infection were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over half of the patients in this early series had <em>Candida</em> infections, which may have been effectively prevented with antifungal prophylaxis. For example, in one trial, fungal infections were documented in only 1 percent of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> prophylaxis who had persistent fevers despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564717552\"><span class=\"h2\">Candida infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Candida</em> is the most important yeast pathogen, accounting for most invasive yeast infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The incidence of invasive candidiasis in patients with hematologic malignancies has varied widely in different studies, likely due to differences in the underlying disease (eg, newly diagnosed, in remission, relapsed, or refractory to treatment), the duration of neutropenia, and the types of chemotherapy regimens used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Rates of invasive <em>Candida</em> infection in patients with hematologic malignancies not receiving antifungal prophylaxis have ranged from 8 to 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>].</p><p>Although <em>Candida</em> is ordinarily a harmless colonizer of mucosal surfaces and skin, breeches in skin or mucosal integrity can lead to invasion of deep tissues and hematogenous dissemination. The portal of entry for this commensal organism is thought to be primarily the gastrointestinal tract in this patient population, with translocation occurring as a result of mucosal injury from cytotoxic chemotherapy. Candidemia is the most frequent clinical manifestation of invasive candidiasis. <em>Candida</em> is also a common fungal cause of central venous catheter&ndash;associated infections. Less commonly, <em>Candida</em> causes disseminated candidiasis, including chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis).

Although <em>C. albicans</em> accounts for about half of invasive <em>Candida</em> infections, patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients are also at increased risk for infections caused by non-albicans <em>Candida</em> species (eg, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. tropicalis</em>) compared with other types of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the incidence of invasive aspergillosis has ranged from 2 to 28 percent, with most studies reporting rates between 5 and 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prophylaxis-of-invasive-fungal-infections-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In such patients, the risk varies according to the disease status; patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving salvage chemotherapy are at the greatest risk, whereas newly diagnosed patients receiving induction chemotherapy are at lower risk. AML patients in remission who are receiving consolidation chemotherapy are at the lowest risk.</p><p>The usual portal of entry of this airborne organism is inhalation into the sinuses and respiratory tract. The most frequent manifestation of invasive aspergillosis is pneumonia. Pulmonary infiltrates due to <em>Aspergillus</em> typically consist of one or more nodules with or without surrounding ground-glass opacities (the halo sign), cavities, air-crescent signs, or focal airspace consolidation. Other manifestations include sinusitis, localized skin ulcers, subcutaneous nodules, cerebral infarction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fulminant disseminated disease.</p><p><em>A. fumigatus</em> is the most common <em>Aspergillus</em> species to cause disease, but several other <em>Aspergillus</em> species also cause invasive disease.

Invasive candidiasis occurs most often as a result of translocation of colonizing <em>Candida</em> spp across the oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal mucosa in the setting of mucositis from cytotoxic chemotherapy. Candidemia is the most frequent clinical manifestation of invasive candidiasis. Patients with acute leukemia are at highest risk for invasive candidiasis during induction chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H564717552\" class=\"local\">'Candida infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Aspergillus</em> is the most common mold pathogen in patients with acute leukemia.

It should be noted that there is ongoing controversy about the use of antifungal prophylaxis. As a result, practices regarding antifungal prophylaxis differ widely at various cancer centers, and our approach may be different from the approach recommended at a specific institution. (See <a href=\"#H564717727\" class=\"local\">'Approach to primary prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H69317229\" class=\"local\">'Risk-benefit assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although antifungal prophylaxis has been proven to be efficacious in selected high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies, issues surrounding overuse of antifungal agents (eg, resistance, toxicity, and cost), and the relatively low incidence of invasive fungal infections in these patients have tempered enthusiasm for universal prophylaxis. The risk-benefit analysis must include an assessment of the relative level of immunosuppression and comorbidities to identify those individuals at increased risk for invasive fungal infections. (See <a href=\"#H69317229\" class=\"local\">'Risk-benefit assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute leukemia undergoing remission-induction or salvage-induction chemotherapy who are expected to develop severe oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal mucositis, we recommend prophylaxis against <em>Candida</em> infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
