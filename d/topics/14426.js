Despite improvements in therapy, the mortality rate in patients with HF has remained unacceptably high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The many factors that can be used to predict survival in HFrEF and the prognosis in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are discussed separately.

The association of nonfatal hospitalization and subsequent mortality rates was studied using data on 7572 chronic heart failure (HF) patients with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the CHARM trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mortality rate was increased after HF hospitalizations, even after adjustment for baseline predictors of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.2; 95% CI 2.8-3.5). The increased risk of death was highest within one month of discharge and declined progressively over time.</p><p>There is an appreciable readmission rate for decompensated HF and patients hospitalized longer or more frequently have a higher mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. In a review of older adult patients, for example, 8 percent required readmission for HF within six months of the initial hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Poor compliance is an important contributing factor in many patients requiring readmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In one series, lack of adherence to the medical program (drug or diet) was the most common reason for readmission, occurring in 41 percent of cases; another 12 percent received inadequate preadmission treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has been estimated that more than one-half of readmissions are preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The roles of drug and device therapy in reducing hospitalization in patients with HFrEF, the impact of drug therapy on hospitalization in patients with diastolic HF, and the use of disease management and other strategies to reduce hospitalization in patients with HF are discussed separately.

The prevalence of an acute coronary finding (coronary thrombus, ruptured plaque, or myocardial infarction) and its relationship to sudden death was examined in an autopsy study of 171 patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In patients with significant coronary artery disease, an acute coronary finding was found in 54 percent who died suddenly and in 32 percent who died of myocardial failure, although an acute coronary event had not been clinically diagnosed before death. By contrast, an acute coronary finding was uncommon in those without coronary disease, present in only 5 percent of those dying from sudden death and 10 percent of those dying from myocardial failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have found a seasonal pattern of deaths from myocardial infarction and sudden death, with more fatal events occurring in the winter than the summer.

A similar seasonal variation has been seen in men and women with chronic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In a large study from France, deaths from HF peaked during the winter months of December and January [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The distribution of monthly deaths differed by up to 35 percent when January was compared with August, which is when deaths were the lowest. Hospitalizations for HF followed the same seasonal pattern, with a winter-spring predominance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61776 \">figure 2</a>). Approximately one-fifth of the excess in winter admissions has been attributed to respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Circadian rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden death in patients with HF does not follow a circadian rhythm, in contrast to the circadian variation (most deaths between 6 AM and 12 PM) seen in the occurrence of out-of-hospital sudden death or acute myocardial infarction in the general population. An analysis of 1153 patients in the PRAISE trial found a uniform distribution of sudden death in patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy, while there was a PM peak in those with an ischemic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Although these trials provide strong evidence of benefit, trial participants are often younger and have fewer comorbidities than clinical patient populations and the conduct of care in trials differs from that in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Therefore, observational studies of process-of-care measures (including adherence to evidence-based therapies) have been performed to assess the effects on outcome in real world settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10444624\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence from clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from randomized trials has demonstrated the efficacy of certain drugs and devices in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as discussed in detail in the various topic reviews.

As an example, a meta-analysis of 21 trials involving 5849 patients treated for a median of six months found that beta blockers reduced overall mortality by 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It was estimated that during the first year this therapy would save 3.8 lives per 100 patients treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In the MERIT-HF trial of almost 4000 patients with NYHA class II to IV HF who were treated with ACE inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> produced a significant reduction in one-year mortality (7.2 versus 11 percent with placebo) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78949 \">figure 4A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The magnitude of benefit of combination therapy can be illustrated by the marked short-term improvement in survival of patients with NYHA class IV HF. In controlled trials, one-year mortality fell from 52 percent in the CONSENSUS trial published in 1987 in which ACE inhibitors and beta blockers were not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] to 11.4 percent in the COPERNICUS trial published in 2001 in which both drugs were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although it is not possible to compare these trials directly due to differences in entry criteria, the mortality rate in some groups of patients with advanced HF is now in the range of 15 to 25 percent. The observed improvement is due to the use of HF drugs (such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers) and other modalities aimed at underlying diseases (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, statins). </p><p>In addition to these specific therapies for HF, better control of hypertension and of coronary risk factors also contribute to the improvement in outcome.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are major lags in the appropriate adoption of drugs and devices that improve survival in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/4,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,48-50</a>]. Even among treated patients, the doses used are often lower than those in the clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

As an example, a single-center study of 6676 patients hospitalized for HF found that, over a 10-year period (1986 to 1996), there was reduction in observed in-hospital mortality from 8.4 to 6.1 percent (despite slight increase in predicted mortality) and reduction in adjusted length of hospital stay from 7.7 to 5.6 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>However, reductions in in-hospital mortality have been accompanied by lesser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] or no decrease in 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. An analysis of 2,540,838 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with HF between 2001 and December 2005 revealed reduction in observed in-hospital mortality from 5.1 to 4.2 percent although 30-day mortality was unchanged at 11 percent. Nearly one in four patients was readmitted within 30 days of the index hospitalization.</p><p>The 30-day mortality data demonstrate that the use of in-hospital mortality alone in evaluating HF prognosis can be misleading, especially when the length of hospital stay is declining and readmission rates are high. They also raise the concern that reduction in the length of stay after hospitalization for HF has had adverse consequences, possibly increasing early post-discharge mortality because a greater number of patients are discharged in an unstable condition. However, it is also possible that in the later years of the studies more terminally ill patients were being discharged from the hospital to die in other settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1442803866\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term mortality rates for patients with HF have improved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/20,52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,52-56</a>]. A decline in HF mortality was noted in an analysis from the Mayo Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. For the periods 1979 to 1984 compared with 1996 to 2000, the one-year mortality fell from 30 to 21 percent in men and from 20 to 17 percent in women. The five-year mortality fell from 65 to 50 percent in men and from 51 to 46 percent in women. Survival improved most among younger men and least among older women.</p><p>Lower rates of improvement in HF mortality rates were observed in two later studies of Medicare beneficiaries spanning shorter periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 3,957,520 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with HF between 1992 and 1999, the observed one-year mortality rate decreased only slightly (from 32.5 to 31.7 percent) during the study period due to a decline in mortality between 1993 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2,540,838 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with HF between 2001 and 2005, the observed one-year mortality rate (37 percent) did not fall over time, although the adjusted hazard of mortality at one-year was slightly lower in 2005 than in 2001 (hazard ratio 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p>Mortality rates in the placebo arms of clinical drug trials, which represent a selected population, have been variable, depending in large part upon the <strong>severity</strong> of the HF. In the placebo arms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trials of patients with systolic dysfunction, in which few patients were taking the two other drugs known to improve survival, beta blockers and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, the mortality rate was 52 percent at one year for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] compared with 25 percent at two years for NYHA class II to III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]; among patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of cardiovascular death or symptomatic HF was 39 percent at just over three years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62325%7ECARD%2F70015%7ECARD%2F75136\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62325 graphicRef70015 graphicRef75136 \">figure 3A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The entry criteria and selection biases explain the better outlook in these trials than in the population-based studies. Trial participants generally have fewer complicating illnesses, such as significant ischemic symptoms amenable to therapy or valve disease, fewer older patients, and are more likely to receive optimal therapy. As a result, trials are expected to overestimate survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2698187803\"><span class=\"h2\">Cause of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main causes of death in patients with HF are sudden death (defined as death within one hour of the onset of cardiovascular collapse in a previously stable patient) and progressive pump failure (defined as cardiac death with preceding symptomatic or hemodynamic deterioration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>]. Estimates suggest that progressive pump failure, sudden death, and sudden death during episodes of clinical worsening each account for approximately one-third of deaths in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Published series have categorized approximately 30 to 50 percent of all cardiac deaths in patients with HF as sudden deaths, with or without preceding symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/8,42,46,55,57,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,42,46,55,57,59,60</a>]. </p><p>However, classification of death as sudden or due to progressive HF is imperfect with overlapping mechanisms, and as a result, clinical studies have classified deaths in differing ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. It is often difficult to distinguish those dying suddenly and unexpectedly from those experiencing terminal arrhythmias in the setting of progressive hemodynamic deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/58,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,61,62</a>]. Ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation is a common cause of sudden death in HF. However, a bradyarrhythmia or pulseless electrical activity (electromechanical dissociation) is responsible for 5 to 33 percent or more of cases of sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], and even higher frequencies may be seen in patients with advanced HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>Evidence-based therapy for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) reduces mortality due to progressive HF as well as sudden death. As discussed separately, standard therapy for HFrEF includes beta blocker therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, each of which reduces overall mortality rates as well as risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). ACE inhibitors also reduce overall mortality and may also reduce SCD rates. Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy also reduces mortality and SCD rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Effect of HF therapy on ventricular arrhythmia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H547147053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Guideline-directed medical therapy'</a>.) </p><p>An analysis of data from 40,195 patients with HFrEF enrolled in 12 clinical trials with study periods spanning 1995 through 2014 examined the trend in risk of sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-heart-failure/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. There was a 44 percent decline in the rate of sudden death across the trials. The cumulative incidence of sudden death at 90 days after randomization was 2.4 percent in the earliest trial and 1 percent in the most recent trial. Overall mortality also trended downward across the trials (from approximately 15 to 10 percent per year; p = 0.059), and the proportion of overall mortality attributed to sudden death was similar across the trials (at approximately one-third). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
