In children, PH is most commonly associated with underlying cardiac or lung disease (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). PH may also be idiopathic or familial. Other causes of PH are rare in childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>). PH can be associated with considerable risk of morbidity and mortality.

Early referral is critical since treatment for many types of PH is less effective if provided at a late stage of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660409430\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following terms are used throughout this topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hypertension (PH)</strong> &ndash; PH refers to elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP; mean PAP &ge;25 mmHg). PH can be due to a primary elevation of pressure in the pulmonary arterial system alone, increased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation (eg, systemic-to-pulmonary shunting lesions), or elevation of pressure in the pulmonary veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transpulmonary gradient (TPG)</strong> &ndash; TPG is the pressure gradient across the pulmonary circulation. It is the difference between the mean PAP and the left atrial pressure (LAp).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)</strong> &ndash; PVR is a measurement of the resistance in the pulmonary circulation. It provides an estimation of whether the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is reduced (elevated PVR indicates reduced cross-section area). PVR is the ratio of the TPG to pulmonary blood flow (Qp): PVR = TPG <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> Qp (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-pulmonary-vascular-resistance-pvr-and-pulmonary-vascular-resistance-index-pvri\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Normal PVR is &le;1.5 Wood units, with Qp indexed to body surface area; mean PAP of 25 mmHg corresponds to PVR of approximately 4 to 5 Wood units, depending on Qp and LAp.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)</strong> &ndash; PAH refers to elevation of the pressure in the pulmonary arterial system (PAP &ge;25 mmHg) and elevated PVR with normal pulmonary venous pressure (pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP] &lt;15 mmHg). PH occurring in the context of certain underlying diseases (eg, lung disease) is not classified as PAH. (See <a href=\"#H3900385634\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH)</strong> &ndash; PVH refers to elevations of pressure in the pulmonary venous and pulmonary capillary systems (PAWP &ge;15 mmHg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD)</strong> &ndash; PHVD (previously called pulmonary vascular obstructive disease) refers to pathological remodeling of pulmonary small vessels that results in narrowing the vascular lumen and loss of small pulmonary vessels. PHVD is characterized by elevated PVR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TPG; PAP is typically elevated, but may be &lt;25 mmHg in some cases (eg, single ventricle with cavopulmonary palliation).</p><p/><p>Although there are important distinctions between the terms PH and PAH (as noted above), for simplicity, the term PH will be generally used in this topic review, except when the distinction is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3505450692\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children and infants &gt;3 months old, the definition of PH is the same as in adults: mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &ge;25 mmHg at sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This pressure cut-off for assigning the diagnosis of PH is somewhat arbitrary, and the concept of PH as being a disease (implying the need for therapy) is useful only when it acquires nuance. In addition to the PAP value, the following questions should be addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient old enough that the elevated PAP is not simply a slower than normal decline in fetal pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the elevation in PAP reflect an abnormal pulmonary vascular bed or is it secondary to increased flow or pulmonary venous pressure?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To what degree does the PH impact right ventricle (RV) function?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient disproportionately affected by a small increase in PAP?</p><p/><p>The following sections discuss these issues in greater detail:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neonates</strong> &ndash; PVR is high in utero and falls rapidly after birth. PAP normally reaches adult levels during the first few weeks of life. However, even if the PAP has fallen at the usual rate, the neonatal lung reacts to vasoconstrictive stimuli (eg, alveolar hypoxia) much more vigorously than does the mature lung, so stressors provoke a greater response than later in life. In addition, occasionally the neonatal transition to a low-resistance pulmonary circulation is delayed, and despite otherwise healthy lungs, the mean PAP remains elevated at &ge;25 mmHg (sometimes even suprasystemic). These asymptomatic neonates require close follow-up; however, in most cases the PH resolves over the first one to three months and they are generally not considered to have pathologic PH despite elevated PAP levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac shunting lesions or left heart disease</strong> &ndash; Patients with systemic-to-pulmonary cardiac shunting lesions may have PH due to increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp) rather than pulmonary vascular disease, per se. Similarly, left heart disease that is associated with elevated left atrial pressure (LAp) (eg, left ventricular [LV] failure, cardiomyopathy, mitral or aortic valve stenosis or other LV obstructive lesions) may cause PH due to pressure &quot;back-up&quot; (ie, pulmonary venous hypertension [PVH]). Patients in these categories may actually have healthy pulmonary vessels, or reversible pulmonary vascular abnormalities. Defining PH solely on the basis of only the PAP fails to take into account the amount of Qp or pulmonary venous pressure as a determinant of PAP. By contrast, the PVR takes these variables into consideration (PVR = [mean PAP &ndash; mean <span class=\"nowrap\">LAp]/Qp)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3660409430\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Right ventricular function</strong> &ndash; The RV is the primary end organ of interest in PH. Elevated PAP is mostly relevant insofar as it impacts RV systolic and diastolic function (ie, its capacity to generate blood flow) at rest and with exercise. A mean PAP considerably exceeding 25 mmHg may be well-tolerated in a patient whose RV is well-adapted to high pressure. Conversely, a seemingly minor increase in PVR may have critical impact on RV function in certain patients, even with mean PAP levels that are &lt;25 mmHg mean. For patients with single ventricle physiology (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome) and cavopulmonary palliation (eg, Fontan palliation) there is no pump to drive blood across the pulmonary circulation and a relatively minor increase in PVR can severely compromise cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conditions at time of measurement</strong> &ndash; Measurements of PAP in the echocardiography or cardiac catheterization laboratory may not reflect the PAP at other times and under different conditions. For example, patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may have little elevation of PAP when healthy, but a marked and clinically important increase in the setting of viral respiratory infection. In addition, patients with PH have relatively noncompliant pulmonary vascular beds, so a modestly elevated PAP at rest (with no appreciable impact on the patient's physiology) can increase substantially with exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132218691\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is caused by one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased pulmonary blood flow (Qp)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased pulmonary venous pressure (most commonly due to elevated left atrial pressure [LAp])</p><p/><p>As previously noted, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) provides an estimation of whether the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is reduced (elevated PVR indicates reduced cross-section area). Reduced cross-sectional area is due to reduced luminal diameter of small pulmonary vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decreased number of these vessels. In most types of PH, small pulmonary arteries (PAs) are most effected, although small or large pulmonary veins may be the primary site of obstruction in some forms of PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis involves larger PAs and can also cause PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The number of small PAs may also be reduced by virtue of complete occlusion of the lumen by neointimal cells or by in situ thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A paucity of small PAs can also result from the failure of such vessels to develop (eg, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD] or, possibly, high <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/high</span> flow cardiac defects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Medial hypertrophy can resolve when the inciting stimulus is removed (eg, repair of a large ventricular septal defect in the first year of life), but intimal proliferation and connective tissue deposition have much less potential to resolve with therapy.</p><p/><p>A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of why and how disease occurs in pulmonary blood vessels is lacking, but a considerable amount of knowledge about the pathogenesis has been gained through translational and laboratory investigations. Factors that may contribute to the development of PHVD include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmental abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Abnormal pulmonary vascular development, occurring pre- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postnatally can cause increased PVR.

In addition, some of the groupings are quite broad and lack a consistent clinical or biological theme (groups 1 and 5); while others are fairly tightly-themed (groups 2, 3, and 4).</p><p>It has long been appreciated that the WSPH classification is insufficient for pediatric PH, which often is related to fetal and developmental abnormalities, and can have very different clinical characteristics from that seen in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In 2011, an expert panel formulated an alternative classification for childhood PH (the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3161725/table/T2/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ooto49V8oKzn1JEK6lhPkydekAScM4XWRQUV5i4gcPvr1JWWo1RQ6s/vauPxaeO0WOOW1I/mXsZC3K1nw59rPeATs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17234\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Panama classification</a>) that incorporates many forms of pediatric vascular disease not accounted for in the WSPH classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

PH is well-described in children with collagen vascular disease, liver disease, and acute thromboembolism, but these diseases are rare causes of PH in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H756869226\"><span class=\"h2\">PPHN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is usually transient in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. PPHN is discussed separately.

The two broad categories of CHD that can cause PH include shunting lesions and left heart disease associated with elevated left atrial pressure (LAp).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic-to-pulmonary shunting</strong> &ndash; By definition, PH occurs in any defect that by virtue of its size and location exposes the pulmonary circulation to systemic-level arterial pressure. Large ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most common example of this. In infants with such lesions, the right ventricle (RV) is usually well adapted to high pressure and thus the elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), per se, is of little consequence in the short term, though they may have symptoms of congestive heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">From the point of view of the pulmonary circulation, the greater significance of unrepaired high-pressure shunting defects is that, during the first year or two, the patient may develop high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PVHD), which can be irreversible and progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. PH can persist and increase in patients after closure of intracardiac shunts, especially when closed late. If PVR increases to systemic or greater levels, unrepaired defects that are typically acyanotic (eg, VSD, patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], atrial septal defect [ASD]) may become cyanotic by virtue of shunt reversal. This is referred to as Eisenmenger syndrome. In addition to cyanosis, potential complications of Eisenmenger syndrome include stroke, renal insufficiency, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, polycythemia, and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

By contrast, ASDs are associated with low-pressure shunting (at least initially) and they very infrequently lead to PH during childhood; when PH develops, it typically occurs only after the first two decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Unlike VSDs and PDAs, the timing of ASD repair (when indicated) is usually after the first year of life.

The magnitude of elevation of PAP is highly variable: In some patients, PAP is increased only to the same degree as the LAp, but in a substantial minority PAP is increased to a much greater degree than LAp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary vein stenosis</strong> &ndash; Pulmonary vein stenosis is an uncommon cause of PH.

Maldevelopment of pulmonary blood vessels underlies PH in this setting, and the vascular bed is especially prone to vasoconstriction with viral infection or other stresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most patients with PH due to BPD are only mildly to moderately affected, especially when healthy, and PAP generally falls with growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-in-children-classification-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

However, the number of conditions associated with PH is growing and too numerous to comprehensively list here. In patients with these conditions, PH may develop as a result of cardiac or pulmonary disease associated with the syndrome (eg, airway abnormalities, chronic aspiration, disordered breathing, restrictive lung disease from neuromuscular weakness or scoliosis) or PH may be due to genetic factors resulting from chromosomal abnormalities.

(See <a href=\"#H968084410\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing is performed to evaluate functional capacity, to better evaluate RV size and function (if not adequately assessed with echocardiography), and to identify the underlying etiology of PH if a cause is not identified in the initial evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation is guided by the clinical findings. A thorough cardiopulmonary assessment is required in all patients. For patients without a known predisposing condition, a comprehensive evaluation is required. (See <a href=\"#H2614542915\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of PH can be established on the basis of echocardiography showing quantitatively or qualitatively elevated RV pressure. Definitive diagnosis of PH requires cardiac catheterization; mean PAP &ge;25 mmHg confirms the diagnosis.
