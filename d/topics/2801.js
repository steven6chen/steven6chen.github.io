Invasive infection of the kidney is unusual and is difficult to treat. The vast majority of fungal infections of the kidney and bladder result from <em>Candida albicans</em> and other <em>Candida </em>species. A variety of other fungi can rarely involve the kidney as a result of disseminated infection. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Aspergillus</em> species</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Fusarium</em> species</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Trichosporon</em> species</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucorales (eg, <em>Rhizopus</em>, <em>Mucor </em>species)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dematiaceous molds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dimorphic fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides </em>species, <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>, <em>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</em>, <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em>, and <em>Penicillium marneffei</em>)</p><p/><p>A review of <em>Candida</em> infections of the bladder and kidney will be presented here. Issues related to fungal peritonitis in patients treated with continuous peritoneal dialysis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal peritonitis in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two mechanisms by which <em>Candida</em> spp infect the urinary tract: infections can begin in the lower urinary tract and ascend to the upper urinary tract, and infection can also occur via hematogenous dissemination to the kidneys.</p><p>Mice or rabbits infected intravenously with fungi clear these organisms quickly from their bloodstream. Despite this ability, fungal multiplication is commonly found within the kidney, the only organ in which this appears to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whether fungi preferentially localize in the kidney or are cleared from other organs more efficiently by host defense mechanisms is not understood.</p><p>In these animal models, the two key steps in the pathogenesis of fungal renal infection are the attachment of fungi to endothelial surfaces and penetration into tissue. Within five minutes of injection, yeast forms are found in the capillary beds of the kidneys. Since this elicits an inflammatory response, yeasts survive only if they penetrate the capillary walls and invade the interstitium. Invasion is expedited by attachment to the capillary walls via adherence mechanisms. Penetration through the capillary walls is facilitated by the formation of pseudohyphal or hyphal forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Ascending infection of the kidneys is thought to result from vesicoureteral reflux of fungi from the bladder. However, this mechanism is difficult to demonstrate in animal models. The presence of an indwelling bladder catheter is associated with biofilm formation, and this allows persistent colonization by <em>Candida</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candiduria is a common event in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A European observational study found that <em>Candida</em> was the third most common organism isolated from urine in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A prospective multicenter surveillance study evaluated 861 hospitalized patients with candiduria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <em>Candida albicans</em> was found in 52 percent of these patients and <em>Candida glabrata</em> in 16 percent. The following risk factors were noted: urinary tract drainage devices (83 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (90 percent), diabetes (39 percent), urinary tract pathology (38 percent), and malignancy (22 percent). Only 11 percent had no underlying predisposing factors for funguria. Urinary tract infections associated with drainage devices, diabetes, or urinary tract abnormalities are considered complicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Candiduria is especially common among patients in intensive care units (ICUs); older age, diabetes mellitus, length of stay, ventilator support, and parenteral nutrition were found to be risk factors in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other studies have noted similar risk factors in ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Community-based studies have been reported infrequently, but they generally note similar risk factors (eg, diabetes, antimicrobial use, indwelling bladder catheters) as those in hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION VERSUS COLONIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with candiduria are asymptomatic, and the yeasts merely represent colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is difficult to differentiate between colonization and bladder infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infected patients may have dysuria, frequency, and suprapubic discomfort, but others have no symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyuria is so common in patients with a chronic indwelling bladder catheter that it cannot be used to indicate infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neither the presence of pseudohyphae in the urine nor the number of colonies growing in culture (unlike bacterial urine cultures) help to distinguish colonization from infection.</p><p/><p>The diagnostic modalities used to distinguish infection from colonization are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several concerns in patients with asymptomatic candiduria: the development of ascending infection of the kidney, the development of candidemia, and the possibility that candiduria is a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis. These complications should be considered in the appropriate host:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascending involvement of the kidneys usually occurs in the setting of urinary tract obstruction, which may be caused by formation of fungus balls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Complications of upper tract infection, such as emphysematous pyelonephritis and papillary necrosis, are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candiduria as a source of candidemia typically occurs in patients who have urinary tract abnormalities, most often urinary tract obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in those who have undergone a urinary tract procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Candidemia as a consequence of asymptomatic candiduria without obstruction or surgery is uncommon in hospitalized patients, including those in the intensive care unit setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The kidneys are the most commonly involved organ in disseminated candidiasis. Although candiduria can be seen in systemic infection, it is usually accompanied by many other signs and symptoms of disseminated infection.</p><p/><p>Renal transplantation was previously thought to be a risk factor for ascending infection and candidemia when candiduria was present. A nested case-control study of 192 renal transplant recipients who developed candiduria was performed to assess the epidemiology of candiduria in a large population of 1738 transplant recipients over an eight-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The study demonstrated the following results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for developing candiduria were similar to those described for non-transplant patients in prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidemia occurred in only 5 percent of patients with candiduria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with an antifungal agent did not result in a greater likelihood of clearing <em>Candida </em>from the urine when compared with simple catheter removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although patients with candiduria had worse survival compared to those without candiduria, treatment of candiduria was not associated with a survival benefit.</p><p/><p>A limitation of this study is that it did not address some of the specific questions that arise in kidney transplant recipients who have asymptomatic candiduria early after transplantation when ureteral stents are in place. During this time period, ureteral obstruction from fungus balls and allograft pyelonephritis has been described. Further study is necessary to address the utility of antifungal therapy in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical characteristics of kidney infections depend on whether the disease presents secondary to candidemia or from an ascending bladder infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidemia-associated infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the kidney associated with candidemia is usually bilateral, consisting of multiple microabscesses in the cortex and medulla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52139 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The kidney is the most common organ involved in systemic <em>Candida</em> infections. This was illustrated in a review of 45 autopsies of patients with disseminated candidiasis: 40 had histological evidence of renal involvement compared with 26 with evidence of invasion of the heart, the next most commonly involved organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>When present, symptoms and signs referable to renal infection include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flank <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Costovertebral angle tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal tenderness</p><p/><p>In contrast, kidney infection in premature neonates may be associated with severe manifestations; polymorphonuclear leukocytes in these hosts may not ingest and kill the yeast normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candida-infection-in-neonates#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a>.)</p><p>Renal function is only rarely compromised in adults. In neonates, however, there seems to be a higher propensity for fungus ball formation with resulting obstruction and serious renal impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Papillary necrosis can occur, and the sloughed papillae may serve as a nidus for fungus ball formation. Although it is uncommon for <em>Candida</em> to invade vascular structures and cause infarction, there are reports of renal infarction secondary to emboli in patients with <em>Candida</em> endocarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ascending infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascending <em>Candida</em> infection of the kidney usually has a subacute to chronic course. Invasion of the renal parenchyma in such patients tends to involve the renal pelvis and medulla with sparing of the cortex. The kidney is usually the only organ involved and the infection tends to be unilateral. Fungus balls and perinephric abscesses can occur, as can emphysematous pyelonephritis; the latter complication occurs rarely. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is characterized on imaging by air in the collecting system or renal parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emphysematous urinary tract infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ascending infections occur mostly in patients with diabetes or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract. Among diabetic patients, abnormalities, such as an atonic bladder and glucosuria, promote the chronic presence of fungi in the urinary tract.</p><p>Predisposing urinary tract abnormalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal stones causing obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal stone manipulation with percutaneous lithotripsy or ureteroscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrostomy tubes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostatic hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic bladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infected penile prosthesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic bladder catheterization</p><p/><p>Flank pain may be present for days to weeks and costovertebral angle tenderness can be elicited in some patients. Fever or other signs of systemic infection are usually absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When only isolated candiduria is found, it can be difficult to distinguish among contamination of the urine sample, colonization of the bladder, local bladder infection, and upper tract disease involving the renal parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>].</p><p>Urine characteristics, such as the number of yeast or the presence of pyuria, do not distinguish fungal colonization from fungal infection. Although uncommonly found, the identification of fungal casts in urine cytology specimens stained with periodic acid-Schiff or silver stains is diagnostic of kidney involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Since the kidneys are seeded from the bladder, blood cultures are generally negative for fungi.</p><p>Persistent candiduria, especially in diabetics, should prompt radiologic imaging of the kidneys with ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) to evaluate for renal involvement. Abdominal CT scans or sonography may show hydronephrosis, fungus balls, or perinephric abscesses associated with ascending infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Patients with candiduria who have systemic signs or symptoms should be evaluated for disseminated infection with imaging and blood cultures. Among patients with known disseminated candidiasis, the finding of renal involvement has no specific treatment implications unless renal function deteriorates or flank pain develops.</p><p>The diagnosis of patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Updated Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of candidiasis were published in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and a literature review summarizing the treatment of <em>Candida</em> urinary tract infections was published in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These recommendations, along with our treatment suggestions, are summarized in the following discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic candiduria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic candiduria rarely requires antifungal therapy unless it occurs in the setting of a condition that confers high risk of dissemination (neutropenia, very low birthweight infants (&lt;1500 g), or urinary tract manipulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Antifungal therapy is <strong>not</strong> recommended unless the patient belongs to one of the groups listed above.</p><p>In contrast, patients who have a risk factor for disseminated infection should be treated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenic patients and very low birthweight infants (&lt;1500 g) with asymptomatic candiduria should be assumed to have disseminated infection and should be treated with an antifungal regimen recommended for candidemia.

Candiduria is most often treated in renal transplant recipients when there is a high risk for graft or device involvement, such as early after transplant when ureteral stents are in place.</p><p>Imaging of the urinary system should be considered in patients who have persistent candiduria and who may be at increased risk for formation of fungus balls. This includes diabetics, those who have other urologic abnormalities that may predispose to fungus ball formation, and neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Among asymptomatic patients without these risk factors, antifungal therapy has not been proven to be of value because rapid recurrence is common, selection of resistant <em>Candida</em> species is possible, and clinical outcomes do not appear to be improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31-33</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, double-blind trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> to placebo in 316 patients with candiduria and minimal or no symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Fluconazole therapy resulted in a significantly higher rate of eradication of the organism (50 versus 29 percent overall), especially for those who received 14 days of therapy and did not have a urinary catheter in place (78 versus 47 percent). However, cultures obtained 14 days after completion of treatment showed no difference between the groups; candiduria was present in 32 percent of those who had received fluconazole and 35 percent of placebo recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid recurrence of funguria after antifungal therapy is discontinued (82 percent at 30 days) was also noted in another randomized trial in which oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> was compared to bladder irrigation with amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, multicenter observational study cited above evaluated 861 hospitalized patients with funguria, almost all due to <em>Candida</em> species and almost all with asymptomatic funguria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinical outcome data were available for 530 patients. Resolution of funguria occurred in 76 percent of patients who received no specific antifungal therapy, 35 percent of patients who were treated with urinary catheter removal alone, and 50 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or amphotericin B bladder wash.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The overall mortality was 20 percent, but only seven patients (1.3 percent) developed candidemia.

If complete removal of bladder catheters or urologic stents is not possible, placement of new devices or intermittent bladder catheterization may decrease colonization.</p><p>A review of 243 patients with asymptomatic candiduria at four United States medical centers found that 43 percent were treated inappropriately with antifungal agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic candiduria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic candiduria should be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>].

Invasive infection of the kidney is unusual and is difficult to treat. The vast majority of fungal infections of the kidney and bladder result from <em>Candida albicans</em> and other <em>Candida </em>species. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for candiduria include urinary tract drainage devices, prior antibiotic therapy, diabetes, urinary tract pathology, and malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with candiduria are asymptomatic, and the yeasts merely represent colonization.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Infection versus colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical characteristics of fungal kidney infections depend on whether the disease is secondary to hematogenous spread or from ascending infection of the bladder. When present, symptoms and signs referable to renal infection include flank <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and abdominal tenderness. Papillary necrosis can occur and the sloughed papillae may serve as a nidus for fungus ball formation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above.) Fungus balls and perinephric abscesses can occur.
