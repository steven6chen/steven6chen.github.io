These recommendations advise no more than two drinks daily for men and one drink daily for nonpregnant women. The reasons for this gender difference include the lower body size, percentage of body weight composed of water, and activity of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase among women, resulting in heavier effective alcohol exposure for a given level of drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>However, no level of alcohol consumption can reliably be regarded as safe for some patients.

This finding has been observed in prospective studies from around the world, including the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/19,20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,23</a>], Great Britain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], Trinidad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], among many others. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the mortality curve for alcohol consumption shifts according to the drinking habits of the country studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, not all studies have found a mortality benefit. In a study in the United Kingdom, the beneficial association between mortality and low-intensity alcohol consumption was found to be attenuated when adjusted for potential confounders, particularly after former drinkers were excluded from the analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies in older adults have found mixed results. In a study of over 24,000 United States adults &gt;50 years, no level of alcohol consumption was associated with reduced all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, another study in United States adults &gt;55 years, moderate drinkers (one <span class=\"nowrap\">drink/day)</span> had a lower mortality compared with abstainers (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>For nonpregnant women and patients without other comorbidities, the healthiest dose of alcohol has not been determined. Based on the available evidence, the ideal dose of alcohol for mortality benefit is likely around 6 grams (about one-half of a standard drink) per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56818 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H159190429\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>A 2006 meta-analysis of 34 studies found that mortality was lowest at an intake of approximately 6 grams per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although the benefit was equally strong among men and women, the dose associated with lowest mortality was lower in women than men (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> and 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day,</span> respectively). Women who drank up to two glasses of an alcoholic beverage daily, and men who drank up to four glasses, had lower mortality than people who had never consumed alcohol. Twenty-six of the studies were from populations outside the United States, and the effects of alcohol vary in different geographical locations.</p><p>In the largest single study of alcohol and mortality, the maximal benefit occurred at a consumption of one drink daily for both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, a study of 86,000 nurses found mortality to be lowest among those women consuming one to three drinks per week (risk ratio [RR] 0.83 compared with abstainers), slightly lower than the mortality for women consuming up to two drinks daily (RR = 0.88 compared with abstainers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A 2013 meta-analysis of 18 cohort studies found that, compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">non/occasional</span> drinkers, the pooled relative risks (RR) for cancer mortality for men who were light, moderate, and heavy drinkers were 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.94), 1.02 (CI 0.99-1.06), and 1.31 (CI 1.23-1.39), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] The same relationship was not found in women. A subsequent prospective cohort study of health professionals in the United States that included over 88,000 women and 47,000 men followed for 30 years found that, compared with nondrinkers, light and moderate drinkers had a small but nonsignificant increase in cancer risk, regardless of smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, for women who had never smoked, there was an increased risk of alcohol-related cancer (defined as colorectum, female breast, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, liver, and esophagus) even with one alcoholic drink a day (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.20), mainly driven by an increased risk for breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is consistent evidence that breast cancer risk is higher for women consuming both low (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">drink/day)</span> to high (&ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">drinks/day)</span> levels of alcohol compared with abstainers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. There appears to be a significant dose response relationship beginning with intakes as low as three to six drinks per week.

There was a 10 percent increase in risk with each 10 grams per day of alcohol intake. Breast cancer risk was linearly correlated with cumulative lifetime alcohol intake and was most strongly associated with drinking patterns in both early and later adult life. In addition, an analysis of breast cancer incidence among 38,500 women participating in the Women's Health Study, daily alcohol intake again was shown to modestly increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The relative risk for each 10 gram increase in daily alcohol intake was 1.11 (95% CI 1.03-1.20) for estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer; the difference in risk was not statistically significant for ER- and PR-negative breast cancer. There has also been an association with alcohol consumption and luminal A and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The proportion of breast cancer cases attributed to alcohol intake varies widely.

In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study in over 250,000 women in eight European countries, the attributable risk for breast cancer was 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Since most of the trauma risk associated with alcohol is acute, exposure to alcohol is generally measured in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rather than drinks per day or week.

Our knowledge of the effects of moderate alcohol consumption in humans is derived primarily from two sources: short-term trials analyzing the effect of alcohol on physiological measures and observational studies comparing moderate drinkers with abstainers. Both of these sources have limitations.</p><p>While short-term trials of alcohol intake are more easily controlled, they focus on intermediate measures (such as hemostatic parameters, lipid levels, or cognitive function) rather than disease outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/167-169\" class=\"abstract_t\">167-169</a>]. They also do not inform about the balance between alcohol's long-term risks and benefits since alcohol use extends over decades. Furthermore, these trials tend to be performed using healthy, young, white, male subjects, and the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other populations.</p><p>The main limitation of long-term observational studies that compare abstainers with alcohol users is that alcohol use is not distributed randomly among individuals. Simply adjusting for known, measurable differences between abstainers and drinkers may be inadequate to make the two groups comparable. People who abstain are different than those who drink in more ways than how much alcohol they consume. Studies that compare abstainers with other drinkers may be confounded by the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cessation of drinking with illness</strong> &ndash; Whether they realize it or not, people who are ill may stop drinking. Thus, the group of healthy abstainers may be diluted with former drinkers at high risk for illness and death. The British Regional Heart Study found that a large proportion of abstainers were former drinkers with high rates of high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis, and coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. Also, patients with a wide range of chronic diseases may avoid alcohol to prevent medication interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inclusion of former alcoholics</strong> &ndash; People who remain in remission from alcoholism rarely return to social drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. They are more likely to completely abstain from alcohol. People may not admit to former alcoholism as the reason behind their current abstention, since alcoholism carries a strong social stigma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abstention as an indicator of underlying emotional or physical problems</strong> &ndash; The decision to avoid alcohol may itself reflect important facts about one's physical and emotional health. Observational data suggest that abstainers differ from drinkers well before differences in specific diseases emerge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a prospective study of men from adolescence into older age, 33 percent of lifelong abstainers had poor physical health in childhood compared with 14 percent of moderate drinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. In addition, only 16 percent of abstainers came from warm childhood homes versus 35 percent of moderate drinkers. Similarly, an analysis of 9605 individuals at age 33 demonstrated that abstainers had double the risk of psychological distress or limiting illness than light or moderate drinkers, regardless of gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate alcohol use may indicate resistance to alcoholism</strong> &ndash; People who successfully drink in moderation are, by definition, not abusers of alcohol. They have undergone a &quot;diagnostic challenge&quot; for alcoholism and passed. The same cannot be said for lifelong abstainers. If abstainers were to initiate alcohol consumption, some would develop problem drinking. It may be difficult to generalize the results of observational studies comparing moderate drinkers and abstainers. This problem does not apply to studies comparing infrequent with moderate drinkers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inaccuracies of reported alcohol use</strong> &ndash; Typically, these studies classify subjects based on self-reported alcohol intake, with potential inaccuracy in the reporting of alcohol exposure. Additionally, subjects may change their drinking patterns over the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. Although alcohol consumption is still much better reported than many other dietary factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>], inaccuracy limits our ability to identify optimal or safe levels of drinking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confounding by other lifestyle factors</strong> &ndash; Multiple lifestyle factors (eg, educational status, tobacco use, exercise, diet) are associated with patterns of alcohol use and thus confound the results when alcohol intake is presumed to be linked to a particular outcome. Most studies attempt to adjust for known confounders, but it is difficult to identify or correct for all confounding factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A review of data from over 250,000 respondents to the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) compared cardiovascular disease-associated risk factors in moderate drinkers (two drinks per day for men and one drink or fewer per day for women) with nondrinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. Nondrinkers had significantly higher rates of multiple known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including no leisure-time physical activity, low overall physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index (BMI) &gt;30, and fair or poor overall health status. However, many of these differences were attenuated or even reversed when adjusting for basic demographic differences between abstainers and drinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, moderate alcohol use is more common among those with higher socioeconomic status. Because of the profound effect of socioeconomic status on health, its potential for confounding the observed effect of alcohol is considerable. In one study, current drinkers were 15 to 25 percent more likely to have attended school beyond grade 12 than were lifelong nondrinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-risks-and-benefits-of-alcohol-consumption/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
