The kidneys are organs in the urinary tract that make urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Each kidney has 2 parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that filters the blood and removes waste and excess salt and water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A part that collects urine</p><p/><p>In glomerular disease, the part of the kidney that filters the blood doesn't work normally. As a result, substances that shouldn't be in the urine, such as blood and protein, can get into the urine.</p><p>Glomerular disease can happen quickly or slowly over time. There are different types of glomerular disease, and each type has different causes.</p><p>Sometimes glomerular disease causes serious problems. It can cause acute kidney failure, which is when the kidneys suddenly stop working. It can also cause chronic kidney disease, which is when the kidneys slowly stop working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14390952\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of glomerular disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the type of glomerular disease you have and what's causing it. Some people with glomerular disease have no symptoms. They find out they have it when their doctor does a urine test for another reason.</p><p>When glomerular disease causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody urine or urine that is red, pink, or brown</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the hands, face, feet, or belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating less than usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14390967\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for glomerular disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can check for glomerular disease by doing blood and urine tests. These tests can show if your urine has blood or protein in it, and how well your kidneys are working.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will probably do other tests to find out which type of glomerular disease you have. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for medical conditions that can cause glomerular disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound of your kidney &ndash; An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A kidney biopsy &ndash; During a biopsy, the doctor will put a thin needle into your back and into your kidney. He or she will remove a tiny sample of tissue from the kidney. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14390982\"><span class=\"h1\">How is glomerular disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms, what's causing your glomerular disease, and how quickly it happened.</p><p>People with mild glomerular disease might not need treatment. But their doctor will do blood and urine tests over time to follow their condition.</p><p>Some types of glomerular disease go away on their own. For instance, people can get glomerular disease after they have an infection in another part of their body. This type of glomerular disease usually goes away after the infection is treated.</p><p>When glomerular disease does need to be treated, treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called steroids &ndash; These steroids are different from the ones athletes take to build muscle. These medicines can come as pills or go into a vein through a tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong medicines that partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclophosphamide</a> (brand name: Procytox) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">azathioprine</a> (sample brand names: Azasan, Imuran) &ndash; These medicines (also called &quot;immunosuppressive medicines&quot;) can be taken along with steroid medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that treat high blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;diuretics&quot; that make people urinate a lot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmapheresis &ndash; For this treatment, a machine pumps blood from your body and filters out substances that are harming your kidney. Then the machine returns the blood to your body.</p><p/><p>People whose kidneys have stopped working might need other treatment called &quot;renal replacement therapy.&quot; Renal replacement therapy includes 3 different treatments that can do the work of the kidneys. These treatments are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis &ndash; Hemodialysis is a procedure in which a machine pumps blood out of the body, filters it, and returns it to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 2</a>). People have hemodialysis at least 3 times a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal dialysis &ndash; Peritoneal dialysis is a procedure that people do at home every day. It involves piping a special fluid through a tube into the belly. This fluid collects waste and excess salt and water from the blood. Then the used fluid drains out of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71539 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney transplant &ndash; A kidney transplant is surgery in which a doctor puts a healthy kidney in a person whose kidneys are diseased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59957\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59957 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14390997\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
