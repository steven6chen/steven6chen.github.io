A pelvic fracture is when a person breaks his or her pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83511 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of pelvic fractures, depending on the part of the pelvis that breaks and how it breaks.</p><p>Some pelvic fractures happen after falls or sports injuries. But most pelvic fractures happen from car accidents or other severe injuries. In these cases, the injury causing the pelvic fracture can also damage organs, nerves, and blood vessels near the pelvis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668140\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a pelvic fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a pelvic fracture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or pain when walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or loss of feeling in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668155\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a pelvic fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests to check for a pelvic fracture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An X-ray of the pelvis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test of the pelvis, such as a CT scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668170\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a pelvic fracture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of pelvic fracture you have and how severe it is.</p><p>A mild pelvic fracture is usually treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and the skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice up to 2 days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crutches or a walker to help with walking</p><p/><p>Right after an injury, doctors usually treat a severe pelvic fracture by putting a splint or other binding material around the pelvis to hold it in place.</p><p>Then a severe pelvic fracture is treated with surgery to put the pelvis back in the correct position. During surgery, the doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use screws, pins, rods, or plates to fix the bone inside the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put pins or screws through the skin and into the bone, and then attach the pins or screws to a bar that is outside the skin</p><p/><p>Treatment for a pelvic fracture also includes medicine to treat the pain. Doctors can prescribe a strong pain medicine if people have a lot of pain or a severe fracture. For mild fractures, doctors usually recommend that people take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>After surgery and after your bones are mostly healed, you will work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she will teach you exercises to make the muscles around your pelvis stronger. He or she will also work with you on bending, walking, and climbing stairs so you can move normally again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668185\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does a pelvic fracture take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pelvic fracture usually takes months to heal, depending on the fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668200\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. Plus, doctors usually recommend that people with a fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668238\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your leg gets swollen or you see red streaks on your leg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have chest pain, trouble breathing, or dizziness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid or pus drains out of the cut from your surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get an open sore on your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867668253\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-falls-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing falls (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
