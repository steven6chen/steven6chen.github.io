The etiology of this syndrome is poorly understood, but early diagnosis and treatment are critical to limit the morbidity of the disorder.</p><p>Childhood-onset schizophrenia usually represents a more severe form of the disorder, with more prominent prepsychotic developmental disorders, structural brain abnormalities, and genetic risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-schizophrenia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>This topic reviews our approach to selecting treatments for schizophrenia in children and adolescents. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for schizophrenia in children and adolescents are reviewed separately.

There are clinical trials supporting their effectiveness for treating schizophrenia in adults, but few trials for schizophrenia in youth and no trials testing their efficacy in preventing or slowing functional deterioration in youth with prodromal symptoms. In our clinical experience, however, skills training and individual psychotherapy can be helpful in slowing the deterioration of cognitive functioning and skill attainment in youth with prodromal symptoms. Cognitive enhancement therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis may also be helpful, if available, but these interventions are most commonly provided in major academic medical centers.
