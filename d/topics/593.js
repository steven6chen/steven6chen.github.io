It usually happens in people who have asthma or cystic fibrosis. These lung conditions make it hard to breathe.</p><p>People who get ABPA are allergic to a fungus called &quot;aspergillus.&quot; This allergy is more serious than an allergy to pollen or pets. ABPA can cause scars to form inside the lungs. This can make asthma or other conditions worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93365615\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ABPA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing up mucus with brown specks in it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing or noisy breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick</p><p/><p>A few people who get ABPA cough up blood, but not everyone does.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93365630\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are coughing up blood, call your doctor or nurse. <strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you have a severe asthma attack and your symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not get better after using a quick-relief medicine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93365645\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. He or she can also order the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray &ndash; This might show changes in the lungs caused by ABPA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan of the chest &ndash; This is an imaging test that uses a special X-ray to create pictures of the inside of the body. It can show more details than a regular X-ray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests &ndash; For these tests, you breathe hard into a tube. The tests show how well your lungs are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin test &ndash; In this test, the doctor or nurse will put a tiny bit of an extract of aspergillus on your skin. Then he or she will make a tiny prick in the skin. The aspergillus is not alive, and it has been treated so it cannot make you sick. After 15 or 20 minutes, you might get a red, itchy bump like a mosquito bite. If you do, it means you are allergic to the fungus and ABPA might be causing your symptoms. If you do not get a bump, you probably do not have ABPA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood test &ndash; This can show if your body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; shows signs of an allergy to aspergillus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93365662\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ABPA treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABPA is treated with medicines. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines, such as prednisone (brand name: PredniSONE) &ndash; Steroids help reduce inflammation in the lungs. These are not the same steroids that athletes take to build up muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to kill the fungus that causes aspergillosis &ndash; These include itraconazole (brand name: Sporanox) or voriconazole (brand name: VFEND).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma medicines &ndash; Most people also need medicines to treat their asthma. There are several different types of medicine used to treat asthma. Many of them come in inhaler devices.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests every month or two to see if the ABPA is getting better. You might also have X-rays to check your lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93365677\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cystic fibrosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
