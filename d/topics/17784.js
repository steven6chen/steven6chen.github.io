This accumulation of neoplastic cells typically results in splenomegaly; a variable reduction in the production of normal red blood cells, platelets, mature granulocytes, and monocytes; and complications of anemia, bleeding, and infection.</p><p>The treatment of HCL will be reviewed here; clinical features and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

Otherwise, a period of observation is recommended.</p><p>During this observation period, the frequency of visits depends on the severity and tempo of disease. Most patients can be seen in clinic every three months for the first year and then every three to six months thereafter until indications for therapy arise. At these appointments we perform a history, physical examination, and a complete blood count with differential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2946334293\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, infection has been a major cause of death in patients with HCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These patients have an increased risk of infection due to a combination of disease-related immunosuppression (eg, neutropenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monocytopenia) and treatment-related immunosuppression. In addition to increased rates of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, patients with HCL appear to be at increased risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The following specific issues related to infectious complications are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purine analogs suppress immune effector cells and induce a profound neutropenia and prolonged lymphopenia.

However, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination, and immunization with live virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains. Most patients with HCL should be vaccinated with inactivated vaccines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a>), as indicated. Those receiving chemotherapy should <strong>not</strong> receive live virus vaccines (eg, vaccines for varicella; measles, mumps, rubella; measles, rubella, and varicella; and zoster). Further details, including the appropriate timing of vaccination in patients with cancer, are discussed separately.

Most patients with HCL-v are poorly responsive or resistant to standard treatment (ie, splenectomy, interferon, purine analogs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Although treatment data are sparse, patients with HCL-v are candidates for treatment with monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, moxetumomab pasudotox, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For most patients with HCL-v, we suggest either five daily infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a> or seven days of continuous infusion cladribine, each followed approximately one month later by eight weekly treatments of rituximab. The choice between the five- and seven-day schedules can be based on feasibility in the clinic and clinician preferences.

Durable responses are seen in &gt;90 percent of patients with a median progression-free survival of 9 to 11 years. Because of ease of administration, we often prefer a single cycle of cladribine. For most patients with HCL, we offer either five daily infusions of cladribine or seven days of continuous infusion cladribine. The choice between the five and seven day schedules can be based on feasibility in the clinic and clinician preferences. Our contributors differ in their preferred management following initial treatment with cladribine with one offering observation and the other offering a short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> consolidation.

Treatment with standard dose purine analogs is not suggested in the setting of active infection since it is associated with a decline in neutrophils prior to hematologic recovery.

Both drugs induce durable complete remissions (CRs) in the overwhelming majority of patients with HCL. Equally high rates of durable CRs are achieved with these two agents in both untreated and previously treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] and those with large or minimal tumor burdens.

For most patients, we prefer cladribine because of the shorter duration of therapy required (five to seven days versus several months), and general tolerability. Pentostatin has a boxed warning for severe renal toxicities with doses higher than recommended; do not exceed the recommended dose. Serum creatinine elevations occurring at recommended doses are usually minor and reversible.</p><p>The majority of patients achieve durable remissions with either multiple cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> or a single cycle of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In one study of 233 patients followed for a median period of 16 years, cladribine and pentostatin resulted in similar overall response rates (100 versus 96 percent), rates of CR (76 versus 82 percent), and 10-year survivals (100 versus 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hairy-cell-leukemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].
