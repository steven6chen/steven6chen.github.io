Postcardiac injury syndrome was first described after myocardial infarction by Dressler in 1956 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The principal conditions considered under this rubric are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmyocardial infarction syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpericardiotomy syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic pericarditis</p><p/><p>The term &quot;postpericardiotomy syndrome&quot; was substituted for the previous &quot;postcardiotomy syndrome&quot; after it was discovered that the syndrome can occur after the pericardium is opened even if no other cardiac structures are involved (eg, after surgery for bronchogenic lung carcinoma). Furthermore, the provoking cardiac injury may be surprisingly minor (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention, insertion of a pacing lead, radiofrequency ablation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of post-cardiac injury syndromes will be reviewed here. The clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111358\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While generally considered to occur infrequently, the incidence of post-cardiac injury syndromes is not entirely clear. Studies performed in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients in the era prior to reperfusion reported different rates of post-cardiac injury syndrome, with one study estimating the incidence at 3 percent of patients post-MI, while another report from the same era found almost no cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Subsequently, the post-cardiac injury syndrome following MI appears to have largely disappeared in the reperfusion era, perhaps due to a decrease in size of most MIs. In one cohort of 201 consecutive patients with acute MI treated with fibrinolysis, only one patient developed post-cardiac injury syndrome, and this patient had no evidence of reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The risk factors may be different for early (within seven days) versus late effusions and suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome. This was illustrated in a registry of patients with significant pericardial effusions after cardiothoracic surgery who underwent pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Anticoagulant therapy was a considered to be a contributing factor in the majority of early effusions (&lt;7 days), while postpericardiotomy syndrome was an important contributing factor in approximately one-third of effusions occurring after seven days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25607534\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pericardium is a fibroelastic sac made up of visceral and parietal layers separated by a (potential) space, the pericardial cavity. In healthy individuals, the pericardial cavity contains 15 to 50 mL of an ultrafiltrate of plasma.</p><p>Acute pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardial sac. The term &quot;myopericarditis,&quot; or &quot;perimyocarditis,&quot; is used for cases of acute pericarditis that also demonstrate myocardial inflammation. </p><p>The post-cardiac injury syndrome, including posttraumatic pericarditis, appears to be initiated by the combination of damage to mesothelial pericardial cells and blood in the pericardial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The initial injury is thought to release cardiac antigens and stimulate an immune response. The immune complexes that are generated are then deposited in the pericardium, pleura, and lungs, eliciting an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following observations are compatible with this hypothesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discrete latent period from cardiac injury to the clinical onset of post-cardiac injury syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexistent pleural effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary infiltrates in some cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have found a statistically significant correlation between the postoperative to preoperative ratios of antiactin and antimyosin antibodies and the clinical occurrence of post-cardiac injury syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The generally excellent response to anti-inflammatory therapy, and occasional relapses after steroid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The initial prospective study that identified immune complexes in the post-cardiac injury syndrome compared children who did and did not develop a postpericardiotomy syndrome after cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Those who developed postpericardiotomy syndrome had increased antimyocardial antibodies resulting from myocardial injury. Several subsequent studies have demonstrated the presence of antimyocardial antibodies in patients who develop the postpericardiotomy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/9,10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12,13</a>]. Antimyocardial antibodies have also been discovered in the pleural fluid of one such patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the significance of these antibodies and their relation to the severity of myocardial injury is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Support for antiheart antibodies being an epiphenomenon comes from a prospective study of 20 surgical patients in whom serum was sampled for antiheart antibodies before and periodically after elective coronary artery bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Antiheart antibodies were absent in all patients on the day before surgery. Three patients developed postpericardiotomy syndrome. All were seronegative at the time of diagnosis, but they became seropositive within the ensuing 14 days.</p><p>The post-cardiac injury syndrome has also been described in children following orthotopic cardiac transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because these children are immunosuppressed, it has been suggested this syndrome is not always an autoimmune process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25607602\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop post-cardiac injury syndrome present with signs and symptoms similar to those seen in patients with acute pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial effusion in other clinical settings.

In a cohort of 360 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 54 patients (15 percent) developed post-cardiac injury syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most frequent signs and symptoms in patients who developed post-cardiac injury syndrome in this cohort were pleuritic chest pain (56 percent) and fever (54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Common findings on physical examination and diagnostic testing included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion (89 percent), although cardiac tamponade was rare (2 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (74 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial rub (32 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiographic changes (24 percent)</p><p/><p>Physical examination may sometimes disclose a pericardial friction rub (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56608\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608 \">movie 1</a>). A mediastinal friction rub or &quot;crunch&quot; (a substernal, crunching, rasping sound that is synchronous with the heartbeat and usually associated with palpable chest wall surgical emphysema) is frequently appreciated in the first few days after cardiac surgery and is caused by surgical emphysema; it should be distinguished from a true pericardial friction rub. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds#H49\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;, section on 'Pericardial friction rub and other adventitious sounds'</a>.)</p><p>Chylopericardium is a rare manifestation of post-cardiac injury syndrome. It tends to occur in children who have had extensive surgical treatment for complex congenital malformations. However, any operation involving dissection of the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery risks injury to the right efferent lymphatic trunk and subsequent chylopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chylopericardium-and-cholesterol-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chylopericardium and cholesterol pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111617\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of all patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome includes laboratory testing, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest radiograph, and an echocardiogram.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111978\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome should have laboratory testing including complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and troponin. Most but not all patients will have an elevated white blood cell count and inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR). There is little consensus on the need for serial or follow-up studies, but most experts recheck inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) following the resolution of symptoms (typically within one to two weeks) to ensure that the inflammation is resolving prior to tapering or discontinuing therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111741\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 12-lead ECG should be performed in all patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome, although it is difficult to make the diagnosis based on ECG findings alone. The ECG is most often abnormal following a myocardial infarction or other forms of cardiac surgery, for a variety of reasons (eg, ischemic ST segment or T wave changes, developing Q waves, post-operative epicardial pacing, etc). However, when ECG changes suggestive of pericarditis are present (ie, diffuse ST-segment elevation in association with PR depression) and represent a change from the patient's baseline ECG, this is highly suggestive of post-cardiac injury syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H2297355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111748\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to the ECG, a chest radiograph should be performed in all patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome, although it is not possible to definitively make the diagnosis based on radiographic findings alone. The chest radiograph in a patient who has developed a postoperative pericardial effusion often reveals an increase in heart size (particularly when compared with a baseline radiograph). When this is seen, the presence of an effusion should be promptly confirmed or excluded by echocardiography. In a significant minority of patients, the chest radiograph also reveals a pleural effusion, usually unilateral, although this may become apparent only on a subsequent film. Pulmonary infiltrates are occasionally seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleural-effusions-following-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pleural effusions following cardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111998\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected post-cardiac injury syndrome should be evaluated with echocardiography. In most instances, transthoracic echocardiography is satisfactory, but transesophageal echocardiography may be required in patients with difficult or limited imaging windows (as can frequently occur postoperatively) in whom the transthoracic study is non-diagnostic. The echocardiogram should assess for the presence or absence of pericardial effusion, document the size of the effusion, and provide echocardiographically-derived hemodynamic data, which may support or refute the presence of cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Serial echocardiographic studies have shown that postoperative pericardial effusion following cardiac surgery is considerably more common than is clinically obvious, occurring in as many as 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The effusion is usually present by the second postoperative day but may not occur until day 10. In most cases, the effusion reaches its maximal size by about the tenth postoperative day followed by gradual resolution. Because postoperative pericardial effusions are so common and most are benign, there is no rationale for routine postoperative echocardiography in the absence of other clinical features that suggest pericardial disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111628\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of post-cardiac injury syndrome is typically suspected based upon the characteristic clinical picture of pleuritic chest pain and fever in a patient with a myocardial infarction or pericardial <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/invasion</span> within the appropriate time frame (as early as one week to as late as three months prior to symptoms). Abnormalities seen on laboratory testing (leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated CRP), electrocardiogram (diffuse ST-segment elevation in association with PR depression, although often absent and masked by other ECG findings), chest radiograph (increased heart size, pleural effusion), and echocardiogram (pericardial effusion) are supportive, but none is specific enough to definitively make the diagnosis. The combination of a pericardial friction rub and ECG findings typical of pericarditis strongly supports the diagnosis, and the diagnosis is also strongly supported if an echocardiogram reveals a pericardial effusion at a time when effusions are no longer routine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63111447\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-cardiac injury syndrome should be distinguished from other clinical conditions that result in fever and pleuritic chest pain. In most instances, post-cardiac injury syndrome can be distinguished from other entities by the clinical scenario; however, in some instances, post-cardiac injury syndrome can coexist with other pathology (eg, rib fractures or pneumothorax following chest trauma, etc). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleuritis or pleuropericarditis (including infectious and noninfectious causes such as pneumonia and malignancy) &ndash; Infectious causes are typically associated with sputum production, while noninfectious causes such as malignancy have other associated systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, signs of the primary malignancy, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outpatient-evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism &ndash; Patients will often have an associated risk for thromboembolism (eg, surgery, immobility, malignancy) and are typically hypoxic. Pulmonary embolism is typically diagnosed when filling defects are seen on computed tomography pulmonary angiography. The considerable overlap in clinical presentation between post-cardiac injury syndrome and pulmonary embolism with associated pulmonary infarction often requires computed tomography (CT) angiography to distinguish between the two entities.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) &ndash; Typically this occurs following vomiting, prolonged coughing, childbirth, or weightlifting with straining. Free air within the mediastinum or peritoneum on a chest radiograph is suggestive of esophageal rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=boerhaave-syndrome-effort-rupture-of-the-esophagus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Boerhaave syndrome: Effort rupture of the esophagus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothorax &ndash; Primary pneumothorax typically occurs in younger patients (less than 40 years of age), while secondary pneumothorax is typically iatrogenic (eg, following central venous catheter placement or bronchoscopy) or traumatic (eg, rib fractures). In most instances this should be visible on the chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connective tissue disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) &ndash; Typically patients have other signs of systemic involvement by the connective tissue disorder (eg, musculoskeletal symptoms, rash, kidney disease, etc). Laboratory testing for connective tissue disorders may be required to differentiate this from other causes of pleuritis or pleuropericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial involvement in systemic autoimmune diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>When the post-cardiac injury syndrome occurs after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), it is also known as Dressler's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This disorder must be distinguished from the pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effusion which may occur early after a transmural MI as a result of involvement of the epicardial surface or rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-cardiac-injury-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The former is almost always benign, while the latter usually results in rapid and severe hemodynamic compromise. Early pericardial complications typically occur two to four days after MI, while post-MI cardiac injury syndrome occurs one week to as long as two to three months after MI.

We suggest the administration of colchicine prophylactically following cardiac surgery in an effort to prevent the development of postpericardiotomy syndrome.
