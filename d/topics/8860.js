Conversely, neutropenia can lead to infection, typically from bacterial organisms. A number of different mechanisms are involved, including infection of hematopoietic precursor cells, infection of endothelial cells, increased neutrophil adherence to endothelium, development of antineutrophil antibodies, and enhanced neutrophil utilization at the site of infection associated with hypersplenism. Drugs given to treat these infections may also cause neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-neutropenia-and-agranulocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review will discuss the neutropenias that can occur during bacterial, viral, parasitic, or rickettsial infections. Approaches to determining the cause of unexplained neutropenia in children and adults are presented separately.

The ANC is equal to the product of the white blood cell count (WBC) and the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and band forms noted on the differential analysis:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160;ANC &#160;= &#160;WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">(cells/microL)</span> &#160;x &#160;percent (PMNs &#160;+ &#160;bands) &#160;&divide; &#160;100</p></div></div><p>Neutrophilic metamyelocytes and younger forms are not included in this calculation. The risk of infection begins to increase at an ANC below <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Leukopenia and granulocytopenia are generally used interchangeably with neutropenia, although they are somewhat different. Leukopenia refers to a low WBC that may be due to lymphopenia as well as neutropenia, while granulocytopenia refers to a reduced number of granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Agranulocytosis literally means the absence of granulocytes, but the term is often used to indicate severe neutropenia (ie, ANC less than <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL)</span>.</p><p>Most cases of neutropenia are acquired and are due to decreased granulocyte production or increased destruction. Acquired neutropenia is most often due to accelerated turnover, usually resulting from immunologic mechanisms. The key questions that arise in the patient with infection and neutropenia are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient infected because of the neutropenia?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient neutropenic because of the infection?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the two events totally unrelated?</p><p/><p>The critical clinical question is whether or not the patient is at increased risk of overwhelming infection because of the neutropenia, as this will determine the immediate management of the infection. The propensity to infection from neutropenia is related to the adequacy of the bone marrow reserve pool and other factors such as presence of vasculitis or immune deficiency. Certain patients with normal marrow reserve and an ANC of zero may be at no increased risk because of the neutropenia. These distinctions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259511380\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROME SECONDARY TO INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are two terms that in our opinion describe different intensities of the same process. There is much misunderstanding as this nomenclature suggests these are two separate disorders. Macrophages become activated in response to many stimuli and the degree certainly can be sufficient to cause splenomegaly and some cytopenia. With infection like Epstein-Barr virus, this reaction can be quite pronounced. However, it is self-limited. Some splenomegaly and mild cytopenia is so common in childhood infectious diseases and is often ignored. In some cases, this process is not self-limited and can progress to a very severe, potentially life-threatening syndrome of excess immune activation. This latter non-self-limited syndrome is what we consider to be HLH. This can be triggered by numerous viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections, with Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, and herpes simplex virus often being associated with severe forms, especially in the face of genetic mutations involving immune regulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H549028\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Infections'</a>.)</p><p>This association between infection and <span class=\"nowrap\">MAS/HLH</span> must be kept in mind when reviewing reports of neutropenia associated with infection. Several infections that have been associated with neutropenia are noted below. However, these clinical descriptions originated before the current understanding of MAS and HLH was developed. Thus these should not be considered as clearly separate clinical entities. Many of these, with some exceptions, are cytopenic reactions to infectious stimuli that are probably variations on a theme of infection induced MAS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIAL INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukocytosis with an increased number of band forms (ie, a shift to the left) is the usual response to bacterial infection.

The number of circulating band forms was increased, the PMN half-life was prolonged, and the total blood granulocyte pool was normal or increased. The marginating PMN pool was greatly enlarged while the circulating PMN pool was reduced, indicating that the apparent neutropenia was due to a shift of circulating PMN into the marginating pool primarily in the spleen and lung. These patients had decreased numbers and reserves of bone marrow PMNs, presumably due to their premature release into the circulation.
