Some are present from birth or develop as part of inherited syndromes, but the vast majority are acquired later in life. The reasons for the distortion of vascular structures observed with advancing age are poorly understood.</p><p>Inconsistent taxonomy of vascular anomalies in the GI tract, along with a common presentation of GI bleeding from different vascular abnormalities, has led to significant confusion in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The diagnosis of a vascular anomaly can be based upon endoscopic findings, histologic characteristics, or association with systemic diseases.</p><p>Vascular anomalies can be divided into three broad categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular tumors or angiomas, which can be benign (such as hemangiomas) or malignant (such as Kaposi sarcoma or angiosarcoma).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular anomalies associated with congenital or systemic diseases such as blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, Klippel-Tr&eacute;naunay-Weber syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the CREST variant of scleroderma, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired and sporadic lesions such as angiodysplasias, gastric antral vascular ectasias, radiation-induced vascular ectasias, and Dieulafoy's lesions.</p><p/><p>Angiodysplasias are the most common vascular anomalies encountered in the GI tract. The pathology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of angiodysplasia will be reviewed here. The evaluation of occult and suspected small bowel bleeding, as well as Dieulafoy lesions and gastric antral vascular ectasias, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-occult-gastrointestinal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-small-bowel-bleeding-formerly-obscure-gastrointestinal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms angiodysplasia, arteriovenous malformation, angiectasia, and vascular ectasia have been used synonymously. Angiodysplasias are usually distinguished from telangiectasias, which, while anatomically similar, are usually referred to in the context of systemic or congenital diseases. In addition, some authors use angiectasia as a generic term, reserving the term angiodysplasia for colonic lesions.</p><p>Since most vascular abnormalities are detected during endoscopy, a taxonomy based upon endoscopic appearance has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The classification system recognizes the location, size, and number of angiodysplasias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67055 \">table 1</a>). With the advent of newer endoscopic techniques, there has been an attempt to classify the lesions found in the small bowel according to size, overt bleeding, and surrounding vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these classifications are not widely used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wireless-video-capsule-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wireless video capsule endoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal (GI) angiodysplasia is most often detected in patients older than 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>], although presentation in patients in their 30s has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence of GI angiodysplasia in the overall population is not well known. In a report that pooled three prospective studies of colonoscopic screening for neoplasia in healthy asymptomatic adults (older than 50 years, mean age 62 years), angiodysplasia was detected in only 8 of 964 patients (0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence may be higher with more sensitive techniques such as injection studies in resected colon specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The prevalence is increased in patients with end-stage renal disease, von Willebrand disease, and possibly aortic stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Conditions associated with angiodysplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients have more than one angiodysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. While they are usually in the same portion of the GI tract, synchronous lesions elsewhere in the GI tract are found in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In one series of patients thought to be bleeding from angiodysplasia of the colon, small bowel angiodysplasia was detected in 23 percent, either at the original laparotomy or during investigation for recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This illustrates the point that a given angiodysplasia can only be confidently considered the source of GI blood loss if it is seen to be actively bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditions associated with angiodysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of angiodysplasia is increased in older populations, in patients with GI bleeding, and in patients with certain predisposing conditions such as end-stage renal disease, von Willebrand disease, and possibly aortic stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">End-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiodysplasia account for approximately 20 and 30 percent of episodes of upper and lower GI bleeding, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and for approximately one-half of recurrent episodes of upper GI bleeding in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. They can occur anywhere along the GI tract and are usually multiple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

One possible explanation is that the lesions are not more common, but are instead detected more frequently because of the increased risk of bleeding associated with uremia-induced platelet dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-dysfunction-in-uremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet dysfunction in uremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">von Willebrand disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between angiodysplasia and congenital or acquired von Willebrand disease has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, similar to end-stage renal disease, this association may reflect an increased tendency for angiodysplasia to become clinically evident because of an underlying coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding from angiodysplasia in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) has been called Heyde's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While it has been repeatedly reported, some aspects remain controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>In support of the relationship of angiodysplasia with AS is the observation that clinically significant bleeding improves in most patients after aortic valve replacement (AVR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. One report, for example, evaluated 91 patients with AS and suspected chronic small bowel bleeding, presumably from angiodysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Sixteen of these patients underwent AVR for AS during follow-up of 8 to 12 years, with cessation of chronic GI blood loss in all but one.

The results of small case-control and retrospective studies have been equivocal:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report compared echocardiographic findings in 40 patients with angiodysplasia with 37 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. None of the patients in either group had evidence of aortic stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar observation was made in a retrospective series of 59 patients with angiodysplasia, only one of whom had echocardiographic evidence of aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, a third report of 73 patients with angiodysplasia who had undergone echocardiography did suggest an association with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In that report, the prevalence of AS was 32 percent, which was significantly higher than the prevalence among the general population of patients who undergo echocardiography (approximately 14 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157067859\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular assist devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GI bleeding is common among patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and is often related to angiodysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. The pathophysiology is thought to be related to acquired von Willebrand disease.

Among those with GI bleeding, angiodysplasia accounted for 31 percent of the bleeding episodes. Similarly, in a series of 391 patients with LVADs, 62 patients (16 percent) developed GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Studies in which casts of angiodysplasias were made by injecting a silicone material demonstrated that the most prominent feature in angiodysplasias is the presence of dilated, tortuous submucosal veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Small arteriovenous communications are also present and are due to incompetence of the precapillary sphincter. Enlarged arteries may be seen in larger angiodysplasias and may be associated with arteriovenous fistulas, which explains why bleeding can be brisk in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52754\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52754 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Histologic confirmation is often difficult. When obtained, it shows dilated vessels in the mucosa and submucosa, sometimes covered by only a single layer of surface epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74301\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74301 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of angiodysplasia is not well understood. However, a proposed theory is that angiodysplasia develop due to intermittent, recurrent low-grade obstruction of submucosal veins at the level of the muscularis propria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76997 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Over years, the obstruction results in dilatation and tortuosity of the draining areas (ie, submucosal vessels, venules, and superficial capillaries).</p><p>The venous obstruction hypothesis is consistent with the observation that angiodysplasia often occurs in the right colon where wall tension is highest. This increased wall tension selectively compresses thin-walled veins, while allowing normal flow through the thicker-walled higher-pressure arterioles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiogenic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased expression of angiogenic factors has been found in human colonic angiodysplasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

This raises the possibility that the increased prevalence of angiodysplasia in patients with AS is due to increased detection because these patients are more likely to present with bleeding.

The risk of subsequent bleeding in patients who are found to have nonbleeding colonic angiodysplasia is not well established. The number of lesions and the presence of coexisting coagulopathies or platelet dysfunction may be important determinants. Patients who have bled from colonic angiodysplasia are at increased risk for subsequent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The aggressiveness of the diagnostic approach should be individualized depending upon the clinical circumstances. As an example, further evaluation is probably not necessary in a patient with a negative upper and lower endoscopy and negative wireless capsule endoscopy, unless the patient is bleeding severely enough to require transfusions.

Because angiodysplasia can be located throughout the GI tract, a combination of endoscopic techniques may be necessary.</p><p>Angiodysplasias characteristically appear as small (5 to 10 mm), flat, cherry-red lesions with a fern-like pattern of arborizing, ectatic blood vessels radiating from a central vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50137%7EGAST%2F73541\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50137 graphicRef73541 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The characteristic appearance may be more evident in the colon. Small intestinal lesions are often smaller than those seen in other parts of the GI tract. The fern-like pattern should be specifically looked for since other erythematous mucosal lesions or normal blood vessels can be mistaken for angiodysplasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity of colonoscopy for the detection of angiodysplasia is unknown since angiography would be required as a gold standard. However, it is estimated to exceed 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Angiodysplasia may be difficult to visualize during colonoscopy in patients who do not have an optimal bowel preparation or when lesions are situated behind a haustral fold. In addition, transiently decreased mucosal blood flow due to the administration of opioid sedation or air insufflation may make angiodysplasia less visible. It is therefore possible that administration of an opioid antagonist or the withdrawal of air during the examination may improve their detection.</p><p>Administration of an opioid antagonist was evaluated in a series of 144 patients older than 60 years of age who underwent colonoscopy for occult or overt bleeding or iron deficiency anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
