Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an alternative to an intermittent therapy such as standard hemodialysis.</p><p>CRRT may require anticoagulation to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuits, although CRRT without anticoagulation is often attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews strategies to prevent clotting and approaches to anticoagulation for patients on CRRT. Other issues related to CRRT are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-removal-in-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug removal in continuous renal replacement therapy&quot;</a>).

Replacing the hemofilter and tubing interrupts CRRT and reduces the total therapy time. Studies have shown that interruptions from clotting may reduce the total time on CRRT from 24 to 16 hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Such reductions reduce the effectiveness of CRRT. A sufficient operating time is required to ensure that an adequate RRT dose is delivered.</p><p>However, anticoagulation increases the complexity and cost of the procedure.</p><p>At our center, we perform CRRT without anticoagulation, providing filter life can be maintained for &gt;24 hours. We use anticoagulation if the filter life cannot be maintained for &gt;24 hours. However, some centers routinely use anticoagulation from the start in order to prevent clotting, and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest the use of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2680917799\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE ANTICOAGULANT THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used options for CRRT anticoagulation include regional citrate (RCA) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), thrombin antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>), UFH with protamine reversal, heparinoids, and platelet-inhibiting agents are less common options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1685403808\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional citrate anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RCA decreases the rate of clotting and may be used in all CRRT modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2471169903\" class=\"local\">'Regional citrate anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>During RCA, sodium citrate is infused into the inflow (&quot;arterial&quot;) limb of the extracorporeal circuit, chelating calcium and inhibiting clotting. The majority of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> complex is removed across the hemofilter. Any calcium citrate complex that remains postfilter is returned to the patient and metabolized to bicarbonate by the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Regional anticoagulation is reversed by dilution of citrate in the extracellular compartment and by its rapid metabolic clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A systemic calcium infusion is required to replace the calcium that is lost in the effluent in order to maintain a normal ionized serum calcium concentration.</p><p>The use of RCA may require modification of the composition of dialysate or replacement fluid. The concentration of buffers (eg, bicarbonate, lactate) is usually reduced to prevent alkalosis since citrate provides alkali.</p><p>Ideally, the dialysate and replacement fluids should also be calcium free to prevent reversal of the citrate effect in the extracorporeal circuit, although this is not absolutely necessary. If calcium-containing replacement fluid is used, more citrate is required to chelate calcium in both the blood and replacement fluid.</p><p>RCA use for CRRT is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The absence of a US FDA-approved citrate regimen has been a barrier to use of citrate regimens in the United States.

In all, citrate solution is infused into the blood at the beginning of the extracorporeal circuit.

In a study of 133 patients treated with RCA, severe alkalosis (pH &gt;7.55) was present in approximately 2 percent of patients and severe hypocalcemia (ionized calcium &le;0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in approximately 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Hypercalcemia (ionized calcium &ge;1.5) did not occur in this study.</p><p>Alkalosis is less common when replacement solutions and dialysate solutions contain reduced bicarbonate concentrations. Solutions commonly used for patients who are not on RCA contain bicarbonate solution of 32 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> whereas solutions for patients treated with RCA contain bicarbonate concentration of 22 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

Clotting decreases the total therapy time and efficacy. A sufficient time on CRRT is necessary to ensure an adequate RRT dose is delivered. (See <a href=\"#H1737971268\" class=\"local\">'Indications and rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we attempt CRRT without anticoagulation, although many clinicians use anticoagulation from the outset. We usually can achieve adequate CRRT filter survival if the patient has a well-functioning vascular access. Strategies to prolong hemofilter survival in the absence of anticoagulation are discussed. (See <a href=\"#H3452340191\" class=\"local\">'Initial approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the hemofilter cannot be maintained without anticoagulation for at least 24 hours, we use anticoagulation. If regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is available and the patient has no contraindications, we use RCA rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH). RCA is better than heparin at preserving filter patency and is less likely to cause adverse events, including bleeding. However, RCA has not been shown to provide a survival benefit compared with heparin. (See <a href=\"#H3447021295\" class=\"local\">'Patients with repeated clotting of hemofilter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to RCA include acute liver failure with transaminases &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> and cardiogenic shock with lactate values &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1103146952\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients on RCA should be closely monitored for evidence of citrate accumulation and other complications of CRRT. Our monitoring strategy is defined. (See <a href=\"#H3680671950\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RCA should be stopped if there is citrate accumulation. Citrate accumulation is suggested by worsening metabolic acidosis, decreasing ionized calcium, and increasing total calcium. We stop RCA if serum bicarbonate levels continue to fall over several measurements with increasing anion gap, if the ratio of total calcium to ionized calcium exceeds 2.5, and if the calcium infusion rates exceeds 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. (See <a href=\"#H186193530\" class=\"local\">'Citrate accumulation and indications to stop RCA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient requires anticoagulation and we cannot use RCA, we use UFH.
