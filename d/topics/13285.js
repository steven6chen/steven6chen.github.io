The exact stage of POP is diagnosed on pelvic exam. A medical history is also important to elicit associated symptoms, since treatment of urinary or fecal symptoms is typically coordinated with treatment for POP. Asymptomatic POP may not require treatment. </p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of women with POP is reviewed here.</p><p>An overview of the female pelvic exam, POP, and treatment options are discussed separately and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120849\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the severity of prolapse was graded using a variety of imprecise classification systems that were not easily reproduced or communicated in a standard way among clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation system (POPQ), introduced in 1996, has become the standard classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1121013\"><span class=\"h2\">POPQ system</span></p><p>The POPQ system is an objective, site-specific system for describing and staging POP in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The POPQ system involves quantitative measurements of various points representing anterior, apical, and posterior vaginal prolapse to create a &quot;topographic&quot; map of the vagina. These anatomic points can then be used to determine the stage of the prolapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74368 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57450 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72477 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The POPQ system is the POP classification system of choice of the International Continence Society (ICS), the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS), and the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons (SGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has also recommended its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It has proven interobserver and intraobserver reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and is the system used most commonly in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Intraoperative POPQ measurements correlate well with preoperative findings, with slightly more prolapse under anesthesia when traction is placed on the POPQ points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The S-POPQ may be an easier classification system to use in routine clinical practice. It was developed by the International Urogynecology Association to provide a less cumbersome exam tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The S-POPQ stages prolapse for the anterior and posterior vaginal walls, the <span class=\"nowrap\">apex/cuff</span> of the vagina and the cervix. For women posthysterectomy, there are three stages; for women with an intact uterus there are four. The exam is carried out similarly to the standard POPQ exam, with a half speculum placed in the vagina to visualize the vaginal walls and cervix. (See <a href=\"#H9800329\" class=\"local\">'Simplified POPQ'</a> below.)</p><p>In this topic, classification of POP will be described using the original POPQ.

The degree, or grade, of each prolapsed structure is described individually (eg, grade 1 anterior vaginal wall prolapse or grade 3 uterine prolapse). The <span class=\"nowrap\">grade/degree</span> is defined as the extent of prolapse for each structure noted on examination while the patient is straining. Because there are no clear demarcations among the cut-off stages, the Baden-Walker system lacks the precision and reproducibility of the POPQ system.</p><p>The system has five <span class=\"nowrap\">degrees/grades</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the urethra, posterior descent is graded, for other anatomic sites, the lowest part is graded: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 &ndash; Normal position for each respective site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 &ndash; Descent halfway to the hymen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 &ndash; Descent to the hymen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 &ndash; Descent halfway past the hymen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 &ndash; Maximum possible descent for each site</p><p/><p>Modifications of this system also exist. </p><p>The Baden-Walker system lacks the precision and reproducibility of the POPQ system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7156552\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history includes symptoms specific to prolapse, as well as urinary, defecatory, and sexual problems, which are often associated with POP. A detailed discussion of symptoms associated with POP can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H21524755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.). </p><p>There are no robust screening questionnaires for mild pelvic organ prolapse. Some epidemiologic studies have used a single question to screen for prolapse from a validated pelvic floor distress questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], which likely captures only those patients with severe prolapse. By asking the question &ldquo;Do you experience bulging or something falling out you can see or feel in the vaginal area?&rdquo;, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported a 3 percent prevalence rate of advanced prolapse in the study population of nearly 2500 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Women with a positive response to this question should undergo a pelvic examination.</p><p>Symptom assessment is important, since treatment is generally not indicated for asymptomatic POP. In addition, assessment of POP symptoms and their impact on a patient&rsquo;s quality of life helps patients and clinicians set treatment goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Treatment of urinary or defecatory conditions is typically coordinated with POP treatment.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H21524755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the medical history should include a review of medical comorbidities that could impact whether the patient is a candidate for surgical treatment.

The extent of prolapse visualized on examination should confirm the patient&rsquo;s description of bulging symptoms. If the severity of prolapse visualized does not correlate with the patient&rsquo;s description, a hand-held mirror may be beneficial to confirm that what the provider is seeing is the full extent of the prolapse.</p><p>The patient is examined initially in the dorsal lithotomy position. A prospective series of 218 women reported that performing the pelvic examination in the left lateral position (a common position used to assess pelvic support in the United Kingdom) yielded results that correlated highly with findings in the lithotomy position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The examination is then repeated with the patient standing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. This is the position that will best approximate the extent of prolapse that the patient experiences daily. In the standing position, the patient places one foot on a well-supported footstool. The examining gown is lifted slightly to expose the genital area during the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20651678\"><span class=\"h2\">Documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A full description of the examination is recorded, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of examination table, speculum, and retractors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder and rectal fullness. </p><p/><p>It is important to note and document any episodes of urinary, fecal, or flatal incontinence that occur during the examination. </p><p>The findings of the examination should be recorded using a quantitative and reproducible method for recording POP.

Taken together, these measurements can be used to produce a sagittal diagram of the prolapse. </p><p>During the examination, the maximum extent of prolapse is determined for each of the six points.

A minus sign is used to designate a point that is proximal, or superior, to the hymenal plane (eg, -3 cm), while points distal or inferior to the hymenal plane are preceded by a positive sign (eg, +2 cm). </p><p>The measurements can be marked on line diagrams (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62226 \">figure 3</a>), noted on a grid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57450 \">figure 2</a>), or recorded in text form.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20651194\"><span class=\"h3\">POPQ measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each point is located by measuring along the vaginal wall or identifying the most dependent point of a prolapsed structure.

Like the standard POPQ examination, the Simple POPQ (S-POPQ) measures the anterior, posterior and up to two measurements of the apex, including both the cervix, in women who still have one, and posterior cul-de-sac. The S-POPQ records the ordinal stage of the four measurements by estimating the distances involved. For measurement of the anterior wall, a point approximately 3 cm or halfway up the anterior vaginal wall is visualized, the woman is asked to strain, and the amount of descent is recorded. A similar process is carried out to estimate the descent of the posterior wall. Finally, a Sims speculum is utilized to record the descent of the apex of the vagina. The following definitions are used to Stage the prolapse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1: Prolapse where the given point remains at least 1 cm above the hymenal remnants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2: Prolapse where the given point descends to the introitus, defined as an area extending from 1 cm above to 1 cm below the hymenal remnants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3: Prolapse where the given point descends greater than 1 cm past the hymenal remnants, but does not represent complete vaginal vault eversion or complete uterine procidentia. This implies that at least some portion of the vaginal mucosa is not everted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4: Complete vaginal vault eversion or complete uterine procidentia. This implies that the vagina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uterus are maximally prolapsed with essentially the entire extent of the vaginal mucosa everted.</p><p/><p>The S-POPQ has been validated against the original staging system of the POPQ and has been found to be highly correlated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9800345\"><span class=\"h4\">SLmax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLmax, also known as maximum vaginal descent, was introduced as a continuous value of vaginal support that describes prolapse as a single summary score. This measure is calculated as a single score for comparison of prolapse between populations and is not meant to replace the more detailed POPQ. SLmax simply represents the most distal presenting part of the vagina, in centimeters. The minimum value is -3 by definition, and the measure was shown to correlate well with POPQ measurements and results of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional examination techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Simulated apical support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeating the speculum examination with simulated apical support (ie, supporting the vaginal apex with a large cotton swab or ring forceps) approximates the results following apical prolapse repair.

If sensory function is abnormal, more detailed neurologic testing may be warranted.</p><p>Sacral reflexes should also be assessed. To evaluate for sacral nerve integrity, the bulbocavernosus reflex is elicited by gently tapping or squeezing the clitoris. The anocutaneous reflex (anal wink sign) is triggered by stroking the skin immediately surrounding the anus and observing a reflexive contraction of the external anal sphincter; this reflex should be elicited bilaterally. Absence of these reflexes is not always abnormal and hyperreflexia or asymmetry may in fact be more suggestive of a neurologic etiology. As with sensory function, abnormal findings of reflex testing warrant a more detailed neurologic examination and possible referral to a specialist.</p><p>Detailed neurologic evaluation begins with a thorough medical history, including a personal or family history of neurologic disease or related conditions.

The examiner should also note the presence of scarring and whether pelvic floor contraction pulls the perineum inward. Palpation through the vagina or rectum helps in assessing pelvic floor squeeze strength and levator muscle thickness. The tone and strength of the pelvic floor muscles can be assessed by asking the patient to contract the pelvic floor muscles around the examining fingers. Women with poor pelvic floor muscle function may benefit from pelvic physical therapy. </p><p>Guidelines have been published by the International Continence Society to assess pelvic floor musculature tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Four conditions have been defined: normal pelvic floor muscles are those which can voluntarily contract and relax, overactive pelvic floor muscles are muscles which do not relax, underactive pelvic floor muscles are those which cannot voluntarily contract, and non-functioning pelvic floor muscles is when there is no pelvic floor muscle action palpable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Electromyography with needle electrodes permits visualization of individual motor unit action potentials; surface electrodes detect activity of groups of motor units. Pressure recording from the urethra, vagina, and anus can be used to assess pelvic floor muscle strength.

While women with POP often have SUI symptoms, many women with stage II or higher apical prolapse remain continent despite loss of anterior vaginal and <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/urethral</span> support. However, 13 to 65 percent of continent women develop symptoms of SUI after surgical correction of the prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. This likely occurs because the prolapse kinks and obstructs the urethra; this obstruction is alleviated when the prolapse is repaired. This is referred to as &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;potential&quot; stress incontinence. </p><p>All continent women with apical prolapse should have a preoperative evaluation for occult SUI with clinical or urodynamic urinary stress testing with and without reduction of prolapse. However, preoperative prolapse reduction testing does not accurately predict postoperative stress incontinence (approximately 40 percent of women with negative testing will develop postoperative stress incontinence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].The routine use of urodynamics in women with prolapse, with or without symptomatic SUI, is controversial. Urodynamic testing is time-consuming and incurs expense, and it is unclear whether it improves surgical decision-making in women with uncomplicated SUI. We suggest urodynamics be performed only in women with complicated SUI (eg, previous anti-incontinence surgery, neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, or suspicion of a non-stress etiology of urinary incontinence) or when symptoms are not consistent with physical examination findings.
