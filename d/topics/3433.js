It involves the back of the eye. In chorioretinitis, structures in the back of the eye called the &quot;choroid&quot; and &quot;retina&quot; get inflamed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70420 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Chorioretinitis can be caused by different things. Often, it's caused by an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7004211\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chorioretinitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorioretinitis is usually painless. Common symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seeing dark spots (called &quot;floaters&quot;) in your vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor vision at night</p><p/><p>Not everyone with these symptoms has chorioretinitis. Different eye conditions can also cause these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7004243\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and other medical problems. You will also have a detailed eye exam. This will probably be done by an eye specialist. During the exam, he or she will use a magnifying tool to look in the back of your eye.</p><p>Your doctor might also do tests to check for an infection that could be causing your chorioretinitis. These tests can include blood tests or a chest X-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7004258\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chorioretinitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorioretinitis is usually treated by an eye specialist.</p><p>Treatment depends, in part, on what's causing your chorioretinitis. If an infection or other medical condition is causing your chorioretinitis, your doctor will treat that infection or condition.</p><p>Other treatment depends on how mild or severe the inflammation is. If the inflammation is mild, your doctor might not treat it. But he or she will monitor your condition to make sure it doesn't get worse.</p><p>If the inflammation is more serious, your doctor will treat it. Treatment might involve getting a shot of a medicine called a steroid into your eye or around your eye. Steroids help with inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p>If the steroid shot doesn't help enough, your doctor might prescribe steroid pills or other medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7004273\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uveitis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
