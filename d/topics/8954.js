Low-risk disease is characterized by any one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FIGO stage I GTN &ndash; This is characterized as a persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor confined to the uterus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II or III GTN with a WHO risk score &lt;7</p><p/><p>Further discussion of high-risk GTN is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia#H19647747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Definition of high-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582341\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with low-risk GTN are cured with single-agent chemotherapy, using either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or actinomycin D (ActD). Because of the overall excellent prognosis, immediate treatment with multiagent regimens is generally not necessary, and in our experience, single-agent chemotherapy is most often utilized with success. However, some reports suggest that patients with prognostic scores of 5 or 6 may be at an increased risk of resistance to single-agent chemotherapy, with up to 70 percent of these patients requiring combination chemotherapy to achieve remission. Studies are ongoing to try to better define which &quot;low-risk&quot; patients may particularly benefit from primary combination chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Patients with low-risk GTN have an overall excellent prognosis with survival rates of 100 percent after treatment, although this may require additional treatments (including the use of combination chemotherapy regimens if they become resistant to single-agent therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The principle of sequential therapy utilizes one single agent initially, then an alternate single agent if resistance to the first drug develops (as determined by a plateau or re-elevation of the human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] level) during treatment. </p><p>The potential role of a second dilatation and curettage in lieu of chemotherapy has been evaluated in several studies, but the results have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. As discussed later in this section, a second curettage may be a reasonable option in lieu of chemotherapy in selected patients. However, the only randomized trial involved only 64 women. The study demonstrated surgical cure in 38 percent but progression in 55 percent, including two patients who developed lung metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Of note, because placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) are relatively resistant to chemotherapy, patients with nonmetastatic PSTT and ETT are generally treated with hysterectomy. Although there are case reports of selected patients treated successfully with local resection and preservation of fertility, hysterectomy remains the optimal treatment in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia#H473164634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Placental site or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor'</a> and <a href=\"#H453149243\" class=\"local\">'Patients with PSTT or ETT or who do not desire fertility preservation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582847\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the available agents, we administer MTX initially because it is effective, well tolerated, convenient for the patient, and cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/1,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-15</a>]. MTX has been administered in a variety of schedules with or without folinic acid (FA), which is used to protect from MTX-related toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of the regimens studied, in our practice, we administer MTX-FA as an eight-day regimen rather than other schedules because it is both effective and associated with minimal toxicities for the patient. We reviewed our experience with MTX-FA in 185 patients with low-risk GTN with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete remission was achieved in 88 percent, which includes 90 percent of patients with stage I disease and 68 percent of patients with stages II to III low-risk GTN. Notably, of 23 patients with MTX-resistant disease, 61 percent achieved remission with ActD, and the remaining 39 percent achieved remission with combination chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After three consecutive weeks of nondetectable hCG values, only two (1.2 percent) patients with nonmetastatic disease developed tumor recurrence. Resistance was more common in patients with choriocarcinoma, metastases, and pretreatment hCG levels of &gt;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span>. In a separate report, postmolar choriocarcinoma was an independent risk factor for chemotherapy resistance in low-risk GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two studies have investigated the potential influence of being overweight or obese as well as race on the clinical presentation and response to chemotherapy in low-risk GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The presence of overweightness or obesity did not affect the response to chemotherapy in low-risk GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While race did not influence the clinical presentation or extent of disease, Asian patients were significantly more likely to require second-line chemotherapy in low-risk GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The increased need for second-line chemotherapy in Asian patients was strictly due to chemotherapy resistance and not drug toxicity.</p><p/><p>In a separate study that included 250 patients, this regimen was associated with mild toxicity, and there were no cases of alopecia reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other findings of this study included that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea occurred in less than 15 percent of all treatment cycles, with vomiting seen in less than 5 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-fourth of all patients developed grade 1 or 2 mucositis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-fourth of these patients developed grade 1 or 2 conjunctivitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic toxicity was mild and infrequent, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurring in less than 1 percent of treatment cycles. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582853\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no universal consensus on the optimal dosing regimen for MTX. However, at our institution, we prefer the MTX-FA eight-day regimen for the primary therapy of low-risk GTN. In this regimen, MTX is dosed 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as an intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection and administered on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. FA is administered 24 hours after each dose of MTX to protect normal cells from potential treatment-related toxicity as a result of inhibition of folate metabolism induced by MTX. (See <a href=\"#H67582865\" class=\"local\">'Is there an optimal regimen?'</a> below.)</p><p>Other regimens that utilize MTX are often administered to this population. Given the lack of high-quality data comparing the different schedules for MTX administration, these are also reasonable options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MTX five-day regimen &ndash; The administration of MTX, 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> IM or IV, for five consecutive days every two weeks was originally described in 1956 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>] and is the regimen of choice at the Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center in Chicago (USA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other data emphasize that maintaining dose intensity is important to the efficacy of this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weekly MTX &ndash; Weekly IM injection of MTX at a dose of 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> has become a widely used regimen in the United States (US) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].<sup> </sup>Treatment is repeated until the serum hCG level becomes undetectable (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL),</span> after which consolidation therapy is recommended. This regimen was originally introduced under the auspices of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) as the most cost-effective among alternative regimens when efficiency, toxicity, and cost were taken into consideration. The main disadvantage of this regimen is the length of time it takes to achieve remission, which in some cases has taken up to 15 to 20 weekly treatments, particularly when used to treat patients with low-risk metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose MTX &ndash; High-dose infusion of MTX, 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>IV push followed by a 12-hour continuous infusion at 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> has also been used as initial therapy for patients with low-risk GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26</a>]. FA (15 mg dose) is administered orally beginning 24 hours after the start of the initial MTX dose and continued every 12 hours for six doses. Although this regimen is associated with a lower complete remission rate of 69 percent in patients with low-risk disease, it offers some advantages in terms of its shorter duration of treatment, which is particularly important for those patients who reside a long distance from the treating institution. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582865\"><span class=\"h4\">Is there an optimal regimen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no high-quality data to establish a universally applied standard regimen. However, the available data suggest that MTX administered on a five- or eight-day schedule is more effective than either the weekly IM or intermittent infusional IV infusion regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27</a>]. </p><p>Two retrospective case studies compared five-day MTX and eight-day MTX-FA protocols in patients with low-risk GTN, and one found no difference in remission rates of approximately 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Another study reported an only 72 percent remission rate in patients treated with MTX-FA as compared with a 92 percent remission rate in patients receiving MTX alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582871\"><span class=\"h2\">Actinomycin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We will generally administer ActD to patients who do not achieve remission to MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]; it is noted that these agents have been used in this sequence since 1965 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].<strong> </strong>Although some data support the administration of ActD in the initial treatment setting, it is more often used as second-line therapy in patients with MTX resistance, or when there are contraindications to the use of MTX due to the increased toxicity associated with ActD, particularly hyperemesis, alopecia, and the risk of local tissue injury if extravasation occurs. </p><p>Because of the issues associated with toxicity, ActD administered in &quot;pulsed&quot; dosing is generally used (1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> biweekly), although it can also be administered as an IV push (10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> daily for five days every other week). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. The primary remission rate for patients with nonmetastatic postmolar GTN is 78 and 88 percent for the pulsed and five-day regimens, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].<strong><sup> </sup></strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367387726\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate versus actinomycin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While we prefer MTX as initial therapy, there is no consensus regarding what should be the favored primary single-agent regimen in low-risk GTN. A number of different regimens utilizing MTX and ActD appear to have excellent activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97192 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Multiple trials have compared MTX and ActD regimens for treatment of low-risk, nonmetastatic GTN, including several randomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. A 2016 meta-analysis that included seven randomized controlled trials concluded that ActD was associated with higher cure rates than MTX (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.57-0.95), but possibly also with increased severe adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in this analysis due to the various schedules of MTX (as a weekly injection, five-day injection, and the eight-day schedule) and ActD (biweekly pulsed IV and the five-day IV dosing) included, and the number of patients included in the analysis was relatively small (n = 667). Therefore, we are not confident in the conclusiveness of this meta-analysis. One of the studies included in the meta-analysis, with 62 patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic disease, suggested similar complete remission rates between MTX and ActD (78 and 80 percent, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant). Additionally, frequency of adverse effects was similar between the two agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Both MTX and ActD are associated with hematologic toxicity, requiring that hematologic indices be carefully monitored during therapy. In addition, both agents are excreted by the kidney and as such, patients should have normal renal function confirmed prior to each treatment. MTX is hepatotoxic, however, so in the presence of abnormal liver function tests, ActD should be used preferentially. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67582877\"><span class=\"h2\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two other single agents are in use, primarily in Asia, for the treatment of patients with low-risk GTN: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etoposide</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Single-agent etoposide (VP-16) is an acceptable option for primary therapy for low-risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-low-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].
