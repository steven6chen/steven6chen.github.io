Potassium enters the body via oral intake or intravenous infusion, is largely stored in the cells, and then excreted in the urine. Thus, decreased intake, increased translocation into the cells, or, most often, increased losses in the urine, gastrointestinal tract, or sweat can lead to a reduction in the serum potassium concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62892 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the major causes of hypokalemia. The evaluation and treatment of hypokalemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with hypokalemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DECREASED POTASSIUM INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potassium intake is normally 40 to 120 mEq per day, most of which is then excreted in the urine. The kidney is able to lower potassium excretion to a minimum of 5 to 25 mEq per day in the presence of potassium depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, decreased intake alone rarely causes significant hypokalemia. This was demonstrated in a study of normal individuals in whom lowering potassium intake to 20 mEq per day was associated with a reduction in serum potassium from 4.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at baseline to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, a low potassium intake can contribute to the severity of potassium depletion when another cause of hypokalemia is superimposed, such as diuretic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED ENTRY INTO CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 98 percent of total body potassium is intracellular, chiefly in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The normal distribution of potassium between cells and the extracellular fluid is primarily maintained by the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alterations in other potassium transport pathways can result in transient hypokalemia due to increased potassium entry into cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17666515\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased availability of insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin promotes the entry of potassium into skeletal muscle and hepatic cells, predominantly by increasing the activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This effect is most prominent after the administration of exogenous insulin to patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or severe nonketotic hyperglycemia who are often normokalemic or hyperkalemic at presentation, even though they have lost potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Hypokalemia can rarely result from an insulin overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This has been described in patients with refeeding syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and after the administration of intravenous potassium in a dextrose in water solution.

Hypokalemia is an important cofactor in the <strong>maintenance</strong> of metabolic alkalosis since it promotes bicarbonate reabsorption, thereby impairing correction of the alkalemia by excretion of the excess bicarbonate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76787 \">figure 3</a>).

It may be hereditary, with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, or acquired in patients with hyperthyroidism. Acute attacks, in which the sudden movement of potassium into the cells can reduce the serum potassium to as low as 1.5 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> are often precipitated by rest after exercise, stress, or a carbohydrate meal. The serum potassium is normal during periods between the recurrent attacks of paralysis, a characteristic which can help distinguish periodic paralysis from other forms of hypokalemic paralysis. Patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis will also have a low urinary excretion of potassium; this finding can help distinguish these patients from those who have hypokalemic paralysis due to renal loss of potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

These patients with paradoxical hypokalemia had higher thyroxine concentrations, required more <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> supplementation to reverse symptoms of hypokalemia, and had more pronounced rebound hyperkalemia post-treatment. High thyroxine levels may produce a more exaggerated potassium uptake in these patients, resulting in paradoxical hypokalemia.</p><p>The mechanism of paradoxical hypokalemia is likely different in patients with nonperiodic hypokalemia. In a cohort of 58 such patients, paradoxical hypokalemia developed in 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The associated metabolic alkalosis and rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration increases the filtered bicarbonate load above its reabsorptive threshold. As a result, more <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> and water are delivered to the distal potassium secretory site. In combination with a hypovolemia-induced increase in aldosterone release, the net effect is increased potassium secretion and potentially large urinary potassium losses. Because of inappropriate sodium wasting with bicarbonate, a low urine chloride concentration is used to detect the presence of volume depletion.

In addition, hypokalemia due to lower gastrointestinal tract losses (usually from diarrhea) are typically associated with bicarbonate wasting and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis rather than the metabolic alkalosis observed with upper gastrointestinal losses. However, some patients with hypokalemia due to factitious diarrhea or surreptitious laxative abuse develop metabolic alkalosis via an uncertain mechanism.

This important concept is illustrated by the absence of hypokalemia in patients who have a compensatory increase in aldosterone due to volume depletion. In such cases, angiotensin II stimulates sodium reabsorption in the proximal and distal tubules, which indirectly reduces distal sodium and water delivery.

One potential explanation is the differential effect on calcium excretion. Whereas thiazide diuretics decrease calcium<sup> </sup>excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], loop diuretics lead to a significant increase in calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Thus, a stable patient with a normal serum potassium concentration at three weeks is not at risk of late hypokalemia unless the diuretic dose is increased, extrarenal potassium losses increase, or dietary potassium intake is reduced.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium intake is normally 40 to 120 mEq per day. Since the kidney can reduce potassium excretion to 5 to 25 mEq per day in the presence of potassium depletion, decreased intake alone rarely causes hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Decreased potassium intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total body potassium is predominantly intracellular, a distribution maintained principally by the Na-K-ATPase pump. Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alterations in other potassium transport pathways can result in hypokalemia due to increased potassium entry into cells. Common examples of this phenomenon include (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Increased entry into cells'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased insulin action (see <a href=\"#H17666515\" class=\"local\">'Increased availability of insulin'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevated beta-adrenergic activity (see <a href=\"#H17666854\" class=\"local\">'Elevated beta-adrenergic activity'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Elevated extracellular pH (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Elevated extracellular pH'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of gastric or intestinal secretions from any cause (vomiting, diarrhea, laxatives, or tube drainage) is associated with potassium losses and, possibly, hypokalemia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Upper gastrointestinal losses (eg, vomiting) lead to hypokalemia through urinary potassium wasting. This occurs because the metabolic alkalosis resulting from gastric acid loss increases the filtered bicarbonate load above its reabsorptive threshold. As a result, more <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> and water are delivered to the distal potassium secretory site. (See <a href=\"#H17667289\" class=\"local\">'Upper gastrointestinal losses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In contrast to gastric secretions, the potassium concentration in lower intestinal losses is relatively high. Hypokalemia due to lower gastrointestinal tract losses (usually from diarrhea) are typically associated with bicarbonate wasting and metabolic acidosis rather than the metabolic alkalosis observed with upper gastrointestinal losses. Hypokalemia from lower gastrointestinal losses is most common when the losses occur over a prolonged period. (See <a href=\"#H17667296\" class=\"local\">'Lower gastrointestinal losses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia from urinary potassium wasting usually requires either mineralocorticoid excess (often from an increase in aldosterone) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increase in distal flow. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Increased urinary losses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major causes of urinary potassium wasting include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diuretics &ndash; Any diuretic that acts proximal to the potassium secretory site will both increase distal delivery and, via the induction of volume depletion, activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. (See <a href=\"#H27627359\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased mineralocorticoid activity &ndash; Urinary potassium wasting is characteristic of any condition associated with primary hypersecretion of a mineralocorticoid, as with an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma. (See <a href=\"#H2791688\" class=\"local\">'Increased mineralocorticoid activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excretion of nonreabsorbable anions &ndash; When sodium is delivered to the distal nephron with relatively large quantities of a nonreabsorbable anion, such as bicarbonate or beta-hydroxybutyrate, more of the delivered sodium will be reabsorbed in exchange for potassium, leading to a potentially marked increase in potassium excretion. (See <a href=\"#H9060678\" class=\"local\">'Nonreabsorbable anions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia can occur in patients who sweat excessively, and in patients undergoing dialysis or plasmapheresis. (See <a href=\"#H25915988\" class=\"local\">'Increased sweat losses'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Plasmapheresis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">SQUIRES RD, HUTH EJ.
