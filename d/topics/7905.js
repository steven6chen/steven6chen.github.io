Several factors may contribute, including inadequate nutrition, metabolic acidosis, renal osteodystrophy, and insensitivity to the action of growth hormone (GH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>Management to prevent and correct growth impairment due to CKD includes supportive measures that correct amenable complications of CKD (eg, poor nutrition and metabolic acidosis) and renal replacement therapy (RRT), particularly renal transplantation. However, despite these interventions, poor growth persists in a significant proportion of children with CKD, including renal allograft recipients.

Persistent growth failure in this setting is primarily a result of reduced graft function and glucocorticoid therapy.

There is some debate concerning how this goal is defined. The therapeutic end point could either be attainment of the patient's individual target height (ie, the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of midparental height) or of a normal population-related final height (ie, greater than the third percentile or a Z-score &gt;-1.88). Although the former goal is certainly desirable for the individual patient, the latter approach may be economically more acceptable in view of the high cost of rhGH therapy (approximately USD $30,000 per patient per year). In our practice, the minimal therapeutic goal is a height greater than the third percentile of the general population.</p><p>It is important to monitor the growth of all children with CKD. When there is a reduction of growth velocity below normal values based on age and gender, an evaluation should be performed to identify and correct any amenable risk factors that contribute to growth impairment, such as inadequate nutrition or metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Data from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) and clinical trials have demonstrated that there is often a delay in initiation of rhGH in children who were already growth-retarded (height Z-score &lt;-1.88) before rhGH is started. Even with rhGH therapy, some of these patients did not have sufficient catch-up growth to obtain normal population-related final height. As a result, early initiation of therapy is advocated for patients who meet the criteria for rhGH therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H162284220\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictors for growth response to rhGH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first and second year of treatment, age, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), target height (ie, midparental height), and prior growth rates are independent predictors of the response to rhGH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/23,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,45</a>]. Height velocity negatively correlates with increasing age and positively correlates with higher renal function and target height. Factors that positively impact final adult stature include height Z-score at initiation of therapy and duration of rhGH therapy, and those with adverse effects include increasing time on dialysis, delayed puberty, and the age at the start of rhGH.</p><p>These data suggest that earlier intervention at a younger age (before six years of age) and early in the course of CKD leads to a more robust response to rhGH and is more likely to result in achieving the goal of a normal final height. In particular, the use of rhGH appears to be most beneficial in infants who are most likely to achieve successful catch-up growth.

These include insufficient nutrition, metabolic acidosis, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy.

This is given daily by subcutaneous injection. Although data are limited, the previously discussed meta-analysis showed that this dose (defined as a cumulative weekly amount of 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/week</span> per m<sup>2</sup> body surface area in the systematic review) resulted in a higher growth velocity than a lower dose of 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/week</span> per m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (mean difference of 1.18 cm per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The amount of rhGH given to children with CKD is greater than what is normally given to growth hormone (GH)-deficient children.

However, subcutaneous injection of rhGH is not well accepted by some children. As a result, in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), rhGH is administered by installing it into the dialysis fluid, analogous to insulin treatment in diabetic patients. Preliminary data indicate adequate absorption of rhGH via the intraperitoneal route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, the growth-promoting efficacy of intraperitoneal GH appears to be less consistent than that observed with subcutaneous rhGH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of rhGH therapy is for children with CKD to attain normal final height. The minimal therapeutic aim should be a height greater than the third percentile of the general population. (See <a href=\"#H170177130\" class=\"local\">'Goal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend rhGH be initiated in children with CKD when the following criteria have been met (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All other amenable risk factors for growth impairment have been addressed.

The dose of rhGH is greater than what is normally given to GH-deficient children, as children with CKD require pharmacologic rather than replacement dosing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Dose of rhGH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate growth response is defined as a growth velocity that is greater than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> over the baseline rate prior to rhGH therapy. In patients who fail to have an adequate response, evaluation consists of assessments of patient compliance, correct dosing, and whether there are contributing factors to growth impairment.
