Preexisting infections in individuals with IRIS may have been previously diagnosed and treated or they may be subclinical and unmasked by the host's regained capacity to mount an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>If immune function improves rapidly following the commencement of ART, systemic or local inflammatory reactions may occur at the site or sites of the preexisting infection. This inflammatory reaction is usually self-limited, especially if the preexisting infection is effectively treated. However, long-term sequelae and fatal outcomes may rarely occur, particularly when neurologic structures are involved.</p><p>This topic focuses on the immunobiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of IRIS. Topic reviews that discuss when to initiate ART are presented separately.

Similar illnesses have also occurred in some HIV-uninfected patients following corticosteroid withdrawal, discontinuation of antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy, recovery of neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy, withdrawal of immunosuppression in transplant recipients infected with <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, and engraftment of stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection produces both quantitative and qualitative time-dependent deleterious effects on the immune system. The likelihood and severity of IRIS correlates with two interrelated factors: 1) the extent of CD4+ T cell immune suppression prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 2) the degree of viral suppression and immune recovery following the initiation of ART.</p><p>As the half-life of HIV is generally between one and four days, ART may produce a greater than 90 percent reduction in the overall HIV viral burden within one to two weeks of starting treatment. This decline in viral load usually persists during the next 8 to 12 weeks and then stabilizes. Declines in the viral load are even faster with integrase strand transfer inhibitors. An increase in immune effector cells occurs in inverse proportion to the fall in HIV viral load in most treated individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The typical recovery of CD4+ T lymphocyte count following initiation of ART is biphasic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. A rapid increase in CD4+ cells occurs during the first three to six months of ART. This initial rise is mainly due to an increase in the numbers of CD45RO+ memory T cells and is presumed to be due to a combination of decreased lymphocyte apoptosis and simultaneous redistribution of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid tissues into the circulation. Thereafter, a slower increase of predominately naive CD4+ T cells (CD45RA+, CD62L+) occurs in most treated individuals. This secondary increase in CD4+ T cells is thought to be due to expansion of T cell clones produced by the thymus prior to its age-related functional decline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occurs secondary to thymopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. CD8+ T lymphocytes also increase rapidly after the initiation of ART. However, the total numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes eventually stabilize as memory CD8+ cells subsequently decline and are replaced by naive CD8+ T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Increases in T lymphocytes after initiation of ART are also accompanied by increased in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses, increased markers of immune activation, and pathogen-specific delayed hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/18,19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,23,24</a>]. As an example, one group of investigators studying a small group of HIV-infected patients demonstrated that inducible lymphocyte proliferation increased almost threefold after three weeks of ART, ultimately rose fourfold, then stabilized for the next two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation against Candida antigens as well as increases in stimulation indices with CMV antigens and tuberculin also typically occur after initiation of ART in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. Another study demonstrated that 90 percent of HIV-infected patients had cutaneous anergy prior to starting ART; 12 weeks later, 30 percent of these patients had recovered their ability to respond to skin test antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR IRIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no universally agreed-upon definition for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (&quot;paradoxical&quot; IRIS) or unrecognized preexisting infection (&quot;unmasking&quot; IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Most or all of the following features should be present in order to make the diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of AIDS with a low pretreatment CD4 count (often less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. One important exception to this general rule is tuberculosis.

Patients taking newer, potentially more virologically potent ART regimens, including integrase inhibitors, may develop IRIS earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>When a diagnosis of IRIS is considered highly likely, further or repeated invasive diagnostic procedures to locate an occult infection may be reasonably delayed, deferred, or altogether avoided. However, localized drainage (with appropriate cultures) is indicated for symptomatic relief of mycobacterial lymphadenitis as well as for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Although the hypersensitivity reaction seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> may be difficult to distinguish from systemic IRIS, this complication of abacavir is exceedingly rare in individuals negative for HLA-B*57:01. Prevention, diagnosis, and management of abacavir hypersensitivity is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-hypersensitivity-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is broad and includes progression of the initial opportunistic infection (OI) due to antimicrobial resistance or nonadherence to prescribed drug regimens, development of a new OI, or drug toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early retrospective case series studies suggested that up to 30 percent of patients who responded to antiretroviral therapy (ART) developed one or more inflammatory syndromes consistent with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. However, subsequent data have suggested that the incidence is probably much lower, particularly in patients where ART was initiated before severe CD4 decline occurs.</p><p>Data from prospective and retrospective studies suggest that the incidence of IRIS following ART is largely dependent on two things: 1) the likelihood of a preexisting opportunistic infection and 2) the likelihood of a viral and immunologic response to ART. The following studies illustrate the incidence of cases that have been reported in a variety of settings and the range of infections that have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of about 13,000 HIV patients, 13 percent of subjects developed IRIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In addition, some patients with Kaposi sarcoma have developed an IRIS-like syndrome when antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/31,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,45,46</a>], and other patients have developed Grave's thyrotoxicosis or recurrence of sarcoidosis after starting ART.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have demonstrated that lower CD4 cell counts or high HIV RNA at the time of treatment initiation increase the risk of developing an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/2,26-28,31,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26-28,31,47</a>]. Response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) also plays an important role in predicting risk. </p><p>In one prospective trial of 282 patients with AIDS-related OIs, the risk of IRIS was related to low CD4 counts at baseline (HR = 0.79 per 10 additional CD4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) and degree of immunologic improvement on ART (HR = 1.08 per additional 10 CD4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similarly, the risk of IRIS was also associated with a higher level of viremia at baseline (HR = 2.5 per 1 log increase in HIV RNA; 95% CI 1.19, 5.21) and the degree of viral decline on ART (HR = 0.43 per 1 log increase in HIV RNA; 95% CI 0.24, 0.78). Fungal infections (except for Pneumocystis) were also associated with an increased risk of IRIS in the multivariate analysis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) develop symptoms within one week to a few months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The clinical features of IRIS are strongly related to the type and location of preexisting opportunistic infection. Furthermore, preexisting infections may or may not be clinically apparent prior to the initiation of ART. Since the clinical features of IRIS vary so widely, IRIS due to specific pathogens are discussed in the sections that follow. However, a few generalizations can be made. Symptoms of IRIS can be localized or systemic. About three-fourths of patients with mycobacterial or cryptococcal-related immune reconstitution syndromes develop fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, fever occurs infrequently in IRIS related to previously recognized or subclinical infection with cytomegalovirus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">IRIS associated with mycobacterial infections</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H743844635\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with tuberculosis, IRIS may be associated with initiation of antituberculosis therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-infected-adults-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the widespread emergence of HIV infection, an IRIS-like paradoxical inflammatory response was known to occur in some patients treated for tuberculosis (TB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/10-12,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,48</a>]. Paradoxical clinical deterioration in HIV-uninfected patients with pulmonary TB following the initiation of antituberculous therapy is assumed to be a self-limited phenomenon in most cases.</p><p>The paradoxical reaction that follows the commencement of antituberculosis therapy for pulmonary TB is usually characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and worsening respiratory symptoms. Transient worsening of radiographic abnormalities, including new parenchymal opacities and progressive intrathoracic lymph node enlargement may also occur in such patients. Rarely pulmonary involvement may progress to severe respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome. </p><p>Patients with extrapulmonary TB may develop worsening lymphadenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/10,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,49</a>], new pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], the reappearance of fever with new infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], or expansion of preexisting intracranial tuberculomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/11,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,53-55</a>] after antituberculosis therapy is begun. Aspiration of fluctuant lymph nodes often reveals purulent material, but mycobacterial cultures are typically sterile and acid fast stains yield relatively few or no organisms. When mycobacteria are recovered in patients with paradoxical reactions, these organisms usually have not developed new antituberculous drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism for paradoxical reactions is not well understood, but it appears to be immune mediated. Changes in the ability to respond to tuberculin proteins occur in some patients following the initiation of antituberculous therapy. For example, in one study, 74 percent of patients who were initially anergic had reversion of their previously negative tuberculin skin tests within two weeks of starting antituberculous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The incidence of paradoxical reactions in HIV-uninfected patients may be higher in patients who develop TB while receiving the immunomodulator <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of paradoxical worsening associated with pulmonary TB is higher in HIV-infected individuals following ART initiation compared with those who are not coinfected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study paradoxical inflammatory reactions were documented in 12 of 33 patients (36 percent) coinfected with HIV and treated with ART, but similar reactions occurred in only 1 of 55 patients (2 percent) without HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A retrospective review found severe transient worsening of chest radiograph appearance in 7 of 31 patients (23 percent) who were coinfected with HIV and TB and treated for both, and in 2 of 56 patients (4 percent; 26 patients with HIV coinfection and 30 patients without HIV) who were only receiving therapy for TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a retrospective cohort of 144 HIV patients with TB coinfection, 11 (8 percent) had a paradoxical reaction after a median time of 47 days following ART initiation and an incidence rate of 15 cases per 100 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Patients who are coinfected with TB and HIV may also develop IRIS that manifests as tuberculous lymphadenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], cutaneous lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], epididymitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], bowel perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], or granulomatous nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The time interval from initiation of ART to the onset of IRIS associated with TB has varied from 10 to 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but tends to occur within the first 60 days of starting ART therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/6,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688565596\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycobacterium avium complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients coinfected with HIV and <em>M. avium complex</em> (MAC) may develop inflammatory reactions following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68538 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69627\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69627 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70875\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70875 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>].
