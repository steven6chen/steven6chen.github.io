If a testis develops, the urogenital tract becomes male in character, and if an ovary (or no gonad) is present, the urogenital tract is female in character [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. So, in essence, there are three sequential but interdependent processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of chromosomal (genetic) sex at fertilization, with XY as male and XX as female. For the first six weeks of human gestation, the two sexes develop in an apparently identical fashion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of gonadal sex with the development of the indifferent gonad and its subsequent differentiation into an ovary or a testis, beginning around week 6, followed by secretion of hormones by the fetal testes. The fetal ovary is apparently hormonally silent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of sexual phenotypes when the sexually indifferent anlagen of the urogenital tract develop into characteristic male or female structures. This process is largely completed by week 12 in the male and somewhat later in the female.</p><p/><p>These steps have to occur in a stringent and time-dependent manner to allow an individual to develop into a normal male or female. This prenatal sexual development is a prerequisite for the postnatal maturation of the two sexes. While the prenatal development largely depends on the development of testicular tissue and the secretion and action of testosterone, postnatal development is driven by both estrogens and androgens (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>). The sexual dimorphism is then a major determinant for further development of the individual and its capacity for reproduction but also for sex-related differences in health and disease. Examples for this are differences in the occurrence of defined disorders but also variations in responses to pharmacologic treatment.</p><p>This model of sex development is challenged to some extent because of observations in animals, where the sexually dimorphic composition of organs such as the brain is determined, at least in part, by genetic factors and apparently independent of gonadal hormone action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In humans, this is still under debate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotypic differentiation of the female and male urogenital tracts is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78289 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal urogenital tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal urogenital tracts arise from sexually indifferent gonads and two sets of ducts, the Wolffian and M&uuml;llerian ducts that are present in early embryos of both sexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78289 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In females, the gonads become ovaries; the M&uuml;llerian ducts give rise to the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina, and the Wolffian ducts persist in vestigial form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In males, the gonads become testes; the Wolffian ducts give rise to the epididymides, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts, and the M&uuml;llerian ducts regress.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">External genitalia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external genitalia in the two sexes develop from common anlagen: the genital tubercle, the genital swellings, and the genital folds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65480\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65480 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In females, the genital tubercle becomes the clitoris, the genital swellings become the labia majora, and the genital folds become the labia minora.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In males, the genital swellings fuse to become the scrotum, and the genital folds elongate and fuse to form the shaft of the penis and the penile urethra, which terminates in the glans penis formed from the genital tubercle. Prostatic buds develop in the wall of the proximal urethra and elongate and arborize to form the prostate. Testicular descent takes place in the latter part of gestation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadal development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of genes have been identified that are essential for differentiation of both ovaries and testes. These genes include <em>Emx2</em>, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">Igf1r/Irr/Ir</em>,</span> <em>Lhx9</em>, <em>M33</em>, <em>Nr5a1</em>, and <em>Wt1</em> as well as others; homozygous deletion of these genes in mice causes failure of development or early regression of the gonads in both sexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91471 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1045121354\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL MALE DEVELOPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Testicular determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The critical region of the Y chromosome that directs development of the testes has been established with the identification of the <em>SRY</em> (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) gene, which causes the indifferent gonad to develop into a testis. Insertion of this single gene as a transgene into female animals is sufficient to cause development of a testis and mature male phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91471 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Evidence suggests that the fundamental effect of <em>SRY</em> to stimulate testis development is suppression of ovarian development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <em>SRY</em> is also believed to activate a series of additional downstream genes to promote development of the Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and the spermatogenic tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Transcription factors involved include SOX-9, WT-1, DAX-1, and in particular, Desert hedgehog (DHH) from Sertoli cells, which in turn is involved in Leydig cell differentiation through transcriptional control of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91471 \">figure 3</a>). Mutations in these factors are increasingly detected in patients with 46,XY partial and complete gonadal dysgenesis and give new insight into the normal and unusual development of the testes and the Sertoli-Leydig cell interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of the male phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadal sex is translated into male phenotypic sex primarily by the secretion of three hormones from the fetal testes: anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH, also called M&uuml;llerian-inhibiting hormone [MIH] and M&uuml;llerian-inhibiting substance [MIS]), testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (which is produced by peripheral conversion from testicular testosterone). The net effect of these hormones is regression of the M&uuml;llerian ducts and promotion of development of the male urogenital tract and external genitalia. Testicular descent depends on a variety of anatomical and endocrine factors. In addition to AMH and testosterone, the insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) plays a role in the inguinal phase of testicular descent. INSL3 presumably controls gubernaculum differentiation, which is involved in the connection of the testes via the epididymis to the structures of the inguinal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AMH, a glycoprotein formed by Sertoli cells of the fetal testis beginning at approximately six weeks of development, causes regression of the M&uuml;llerian ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone, secreted by the fetal testes beginning at approximately the eighth week of development, directly stimulates Wolffian duct differentiation into epididymides, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78289 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<strong><em> </em></strong>This is initially controlled by the placental human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and only during later development by the luteinizing hormone (LH) of the fetal pituitary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dihydrotestosterone, formed by 5-alpha-reduction of testosterone, regulates development of the prostate and male external genitalia during embryogenesis, which is complete by the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The importance of dihydrotestosterone formation for normal male sexual differentiation was suggested by studies of testosterone metabolism in embryonic tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and proven by the observation that steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency impairs development of the male external genitalia in humans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgen action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to virilization of the Wolffian ducts during embryogenesis, the testosterone-receptor complex plays a role in feedback regulation of LH secretion by the pituitary and the androgen-dependent component of spermatogenesis. Dihydrotestosterone formation serves as an amplification mechanism for androgen action. It binds to the receptor with greater affinity and activates reporter genes in vitro more efficiently than testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-reproductive-physiology#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male reproductive physiology&quot;, section on 'Androgen synthesis, transport, metabolism, and action'</a>.)</p><p>Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone bind to the same intracellular androgen receptor (AR), a member of the steroid-thyroid-retinoid superfamily of transcription regulatory factors, in a very specific manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The androgen receptor contains DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains in the C-terminal portion of the protein and a region in the N-terminal region important for transactivation of the target gene. The androgen-AR complex is dependent on a variety of proteins involved in its shuttling towards the nucleus, the unraveling and binding of the target DNA, and in the transduction of the complex to activate or repress target DNA transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Androgen action appears to play a major role in body composition, even in the neonate, as birth weight correlates with androgenization status rather than chromosomal sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in one study of children with disorders of sex development (DSDs), differences in birth weight could not be explained by fetal androgen action alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The effects of embryonal androgenization on specific parts of the body are also not so obvious and are incompletely understood. In particular, the study of biological effects on gender identity is challenging for lack of experimental designs and for ethical issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-reproductive-physiology#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male reproductive physiology&quot;, section on 'Androgen synthesis, transport, metabolism, and action'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1045121382\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL FEMALE DEVELOPMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of testicular determining factors, WNT4 and R spondin 1 (Rspo1) are required for development of the ovary; they suppress SOX9 to allow formation of a fetal ovary. <span class=\"nowrap\">Rspo1/Wnt-4/beta-catenin</span> signaling is repressed by the presence of <em>SRY</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91471 \">figure 3</a>). Evidence for this comes from experimental studies of mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] and human mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sexual-development/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If male development is not initiated, ovarian development will occur around week 10, and consequently, the female phenotype will develop due to lack of androgen influence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of the female phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of testes (as in normal females or when both gonads are missing), the development of phenotypic sex is female. Thus, female development is independent of hormones of the fetal ovary. However, embryogenesis takes place in the presence of many hormones derived from the placenta, the maternal circulation, the fetal adrenal, the fetal testis, and possibly the fetal ovary. Because the embryo develops in the &quot;female environment&quot; of the mother, it has not been possible to devise a definitive experiment to determine whether any of these hormones are essential for female development.</p><p>The internal female reproductive tract is formed from the M&uuml;llerian ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78289 \">figure 1</a>). The cephalic portions of the M&uuml;llerian ducts develop into the fallopian tubes and the caudal portions fuse to form the uterus. At the site of contact of the M&uuml;llerian ducts with the urogenital sinus, a proliferation of endodermal cells forms the uterovaginal plate, which eventually canalizes to form the lumen of the vagina. In contrast to the male, in which the urogenital sinus is enclosed by fusion of the genital folds, most of the urogenital sinus of the female remains exposed on the surface as a cleft into which the vagina and urethra open. The urogenital tubercle forms the clitoris.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex and gender development in humans is tightly controlled by genetic factors inducing organ, especially gonadal development, and mainly androgen-dependent programming in a tissue-specific, spatial- and time-limited fashion.
