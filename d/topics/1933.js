The mechanisms of signal transduction from this receptor and the potential role of beta-2 adrenergic receptor dysfunction in the pathogenesis of asthma and its response to therapy will be reviewed here. The clinical use of beta agonists in the treatment of asthma is discussed separately.

It encodes a protein that is a member of the large family of G-protein coupled, seven transmembrane-spanning domain receptors. The receptor is expressed on a variety of cell types in the lung, including airway smooth muscle and epithelial cells, vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes.</p><p>Stimulation of the beta-2 receptor results in activation of the associated G-protein, Gs, which dissociates to release a protein subunit, free Gs-alpha. Gs-alpha in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, resulting in a rise in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels. Most of the intracellular effects of beta-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation are due to the elevation in cyclic AMP and consequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA); there may also be direct, cyclic AMP-independent effects of Gs-alpha on the calcium-activated potassium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Phosphorylation of the receptor, either by PKA-dependent pathways or by activation of one of a family of G-protein receptor kinases termed beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta-ARKs), leads to reduced coupling with the intracellular signaling pathway following agonist stimulation. Different tissues vary in the degree of uncoupling seen with prolonged agonist exposure, probably due to differences in the amount and activity of beta-ARK <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PKA in different cell types.</p><p>The number of receptors also is actively regulated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2 receptor number is reduced after exposure to agonist for more than two hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2 adrenoceptor expression in airway cells is downregulated after exposure to viruses or to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2 receptor number is increased by in vitro exposure to glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RECEPTOR DYSFUNCTION IN ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility that medication-induced changes in beta receptor density or signal transduction impact detrimentally upon asthma control has been repeatedly suggested in the literature, although supporting evidence has been scant.

A genome wide association study (GWAS) identified a region on chromosome 2 that is associated with a decreased bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-2 agonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A large number of studies have examined the effect of scheduled treatment with short-acting beta-2 agonists on asthma control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/13-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-21</a>]. The majority of these reports found NO significant deterioration in symptoms, lung function, or the need for rescue medications. Several studies demonstrated a small deterioration in symptom score, FEV<sub>1</sub>, or response to bronchoprovocation when beta agonists were used regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/2,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,21</a>], and rebound hyperresponsiveness has been noted following beta agonist withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

These polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium in populations studied to date, but the frequency of the different variants varies between ethnic groups. Each individual has two genes for the beta-2 adrenergic receptor and hence can be heterozygous or homozygous for each polymorphism.</p><p>Nine point mutations have been found within the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene, although only four result in amino acid substitutions because of redundancy in the amino acid translation code.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arginine to glycine 16 and glutamine to glutamate 27 substitutions are common in the Caucasian population; allele frequencies at each locus are between 0.3 and 0.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In an in vitro study, homozygosity of Gly 16 resulted in greater downregulation (96 percent) and homozygosity of Glu 27 in less downregulation (29 percent) of the beta-2 receptor in response to agonists than occurred with the wild type (78 percent), although agonist binding kinetics were not affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Both the codon 16 and codon 27 polymorphisms are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the general population.
