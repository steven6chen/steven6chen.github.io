It has a major impact on healthcare costs in the United States because it results in several office visits, specialty referrals, hospital admissions, and surgical procedures. It also affects health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of constipation in the older adult. The approach to diagnosis and management of constipation in children and adults in general are presented separately.

The above criteria must be fulfilled for the last three months with symptom onset six months prior to diagnosis, loose stools should rarely be present without the use of laxatives, and there must be insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29212422\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have reported that the prevalence of constipation in the older adult ranges from 24 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>].

We recommend routine laboratory testing in older adults with constipation. However, American College of Gastroenterology guidelines state that in patients with chronic constipation without alarm symptoms or signs (hematochezia, weight loss &ge;10 pounds, family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, anemia, positive fecal occult blood tests, acute onset of constipation in older adults, and severe persistent constipation that is unresponsive to treatment), there are inadequate data to make a recommendation about the routine use of laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684048\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data to support the role of imaging in the evaluation of constipation in the older adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684949\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A colonoscopy allows for direct visualization of the colon to exclude mucosal lesions (eg, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, inflammation, malignancy) and should be performed in patients if they have alarm symptoms and also as indicated for colorectal cancer screening.

These tests are generally reserved for patients with chronic constipation who do not respond to therapy with lifestyle and dietary modifications and a trial of bulk forming and osmotic laxatives.

Bulk laxatives are recommended in patients who do not respond to lifestyle and dietary modification. A trial of osmotic laxatives should be considered in patients not responding to bulk laxatives. In patients who fail a trial of osmotic laxatives, colon secretagogues (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a>) should be considered. Stimulant laxatives are efficacious, but chronic use should be avoided as the long-term safety in older adults is not known. Stool softeners and suppositories (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a>) have limited clinical efficacy. Enemas should only be used to prevent fecal impaction in patients with several days of constipation. Opioid antagonists may have a role in treatment of narcotic-induced constipation and paralytic ileus. In patients with dyssynergic defecation, biofeedback therapy may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684093\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General measures such as increased fluid intake and exercise are suggested to treat constipation, but there is little evidence to support this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a small study of healthy volunteers, consumption of extra fluid was not associated with an increase in stool output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>It is advisable to encourage patients to establish a regular pattern of bowel movement. Most patients who have a normal bowel pattern usually empty stools at approximately the same time every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This fact suggests that the initiation of defecation is in part a conditioned reflex. Colonic motor activity is more active after waking and after a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, the optimal time for bowel movement is usually within the first two hours after waking and after breakfast. Other general measures include timed toilet training that consists of educating patients to attempt a bowel movement at least twice a day, usually 30 minutes after meals, and to strain for no more than five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29212541\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiber increases stool bulk, which causes colonic distention and promotes stool propulsion. A daily fiber intake of 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> is generally recommended. The effects of fiber on bowel movements may take several weeks.

They are natural or synthetic polysaccharides or cellulose derivatives that primarily exert their laxative effect by absorbing water and increasing fecal mass. These laxatives are effective in increasing the frequency and softening the consistency of stool with a minimum of adverse effects. They may be used alone or in combination with an increase in dietary fiber.</p><p>Despite substantial anecdotal clinical experience indicating benefit for bulk forming laxatives, objective evidence regarding the effectiveness is inconsistent. A systematic review found evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> increases stool frequency in patients with chronic constipation but found insufficient evidence for other forms of fiber including calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polycarbophil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>, and bran [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The FDA stated that individuals at higher risk for potential adverse effects when the recommended dose is exceeded include individuals older than 55 years, patients with dehydration, bowel obstruction, or inflammation, and patients with kidney disease or on medication that may affect renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29212562\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies for chronic constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several agents have been studied or are undergoing further studies for the treatment of chronic constipation.

In two large phase 3 trials of patients with chronic constipation, the linaclotide treated groups (both 145 microgram and 290 microgram) had significantly higher rates of three or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week and an increase in one or more CSBMs from baseline during at least 9 out of 12 weeks as compared with placebo (145 micrograms: 21 and 16 percent, 290 micrograms: 19 and 21 percent, versus placebo: 3 and 6 percent). The most common and dose-related adverse event was diarrhea that led to discontinuation of treatment in 4 percent of patients in both linaclotide-treated groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although linaclotide has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, the long-term risks and benefits of linaclotide, especially in older adults, remain to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Patients are guided to improve control of these muscles by electromyographic surface electrodes on an anal plug and an abdominal wall surface electrode. For patients with pelvic floor<strong> </strong>dysfunction, particularly dyssynergic defecation, biofeedback therapy should be considered.</p><p>Four randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of biofeedback therapy in the treatment of dyssynergic defecation and concluded that biofeedback is consistently superior to laxatives, standard therapy, sham therapy, placebo, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/constipation-in-the-older-adult/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. Trials are needed to establish the efficacy of biofeedback in older adults. Until then an individualized assessment of the physical and mental capacity of the older adult is important in evaluating the potential efficacy of biofeedback.

Fecal impaction results largely from the person's inability to sense and respond to the presence of stool in the rectum. Decreased mobility and lowered sensory perception are common causes of fecal impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523121865\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of fecal impaction is confirmed by performing a digital rectal examination. The impacted stool is not necessarily hard, but the key to the diagnosis of fecal impaction is in finding a copious amount of stool in the rectum. It is important to note that fecal impactions can occur in the proximal rectum or sigmoid colon, and a digital rectal examination will be nondiagnostic. If the clinical suspicion for a fecal impaction is high, an abdominal radiograph should be obtained to detect fecal loading in the absence of a rectal impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523121835\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of a suspected perforation or massive bleeding, the management of fecal impactions involves disimpaction and colon evacuation, followed by the implementation of a maintenance bowel regimen to prevent recurrent impactions. We suggest<strong> </strong>digital disimpaction to fragment a large fecal bolus to facilitate its passage through the anal canal. Subsequently a warm-water enema with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> may be administered to soften the impaction and assist emptying of stool from the rectum and distal colon. Once the distal colon has been partially emptied with disimpaction and enemas, polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be administered orally or by a nasogastric tube.</p><p>If the above measures fail, local anesthesia to relax the anal canal and pelvic floor muscles, together with abdominal massage, can help to pass the stool bolus. In rare cases, it may be necessary to use a colonoscope with a snare to fragment fecal material in the distal colon. In such cases, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> enema prior to the colonoscopy may help to soften the stool bolus. If such measures fail or if there is significant abdominal tenderness suggestive of an impending perforation or ischemia, surgery may be necessary.</p><p>Following management of an acute impaction, it is important to identify and eliminate potential causes of constipation. This includes discontinuing medications that cause or exacerbate constipation. For the institutionalized adult, improving availability of toileting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> providing assistance is necessary to prevent constipation. Regular use of medications that treat constipation in the older adult is discussed above.

(See <a href=\"#H29212415\" class=\"local\">'Definition of constipation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation in the older adult may be due to functional chronic constipation or secondary to other etiologic factors.<br/><br/>Primary colorectal dysfunction consists of three overlapping subtypes: slow transit constipation, dyssynergic defecation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Secondary causes of constipation should be excluded with a thorough history and physical examination followed by diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"#H29212429\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29212464\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first step in the treatment of chronic functional constipation is with lifestyle and dietary modification.
