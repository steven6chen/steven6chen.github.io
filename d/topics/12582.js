Within this category, tumors from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. This heterogeneity has made the design and interpretation of clinical studies difficult.</p><p>Patients with CUPs typically present with symptoms referable to metastases. The initial work-up, including physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging procedures, often fails to identify the primary site.</p><p>Patients are initially placed into one of four categories based upon the light microscopic examination of the initial biopsy. This classification is then used to guide further evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenocarcinoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroendocrine carcinoma, which may be either well differentiated or poorly differentiated</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly differentiated tumors, most of which are recognized as carcinomas by histologic examination. Less frequently, the lineage (carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma, germ cell tumor) is unclear after light microscopic examination.</p><p/><p>These histologic groups vary with respect to clinical characteristics, diagnostic approach, treatment, and prognosis. An overview of these issues for each subset is presented here, and the evaluation and treatment of each of these subgroups is discussed in more detail separately. (See appropriate topics as noted below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial work-up of patients presenting with a presumed CUP should not be exhaustive. Instead, the evaluation for likely primary sites should focus on those tumor types where specific therapy can have a positive impact on the clinical outcome.</p><p>This initial evaluation should include, at a minimum, a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count, urinalysis, basic serum chemistries, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In women, the evaluation should include a pelvic examination and mammography. In men, assessment should incorporate a prostate examination and measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA).</p><p>The choice of further diagnostic procedures that are likely to clarify the diagnosis depends upon the interpretation of the initial biopsy sample.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOCARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site constitute approximately 70 percent of CUPs. The clinical presentation of patients with adenocarcinoma is determined by the sites of tumor involvement, which frequently include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bones. Initial clinical studies should focus primarily on determining the extent of metastatic disease and should incorporate the information derived from specialized pathologic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In autopsy series of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site, the most frequently identified malignancies were lung, pancreas, hepatobiliary tree, and kidney, together accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, tumors arising from a wide variety of other primary sites were also identified. Adenocarcinomas of the breast and prostate were infrequently identified in autopsy series, despite being the most common cancers in women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Several studies are useful in identifying the anatomic primary site and thus guiding therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal computed tomography (CT), which suggests a specific primary site in 10 to 35 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) determination in men. Tumors can also be stained immunohistochemically to detect the presence of PSA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with axillary lymphadenopathy compatible with metastatic breast cancer. Immunochemical staining may detect the expression of breast cancer-specific markers such as estrogen and progesterone receptors, mammaglobin, and gross cystic duct fluid protein in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Axillary node metastases with occult primary breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Initial diagnostic workup'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in specific clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] but in most patients does not add substantially to the information obtained by CT scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional signs or symptoms, such as a positive test for occult blood in stool, should be evaluated with appropriate radiographic or endoscopic studies. Colonoscopy should also be performed in patients with intra-abdominal metastases (liver, peritoneum) and pathologic findings <span class=\"nowrap\">(histology/immunohistochemistry)</span> typical of colon cancer, even in the absence of symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. However, routine endoscopic evaluation of the upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower gastrointestinal tract has a low yield in other asymptomatic patients, although occult primary lesions are occasionally identified.</p><p/><p>Improved diagnostic methods should also be used to predict a tissue of tumor origin, although an anatomic primary tumor is not usually identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunohistochemistry, which may facilitate the identification of specific cancer types such as breast cancer or colorectal carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene expression profiling of tumors, using a commercially available assay, predicts the tissue of origin in most patients, and has recently been shown to be useful in guiding site-specific therapy.</p><p/><p>Common tumor markers (carcinoma embryonic antigen [CEA], CA 19-9, CA 15-3, CA-125) generally are not useful as either diagnostic or prognostic tests. Markers are often elevated in the serum of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site, and serial measurement may be useful in following the response to therapy for individual tumors.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroendocrine neoplasms of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2000 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system divides these tumors into low-grade and high-grade malignancies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma &ndash; Metastatic carcinoid or islet cell tumors occasionally present without an obvious primary site, usually with liver metastases. In some patients, primary sites can subsequently be identified in the intestine or pancreas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma &ndash; Most patients with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma have an aggressive malignancy, usually with metastases in multiple sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum are frequently involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patients in this group have metastatic small cell anaplastic carcinoma, which often represents a primary bronchogenic malignancy. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy usually can identify the primary site. Small cell carcinomas have also been described arising in a wide range of extrapulmonary sites include the salivary glands, esophagus, bladder, ovary, prostate, and cervix, among others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary small cell cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other high-grade neuroendocrine malignancies appear histologically as poorly differentiated carcinomas and are identifiable as neuroendocrine carcinomas only when immunohistochemical stains are performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is uncommon in the absence of an obvious primary tumor, except for patients who present with a neck mass. Overall, these constitute about 5 percent of CUPs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation and subsequent diagnostic evaluation of patients with squamous carcinoma of unknown primary site depends upon the predominant area of the metastasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper and midcervical lymphadenopathy &ndash; Upper and midcervical lymphadenopathy most frequently is due to cancer of the head and neck. Further evaluation should include computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck, direct laryngoscopy, and nasopharyngoscopy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning should be performed if a primary site cannot be identified by CT or endoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inguinal lymphadenopathy &ndash; Most patients with SCC involving inguinal lymph nodes have a detectable primary site in the genital or anorectal area. In women, careful examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix is important. Careful inspection of the penis should be performed in men. Digital rectal examination and anoscopy should be performed in both sexes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenopathy at other sites &ndash; Lymphadenopathy at sites other than cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal nodes usually represents metastasis from a primary lung cancer. These patients should be evaluated with CT of the chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.</p><p/><p>Immunohistochemical studies and electron microscopy are of little value in identifying the primary site for patients with SCC of unknown primary site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568147757\"><span class=\"h1\">POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 25 percent of all cancers of unknown primary site have poorly differentiated histology. About 80 percent of these can be recognized as poorly differentiated carcinoma by light microscopic examination. The remainder are termed &ldquo;poorly differentiated neoplasm&rdquo; after initial examination, implying that the pathologist is confident of the diagnosis of malignancy but cannot distinguish between a carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, or hematologic malignancy based upon light microscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional pathologic evaluation is essential in all poorly differentiated CUPs. The group of cancers initially termed &ldquo;poorly differentiated neoplasm&rdquo; contains a number of highly treatable entities, including lymphoma and germ cell tumor. The identity of tumors called &ldquo;poorly differentiated carcinoma&rdquo; by light microscopy can also be clarified. This group contains poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas and occasionally non-carcinomas. Additional pathologic studies are almost always successful in identifying the lineage of these tumors; these studies may include immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling, electron microscopy, and chromosome analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosing an occult germ cell tumor is of particular importance in this group because of the responsiveness of germ cell tumors to chemotherapy. In addition to specialized pathologic studies, elevated serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may suggest the diagnosis of extragonadal germ cell tumor of unknown primary site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a primary site is identified or is strongly suggested in a patient with CUP, treatment is based upon the usual treatment for advanced cancer arising from that site. While regional disease is amenable to surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation, systemic therapy should be considered for disseminated disease.</p><p>Accurate diagnostic classification can lead to individualized therapy for specific subgroups of patients with CUP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52585 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with adenocarcinoma and isolated axillary lymphadenopathy, who may benefit from treatment as stage II breast cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Axillary node metastases with occult primary breast cancer&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis, who may respond to treatment patterned after that used for stage III ovarian cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site&quot;, section on 'Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis'</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical features and pathologic studies consistent with a colorectal primary tumor may respond well to treatment for metastatic colon cancer.

For these patients, empiric chemotherapy has been considered the standard treatment. Such treatment, usually with combinations containing a platinum agent plus one of the newer cytotoxic agents (taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>), has produced median survivals of 7 to 10 months, and two-year survival rates of 20 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This treatment represents an improvement when compared with historical results (median survival four to six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]; however, the majority of patients derive only modest benefit. In addition, the improvement of therapy for many advanced solid tumors makes it increasingly unlikely that optimal therapeutic results can be achieved using a single &ldquo;broad-spectrum&rdquo; chemotherapy regimen.</p><p>With improvements in diagnosis, particularly gene expression profiling, a tissue of origin can be accurately predicted in the majority of patients, even though the anatomic primary site cannot be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For patients who do not fit into a specific treatable subset, data are now compelling to support site-specific treatment based on prediction of the site of origin by gene expression profiling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52585 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Benefits of this approach are most evident in patients predicted to have treatment-responsive tumor types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Current recommendations for treatment of patients with CUP are diagrammed in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86664\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86664 \">algorithm 1</a>). Although not yet included in the standard treatment guidelines (eg, National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines), the authors are convinced that gene expression profiling followed by site-specific therapy should now be a part of the standard management of CUP patients who do not fit into a specific subset. Empiric chemotherapy should be considered for patients whose tumors are unclassifiable by gene expression profiling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for up to 4 to 5 percent of all cancer diagnoses.
