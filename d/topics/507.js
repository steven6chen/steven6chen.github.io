FBA in children may be suspected on the basis of a choking episode if such an episode is witnessed by an adult or remembered by the child. In contrast, the clinical presentation of unwitnessed FBA may be subtle, and diagnosis requires careful review of the history, clinical assessment, and the judicious use of radiography and bronchoscopy.</p><p>Aspiration of foreign bodies in children will be reviewed here. A discussion of foreign body aspiration in adults and older children is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FBA is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in children, especially in those younger than two years of age. During 2000, ingestion or aspiration of a foreign body (FB) was responsible for more than 17,000 emergency department visits in children younger than 14 years in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Before the 20th century, aspiration of an FB had a 24 percent mortality rate. With the development of modern bronchoscopy techniques, mortality has fallen dramatically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nonetheless, in the United States, FBA was responsible for about 4,800 deaths in 2013, or about 1 death per 100,000 children 0 to 4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Death caused by suffocation following FBA is the fifth most common cause of unintentional-injury mortality in the United States, and the leading cause of unintentional-injury mortality in children younger than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 to 2011 of all cases with pediatric FBA in the United States, the combined rate of death or anoxic brain injury was around 4 percent, and the annual associated inpatient cost was close to $13 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of pediatric FBA episodes occur in children younger than three years, with the peak incidence between one and two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. At this age, most children are able to stand, are apt to explore their world via the oral route, and have the fine motor skills to put a small object into their mouths, but they do not yet have molars to chew food adequately. Additional predisposing factors to FBA in this age group include access to improper foods or small objects, activity while eating, and older siblings (who may place food or objects into the mouths of infants or toddlers). Young children are also particularly vulnerable to FBA because of the smaller diameter of their airway, which is prone to obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In older children and adults, neurologic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], loss of consciousness, and alcohol or sedative abuse predispose to FBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Most case series in children report a male predominance, with a sex ratio ranging from 1.5:1 to 2.4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Commonly aspirated FBs in children include peanuts (36 to 55 percent of all FBs in Western society), other nuts, seeds (particularly watermelon seeds in Middle Eastern countries), popcorn, food particles, hardware, and pieces of toys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68615%7EPULM%2F81535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68615 graphicRef81535 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/8-10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,12,13</a>]. Food items are the most common items aspirated by infants and toddlers, whereas nonfood items (eg, coins, paper clips, pins, pen caps) are more commonly aspirated by older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Toy balloons or similar objects (eg, inflated gloves or condoms) are the most common objects involved in fatal childhood FBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; balls, marbles, and other toys also are commonly involved. Factors that make FBs more dangerous include roundness (round objects are most likely to cause complete airway obstruction and asphyxiation), failure to break apart easily, compressibility, and smooth, slippery surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The effects of pill aspiration depend on the properties of the medication. Certain medications such as iron or potassium may dissolve in the airways and cause intense inflammation and eventually stenosis, so early diagnosis and timely extraction is important to minimize long-term consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>The majority of aspirated FBs in children are located in the bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,24</a>]. Laryngeal and tracheal FBs are less common. In a large case series of FBA aspirations in children, the sites of the FB were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larynx &ndash; 3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Trachea/carina</span> &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right lung &ndash; 60 percent (52 percent in the main bronchus, 6 percent in the lower lobe bronchus, and &lt;1 percent in the middle lobe bronchus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left lung &ndash; 23 percent (18 percent in the main bronchus and 5 percent in the lower bronchus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral &ndash; 2 percent</p><p/><p>Although most aspirated FBs are located in the bronchi, large, bulky FBs (eg, food), or those with sharp, irregular edges may become lodged in the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]. This is particularly common in infants younger than one year. Tracheal narrowing or weak respiratory effort may predispose to tracheal FB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compared with bronchial FBs, laryngotracheal FBs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of foreign body aspiration (FBA) depends to some extent upon degree of airway blockage, and the location of the object, as well as the age of the child, the type of object aspirated (particularly its size and composition), and the elapsed time since the event (which often depends on whether the event was witnessed). Presentation and diagnosis within 24 hours of aspiration occurs in approximately 50 to 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who present with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and altered mental status have a true medical emergency that demands prompt recognition, life support, and rigid bronchoscopic removal of the foreign body (FB). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening FBA'</a> below.)</p><p>More commonly, children with FBA present with partial airway obstruction. The most common symptom is cough, followed by tachypnea and stridor, often with focal monophonic wheezing or decreased air entry. Regional variation in aeration is an important clue to the diagnosis, and often is detected only if the clinician completes a thorough examination when the child is quiet and with minimal ambient noise. Nonspecific findings of cough and generalized wheezing are often present. The classic triad of wheeze, cough, and diminished breath sounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] is not universally present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>]. In a review of 135 cases of airway FB in children, the classic triad was present in only 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of the triad has high specificity (96 to 98 percent) for the diagnosis of FBA, but the sensitivity is low (27 to 43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The signs and symptoms of FBA vary according to the location of the FB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngotracheal &ndash; Laryngotracheal FBs are uncommon (5 to 17 percent of FBs) but are particularly likely to be life-threatening. Symptoms include stridor, wheeze, and dyspnea, and sometimes hoarseness. FBs in this location are most likely to present with acute respiratory distress, which must be addressed promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Laryngeal FBs or large penetrating FBs with sharp edges also may cause symptoms related to the esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening FBA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large bronchi &ndash; The usual symptoms are coughing and wheezing. Hemoptysis, dyspnea, choking, shortness of breath, respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds, fever, and cyanosis may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,7,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,31</a>]. The right main bronchus is the most common location (45 to 55 percent of FBs), followed by left bronchus (about 30 to 40 percent of FBs), and bilateral bronchi (1 to 5 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower airways &ndash; Children with these FBs may have little acute distress after the initial choking episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68288 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History of choking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A witnessed episode of choking, defined as the sudden onset of cough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyanosis in a previously healthy child, has a sensitivity of 76 to 92 percent for the diagnosis of FBA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64415 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,10,11,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11,32-34</a>]. The choking phase occurs immediately after the episode and lasts a few seconds to several minutes. The acute episode usually is self-limited and may be followed by a symptom-free period, which must not be misinterpreted as a sign of resolution since it may delay the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In other cases, children continue to have respiratory distress, wheezing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent coughing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68288 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Although highly suggestive of FBA, a history of choking may not be recalled during initial evaluation; detailed and repeated questioning of all caregivers may be necessary to stimulate recall of the choking episode. In one review of 200 cases of FBA, 19 percent presented more than one month after aspiration, even though a history of choking was present in 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present days or weeks after the aspiration often develop symptoms due to complications related to the presence of the FB, such as infection and inflammation of the airway. Thus, they may present with fever and other signs and symptoms of pneumonia. In the absence of a history of choking, FBA may not be suspected. These patients with occult FBA may improve with antibiotic therapy. However, the infiltrate on chest radiograph usually does not resolve, and recurrence of pneumonia is common.</p><p>One reason for delay in diagnosis is that children with lower airway FBs may present with subtle or nonspecific symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, they may come to medical attention only when they develop dyspnea, wheezing, chronic cough, or recurrent pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68288\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68288 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other factors contributing to diagnostic delay include unwitnessed aspiration, a decision by the parents or physician not to pursue evaluation once the acute choking episode has resolved, and misinterpretation of symptoms as evidence supporting the diagnosis of de novo pneumonia, asthma or asthma exacerbation, or bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35-37</a>].

In contrast, these interventions should be avoided in children who are able to speak or cough since they may convert a partial to a complete obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the same reason &quot;blind&quot; sweeping of the mouth should be avoided.</p><p>The recommendations of the American Heart Association (AHA) regarding interventions for choking represent the standard in acute life-threatening events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55990\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55990 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. When the obstructing FB is below the larynx and does not move with the AHA recommended procedures, intubation may permit some ventilation until rigid bronchoscopy is possible. The administration of oxygen and other life-sustaining care should be provided until bronchoscopy can be performed.

The caregivers should be specifically asked about a history of a choking episode in the hours or days prior to symptom onset. A history of choking, when specifically sought, is found in approximately 80 to 90 percent of confirmed cases (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History of choking'</a> above). The physical examination should evaluate for wheezing, stridor, and regional variation in breath sounds, which may be subtle and difficult to detect in a young uncooperative child. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456752790\"><span class=\"h3\">Level of suspicion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of the evaluation depends on the clinical suspicion for FBA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105656\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105656 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>moderate or high suspicion</strong> of FBA is suggested by any of the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Witnessed FBA, regardless of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of choking, with any subsequent symptoms or suspicious characteristics on imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Young child with suggestive symptoms <strong>without other explanation</strong>, especially if there are suspicious characteristics on imaging.

On occasion, the adjunctive use of a flexible bronchoscope may be helpful. Normal chest radiographs are not sufficient to rule out FBA, primarily because most FBs are radiolucent. The morbidity and mortality may be increased if bronchoscopic evaluation is delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/10,11,36,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,36,39,40</a>].

In this case, normal results of plain radiographs are sufficient to provisionally exclude FBA.

However, most objects aspirated by children are radiolucent (eg, nuts, food particles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and are not detected with standard radiographs unless aspiration is accompanied by airway obstruction or other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41-43</a>]. As a result, normal findings on radiography do not rule out FBA, and the clinical history is the main determinant of whether to perform a bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>In children with lower airway FBA, the most common radiographic findings in lower airway FBA are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/17,29,30,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29,30,45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperinflated lung (lucency distal to the obstruction) &ndash; This is caused by partial airway obstruction with air trapping, such that air passes with inspiration, but not with exhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76951%7EPULM%2F55279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76951 graphicRef55279 \">image 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atelectasis &ndash; This is usually caused by complete obstruction of an airway, since air is resorbed from the distal alveoli over time.

Ideally, both inspiratory and expiratory radiographs should be obtained, if this is possible, because this may increase the sensitivity for detecting a radiolucent FB.

Even if the FB is radiolucent, these films may suggest the diagnosis if they show a subglottic density or swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32003478\"><span class=\"h4\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is a possible diagnostic option for patients who are asymptomatic or symptomatic but stable, who have normal or inconclusive plain radiographs but an ongoing clinical suspicion of FB aspiration. However, this imaging is only helpful if the provider judges that negative imaging would be sufficient to preclude bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In most cases, such patients proceed directly to bronchoscopy without CT. </p><p>The sensitivity of CT for FBA is almost 100 percent and specificity is 66.7 to 100 percent. Unlike plain radiography, CT usually can detect radiolucent foreign bodies such as vegetables. Ultrafast CT is also a useful tool; compared with standard CT, this technique has the advantages of faster speed of image acquisition, increased anatomic coverage, less need for sedation, ability to generate three-dimensional images of the large airways. The main disadvantage of any CT technique is the exposure to ionizing radiation and delay in proceeding to therapeutic bronchoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32004136\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tracheobronchial tree should be examined in <strong>all</strong> cases with a moderate or high suspicion of FBA, typically using rigid bronchoscopy so that the object can be safely removed. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body removal'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Flexible rather than rigid bronchoscopy may be used for diagnostic purposes in cases in which the diagnosis is unclear, or if the FBA is known but the location of the object is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In this case, most centers also arrange to have rigid bronchoscopy available on stand-by because this is the preferred approach for FB removal. In some centers, flexible bronchoscopy is also used for FB removal, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body removal'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H127539331\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of foreign body aspiration (FBA) has been established by imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flexible bronchoscopy, the object should be removed as quickly as possible. Laryngeal or tracheal foreign bodies (FBs) require particularly urgent management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Foreign body removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If FBA is known to have occurred or is strongly suspected, rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice to identify and remove the object [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/29,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,53,54</a>]. Rigid bronchoscopy permits control of the airway, good visualization, manipulation of the object with a wide variety of forceps, and ready management of mucosal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/21,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,55-57</a>]. Bronchoscopy is successful in removing the FB in about 95 percent of cases, with a complication rate of less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/6,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,58,59</a>]. Thoracotomy is occasionally indicated in the rare cases in which FBs are visualized but cannot be removed through a rigid bronchoscope. </p><p>FB extraction should be performed by an experienced operator to minimize the risk of complications. Unsuccessful attempts to remove the FB may push it into a distal position, making them more difficult to retrieve. In addition, dislodgement of all or part of the FB, or a fragment of the FB, into the mainstem bronchus of the contralateral lung are potentially lethal complications if the originally involved bronchus remains obstructed by inflammation or residual FB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Major complications of FB extraction include pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, but they occur rarely.</p><p>Alternatively, flexible (rather than rigid) bronchoscopy is used to remove the FB in some centers with high levels of experience in this technique. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/30,56,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,56,61,62</a>]. This technique usually is limited to older adolescents or young adults. Potential advantages of using flexible bronchoscopy for FB extraction are avoidance of general anesthesia and the ability to reach subsegmental bronchi. In a large case series, the FB was successfully removed by flexible bronchoscopy in 91 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The main disadvantage of flexible bronchoscopy for FB removal is the risk of dislodging the FB and further compromising the airway. Because of these concerns, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) states, &quot;In general, rigid instruments are superior for detailed anatomic assessment of the larynx and cervical trachea and for operative manipulation, principally foreign body extraction&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Flexible bronchoscopy is also used by most centers for management of FBA in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in adults&quot;, section on 'Foreign body removal'</a>.) </p><p>If there is a suspicion for multiple small FBs or fragments, we recommend performing a complete flexible bronchoscopy after FB removal, to evaluate the entire tracheobronchial tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/33,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,63</a>]. If the FB has been retained long enough for an infection to occur, a Gram stain and culture should be obtained through the bronchoscope to guide postoperative antibiotic management. If clinical symptoms, signs, or abnormal radiographs persist after the FB removal and treatment of infection, repeat bronchoscopic examination is warranted to look for a second, previously unseen FB.</p><p>Occasionally, a FB that has been retained for several weeks will cause such intense airway inflammation and infection that it cannot be removed. In such cases, antibiotics should be administered, guided by gram stain and cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. In addition, a three- to seven-day course of systemic corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> [or equivalent] 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day either by mouth or intravenously) may help reduce inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], although the use of corticosteroids has not been objectively studied in this situation. After appropriate antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, the FB may be removable at a second rigid bronchoscopy. Corticosteroid therapy may result in dislodgement of the FB followed by unwitnessed expectoration and swallowing; therefore, these patients should have a repeat physical examination and radiographic evaluation to determine if the FB is still present before bronchoscopy is repeated. Thoracotomy may be required if the second procedure is unsuccessful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When FBA is diagnosed soon after the event, there is usually little damage to the airway or lung parenchyma. The longer the FB is retained, the more likely are complications (eg, atelectasis, postobstructive pneumonia). A FB that causes chronic or recurrent distal infection may lead to bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/33,46,47,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,46,47,65,66</a>]. This complication should be treated after the FB is removed. Cultures obtained during bronchoscopy guide the initial antibiotic choice in treating infected areas of bronchiectasis. Failure to promptly diagnose the FBA may also cause complications from the use of nonindicated treatments, such as steroids, antibiotics, or bronchodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, primary passive intervention strategies to reduce the risk of foreign body aspiration (FBA; eg, legislation that eliminates choking hazards from the market) are more effective than active intervention strategies (strategies that require constant parental supervision) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;, section on 'Principles of injury prevention and control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Legislation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, legislative efforts to prevent FBA in children were initiated in 1927 with passage of the Federal Caustic Act, which prohibited misbranded shipments of dangerous caustic or corrosive substances in interstate or foreign commerce. This act was the first child-environmental safety act, and its passage was due largely to the efforts of the pioneering laryngologist, Chevalier Jackson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Additional legislative efforts to prevent FBA in children include various portions of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA, 1979). The Consumer Products Safety Act banned from interstate commerce any toy or other article intended for use by children younger than three years old that is potentially hazardous for choking, aspiration, or ingestion because of small parts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. &quot;Small parts&quot; are objects that fit into the Small Parts Test Fixture (SPTF), a cylinder with a diameter of 3.17 cm and a depth between 2.54 and 5.71 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Similar standards are included in the European Toy Safety Directive of 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>], and the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act of 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Use of the SPTF has not been universally successful in preventing choking deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/18,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,75,76</a>]. In a review of the characteristics of FBs involved in choking episodes, objects that were spherical or had spherical parts caused asphyxiation even when they met SPTF standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Based upon the sizes and shapes of the FBs in this study, the authors suggest that spherical objects should be at least 4.44 cm in diameter, and linear objects should be at least 7.62 cm in length to prevent fatal choking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Since 1995, packaging for toys with small parts, balls with diameters &lt;4.44 cm, and marbles must contain the label stating that the item contains small parts, is a choking hazard, and should not be used by children younger than three years. In addition, packages of balloons must contain a label stating that balloons are a choking hazard, that children younger than eight years can choke or suffocate on uninflated or broken balloons, and that adult supervision is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] amended the FHSA to require choking-hazard warnings to be displayed on or adjacent to product advertisements on web sites, catalogs, or other printed materials that provide direct means for purchase of a product for which a warning is required under the FHSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Of note, food items, which are the most commonly aspirated foreign body (FB) in infants and toddlers, are not regulated by the FHSA, and are not subject to SPTF testing. Actions by the federal government to prevent choking on food by young children should include surveillance, cautionary food labeling, recalls when necessary, and public education.

Although educational efforts may change safety-related knowledge and behavior, direct evidence that educational counseling results in lower injury rates is lacking. Nonetheless, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that anticipatory guidance to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">choking/FBA</span> be provided to caregivers beginning when the child is six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-foreign-bodies-in-children/abstract/14,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,79</a>]. At this age, children begin to develop the fine motor dexterity to pick up small objects and put them into their mouths.

The risk is highest in children between one and three years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of choking is highly suggestive of FBA, even if it occurred days or weeks before presentation. The episode may be immediately followed by respiratory symptoms, or there may be a symptom-free period, which must not be misinterpreted as a sign of resolution since it may delay the diagnosis. The absence of choking history does <strong>not</strong> rule out FBA, since choking events may be unwitnessed or unrecalled. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History of choking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of asphyxia indicates the need for immediate resuscitation and examination of the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55990\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55990 \">algorithm 2</a>).

Ideally, both inspiratory and expiratory radiographs should be obtained, if this is possible, because this may increase the sensitivity for detecting a radiolucent foreign body (FB). Subsequent steps depend on the degree of clinical suspicion for FBA, and may include computed tomography (CT) or bronchoscopy. Normal radiographic studies do not exclude the presence of an aspirated FB. (See <a href=\"#H32002736\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A moderate or high suspicion of FBA is appropriate for all children with a witnessed FBA (regardless of symptoms), as well as for young children with suspicious respiratory symptoms or characteristics on imaging, especially if there is a history of choking. Suspicious symptoms include cyanotic spells, dyspnea, stridor, sudden onset of cough or wheezing (often focal and monophonic), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unilaterally diminished breath sounds.

In this case, normal results of plain radiographs are sufficient to exclude radiopaque FBA, and lessen (but not completely eliminate) the concern for a radiolucent FBA.

Flexible rather than rigid bronchoscopy may be used for diagnostic purposes in cases in which the diagnosis is unclear, or if the FBA is known but the location of the object is unclear.
