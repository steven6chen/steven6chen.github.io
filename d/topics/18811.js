In a trial comparing unmasked CGM versus SMBG in patients with type 1 diabetes and a history of impaired hypoglycemic awareness or severe hypoglycemia during the previous year, there was a reduction in the mean number of hypoglycemic events per 28 days and in the number of nocturnal hypoglycemic events in the CGM but not the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The disparity in diabetes incidence may be related in part to differences in modifiable risk factors. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort study comparing diabetes incidence in over 4000 black or white young adults, the racial disparity in diabetes risk was primarily associated with biologic risk factors (eg, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure) as well as with neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors during young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, subsequent trials have not shown a benefit, including a recent trial specifically designed to evaluate the role of oral insulin in preventing or delaying the onset of type 1 diabetes in high risk individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Participants were similar to those in the subgroup of the Diabetes Prevention Trial who had experienced apparent benefit. Over 500 insulin autoantibody-positive first or second degree relatives (median age 8.2 years) of patients with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to oral insulin or placebo. After a median follow-up of 2.7 years, oral insulin did not prevent or delay the development of type 1 diabetes.

In a 26-week trial comparing once-daily oral semaglutide (at several doses) with oral placebo or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in over 600 patients with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) was greater with oral and subcutaneous semaglutide than with placebo and was similar with oral (at the two highest doses) and subcutaneous semaglutide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Short-term adverse effects of oral and subcutaneous semaglutide were also similar.

Thus, UpToDate continues to recommend that angiotensin inhibition and statin therapy not be used for primary prevention of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes.

In a recent trial evaluating CGM or usual care (self-monitoring of blood glucose at least four times daily) in 158 adults with type 2 diabetes receiving multiple daily injections of insulin, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) at 24 weeks was greater with CGM (0.8 versus 0.5 percentage points, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In two parallel open-label trials, 325 women (215 pregnant, 110 planning pregnancy) with type 1 diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy were randomly assigned to either CGM plus capillary glucose monitoring or capillary glucose monitoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-endocrinology-and-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In women planning pregnancy, glycemic control at the end of the trial was similar in both groups. In pregnant women, glycemic control and some newborn outcomes (eg, frequency of hypoglycemia, large for gestational age) were better in the CGM group. Although the improvement in neonatal hypoglycemia with CGM appears promising, the lack of blinding may have biased decisions regarding neonatal management. Also, it is unclear whether the high level of maternal compliance with CGM in this trial could be achieved in other populations.

After 24 weeks, the proportion of patients who achieved a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) &lt;7 percent and no severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis was greater in the sotagliflozin group (28.6 versus 15.2 percent). However, the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was higher in the sotagliflozin group (3 versus 0.6 percent) as was the frequency of dehydration and genital infections. Whether the increased risk for treatment-related complications is balanced by the modest lowering of A1C is unclear.

By classifying diabetes preoperatively as mild, moderate, or severe by a nomogram based on four variables, the authors found that RYGB resulted in a higher rate of diabetes remission than SG for patients with moderate diabetes and a similar rate as SG for those with mild diabetes. For patients with severe diabetes, both procedures had low rates of diabetes remission. We believe the choice between RYGB and SG should be based on clinical factors in addition to glucose control, such as the patient's overall surgical risk and whether the patient has severe acid reflux, Crohn disease, or requires organ transplantation.
