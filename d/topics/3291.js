Since 1997, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, or Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), has been in force. The CWC is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), in The Hague, Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Despite international prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons, large amounts of various agents remain available in national stockpiles in several countries, and their use against military and civilian populations has been documented as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a nerve agent (sarin [GB]) against civilians and rebel troops in Ghouta and Khan Shaykhun Syria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of nerve and sulfur mustard [H] agents by Iraq against military targets in Iran and Kurdish villages (eg, Halabjah) in northern Iraq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of sarin (GB) and VX by members of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvised explosive devices rigged to release chlorine gas by Iraqi insurgents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of chlorine in barrel bombs in Syria and Iraq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thwarted attempts by various terrorist groups to use chemical agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] </p><p/><p>In addition, many chemicals that are commonly used for industrial or commercial purposes are not prohibited by the CWC and have the potential for causing mass casualties. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326909\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMICAL AGENT DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical agents capable of causing mass casualties are described by several categories as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traditional chemical weapons</strong> &ndash; Traditional chemical weapons refer to known agents that have been stockpiled by nations for use during war and will be the focus of this topic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has assigned a one- to three-character designation (often called a NATO code) to each of the traditional agents; for agents such as VX (O-ethyl S-[2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl] methylphosphonothioate) and BZ (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate), this code may be more widely used than the chemical name of the compound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Categories of chemical weapons include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary agents (eg, chlorine or phosgene [GG]) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Blood&rdquo; agents (eg, cyanide compounds [AC]) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vesicants (blister agents such as sulfur mustard [H] compounds) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nerve agents (eg, tabun [GA], sarin [GB], soman [GD], and VX) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incapacitating agents (eg, the anticholinergic agent, BZ [3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, or QNB]) </p><p/><p>Some compounds, such as chlorine, phosgene, and cyanide, have been used in war and are also used in industry; these are sometimes termed <strong>dual-use </strong>chemicals.</p><p>Although arsenicals (eg, arsine, ethyldichloroarsine [ED], methyldichloroarsine [MD] and phenyldichloroarsine [PD]) have characteristics that would make them attractive as a chemical weapon, they are primarily of historic interest and have not been stockpiled to any great degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Riot-control agents </strong>&ndash; The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) also regards riot-control agents, for example OC (ie, oleoresin capsicum) and CS (o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile), as weaponized chemical agents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Binary chemical weapons </strong>&ndash; Binary chemical weapons are not separate compounds; instead the term refers to the practice of developing munitions that hold two immediate precursors to a chemical agent in separate compartments divided by a membrane that ruptures when the round is launched. The precursors mix in flight and generate the desired chemical agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The CWC&nbsp;prohibits several important precursors to chemical agents,&nbsp;but given their availability, synthesis of even complex nerve agents is not beyond the reach of those with graduate-level training in chemistry, as the Aum Shinrikyo cult demonstrated with their nerve agent attacks in the Tokyo subway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].&nbsp;The simpler chemical agents can be synthesized even more easily or, in the case of dual-use agents, simply purchased or stolen.&nbsp;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic industrial chemicals </strong>&ndash; Toxic industrial chemicals, or TICs, include a variety of industrial chemicals that have the potential for causing mass casualties including hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and sulfuric acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, serious chemical exposure does not require an industrial source. For example, &ldquo;detergent suicides,&rdquo; the intentional mixing of common household products to produce toxic compounds such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide, demonstrate how easily toxic chemicals can be made using commercially available substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, local resources to identify TICs or dangerous commercial chemicals primarily reside in fire departments. Decontamination procedures and medical management of TIC or dangerous commercial chemical exposure vary according to agent. Resources to assist the clinician are available online. (See <a href=\"#H42\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-traditional agents</strong> &ndash; This term refers to newer chemical agents that have been synthesized and weaponized outside the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The details of some of these agents remain classified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mid-spectrum agents</strong> &ndash; Mid-spectrum agents are chemical poisons produced by biological organisms&nbsp;(eg, ricin, T-2 mycotoxins, and botulinum toxin) and are also considered chemical agents by the CWC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. These agents are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H11645282\" class=\"local\">'Antidotes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Impending airway compromise or respiratory distress also requires triage as immediate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, any person with suspicious liquid on the skin must also be considered immediate until prompt (local, spot) decontamination has occurred and the patient is reassessed. (See <a href=\"#H5890503\" class=\"local\">'Local or spot decontamination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed</strong> &ndash; Delayed casualties can wait up to several hours for medical care although if they need rapid local decontamination and prompt field decontamination, they are immediate until local decontamination has been occurred. These patients can obey commands, are not in respiratory distress, have peripheral pulses and no major hemorrhage <strong>but</strong> do have injuries that are more than minor. Typically, these patients cannot walk without assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to these criteria, patients with exposure to peripherally acting pulmonary agents, vesicants, BZ, and riot-control agents are typically classified as delayed with respect to medical treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minimal </strong>&ndash; Patients who meet all criteria for delayed care AND have only minor injuries are considered minimal once appropriately decontaminated. These patients are typically able to walk and talk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For example, patients who have been exposed to nerve agent vapor but then removed from exposure and whose symptoms are now resolving are considered minimal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Expectant/dead</span> </strong>&ndash; Expectant patients are those who are <strong>not</strong> likely to survive given available resources. At the scene of a mass casualty chemical exposure, patients who are not breathing after control of major hemorrhage, opening of the airway, chest decompression, administration of autoinjector antidotes, and, in children, provision of two rescue breaths are classified as dead. Furthermore, patients who have experienced a respiratory or cardiac arrest or continued seizures despite antidote therapy warrant withholding of medical resources if minimal or scant resources are available and there are large numbers of casualties requiring care and transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemical-terrorism-rapid-recognition-and-initial-medical-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p/><p>Additional considerations for triage of patients with chemical agent exposure include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Casualties whose only exposure is to vapor assume a lower priority for thorough patient decontamination than those exposed to liquid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the chemical agent has a long latent period, the sorting of patients for evacuation may be different than for medical treatment. As an example, a patient who develops shortness of breath after only four hours of exposure to phosgene may be delayed for medical&nbsp;stabilization&nbsp;but urgent for transport to a pulmonary intensive care unit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory symptoms occurring less than four hours after exposure to a peripherally acting pulmonary agent or to a vesicant imply a high dose and a guarded prognosis.

A dilute bleach solution (0.5 percent hypochlorite, made by mixing one part standard household bleach with nine parts water) may also be used followed by rinsing with plain water. The use of straight bleach (5 percent hypochlorite or greater) is to be discouraged because of potential damage to the skin that may cause increased absorption of the chemical agent.
