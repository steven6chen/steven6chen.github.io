It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent B lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), one of the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the blood, whereas the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal. While there is some difference to the treatment of early stage CLL and SLL, the treatment of advanced stage disease is the same. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The selection of initial therapy for advanced stage or symptomatic disease will be reviewed here.

Experts in the field use different treatment approaches. As such, there are several initial treatment options for patients with symptomatic CLL or advanced SLL. These include the following options, administered as single agents or as combinations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purine analogs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Bruton&rsquo;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a></p><p/><p>Furthermore, a number of novel agents (eg, inhibitors of PI3-kinase and BCL2) are in trials for primary treatment of CLL. The optimal therapy for each of the subpopulations of CLL patients (eg, young, older adult, or patients with high-risk features) is not currently known and is the subject of multiple ongoing cooperative studies. The best treatment for an individual patient is enrollment in a well-conducted clinical trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Investigational therapies'</a>.)</p><p>The estimated median overall survival with modern regimens is approximately three to eight years, depending on disease features, patient characteristics, and, therefore, treatment choice. While overall survival rates differ only modestly, these regimens differ significantly in their rates of complete remission (CR), time to progression, and associated toxicities. For patients who do not wish to participate in a clinical trial, our choice among these therapies is made based upon patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and goals of therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most younger (eg, &lt;70 years) patients, we prefer the use of a regimen that contains both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. Specifically, we use combination therapy with either fludarabine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and rituximab (FCR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86797 \">table 1</a>) or fludarabine plus rituximab (FR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86798 \">table 2</a>). As described in more detail below, studies suggest that regimens that include these agents improve survival in this patient population. Ongoing trials are evaluating the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> in this population; however, initial results suggest that ibrutinib results in a lower percentage of patients achieving a complete remission than that seen with FCR. (See <a href=\"#H23868573\" class=\"local\">'Choice of fludarabine regimen'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most older adults (eg, &gt;70 years) with CLL, we prefer initial treatment with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>. Combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a> is an alternative and may be preferred in patients with comorbidities (eg, history of atrial fibrillation, moderate hepatic impairment, history of severe bleeding) or concomitant medications (eg, anticoagulants) that make them poor candidates for ibrutinib. Fludarabine-based therapy is not commonly used in this population, because older patients who have a compromised performance status may have a higher incidence of side effects, particularly opportunistic infections with fludarabine-based therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fludarabine</a> may also lead to prolonged myelosuppression in this age group. (See <a href=\"#H5624031\" class=\"local\">'Older patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (BR) has efficacy and tolerability intermediate to fludarabine- and chlorambucil-based treatments, and is an acceptable alternative to FR or FCR among patients with decreased renal function or other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H23868301\" class=\"local\">'Bendamustine-based therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with del(17p) are at high risk of either not responding to initial treatment with chemoimmunotherapy, or relapsing soon after achieving remission, and should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. For this population, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> regardless of patient age. <span class=\"nowrap\">Younger/fit</span> patients with an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor are considered for non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H5624038\" class=\"local\">'High-risk disease: del(17p) or TP53 mutations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Importantly, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>) carry a risk of hepatitis B reactivation among patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All patients should be screened for hepatitis B prior to starting treatment. Patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection should be monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of reactivation during therapy and for several months after completion of therapy. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies should be discontinued in patients with hepatitis reactivation. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most studies have utilized intravenous administration. A subcutaneous formulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-hyaluronidase-subcutaneous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab-hyaluronidase</a>) that uses a fixed dose and a shorter administration time is available for patients who have tolerated intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Long-term toxicity with fludarabine-based regimens appears to be limited to myelotoxicity and infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Several prospective, randomized trials comparing single agent purine analogs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>) to alkylating agents (eg, chlorambucil) demonstrated improved response rates and progression-free survival for patients treated with purine analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While initial reports demonstrated similar survival rates, long-term follow-up of a randomized phase III trial comparing fludarabine, chlorambucil, or a combination of the two in 509 previously untreated patients with CLL demonstrated that, when compared with chlorambucil alone, single agent fludarabine results in significantly higher overall survival rates at six years (43 versus 38 percent) and at eight years (31 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A separate analysis of 663 patients enrolled onto successive trials of initial therapy in CLL confirmed a survival benefit for fludarabine compared with chlorambucil among patients younger than 70 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), but not in those over 70 years (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>These data from long-term analyses show that the drug chosen for the initial treatment can be important and may manifest its survival benefit over another drug only several years later.

The presence of comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, must be considered in addition to age.

CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease and not all patients require treatment at the time of diagnosis. Therapy is indicated for patients with advanced stage disease, high tumor burden, severe disease-related &quot;B&quot; symptoms, or repeated infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96185 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the initiation of active therapy for patients with symptomatic disease, patients with CLL should undergo a pre-treatment evaluation to determine the extent of disease, patient performance status, assessment of comorbidities, and laboratory parameters (eg, del(17)p) that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H5625565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no agreed upon single standard front-line treatment regimen for symptomatic CLL or advanced SLL. There are several initial treatment options for patients with symptomatic CLL or advanced SLL. While overall survival rates with the different available regimens are similar, they differ in their rates of complete remission (CR), time to progression, and associated toxicities. A choice between these therapies is made based upon patient characteristics and goals of therapy. Median overall survival with each of these regimens is approximately three to eight years depending on disease features, patient characteristics, and, therefore, treatment choice. (See <a href=\"#H5622415\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with CLL, treatment regimens and outcomes may differ between younger and older adults, mostly due to the accumulation of comorbidities with age. In most studies, the term &quot;older adults&quot; has been defined as over age 65 or 70. Instead of using an arbitrary age cutoff to define &quot;older&quot; and &quot;younger,&quot; physicians should use clinical judgment to assess the physiologic age of the patient and likelihood that the patient will be able to tolerate more or less intensive treatment regimens. (See <a href=\"#H2551203\" class=\"local\">'Defining &quot;older adult&quot;'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most younger patients, we suggest the use of fludarabine-based therapies rather than more recently approved agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Specifically, we use combination therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (FR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86798 \">table 2</a>) or fludarabine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and rituximab (FCR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86797 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5622422\" class=\"local\">'Fludarabine-based therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FR results in overall response and CR rates of approximately 90 and 47 percent, respectively. The administration of FR to patients with CLL can be complicated by infusion-related reactions and tumor lysis syndrome. Several variations on dose and schedule have been used. (See <a href=\"#H23868398\" class=\"local\">'Fludarabine plus rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>FCR results in overall response and CR rates of approximately 90 to 95 and 40 to 70 percent, respectively. CR achieved with FCR appears to be &quot;deeper&quot; with frequent cases demonstrating no detectable disease on flow cytometry. The FCR regimen has been administered in different variations. (See <a href=\"#H5622436\" class=\"local\">'Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (BR) has efficacy and tolerability intermediate to fludarabine- and chlorambucil-based treatments, and is an acceptable alternative to FR or FCR among patients with decreased renal function or other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H23868301\" class=\"local\">'Bendamustine-based therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While most patients with symptomatic or advanced stage CLL are treated similarly, older patients (eg, &gt;65 years) and patients with del(17p) require particular consideration:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For older adults with symptomatic CLL, we suggest single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> as initial treatment, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> plus a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Chlorambucil plus a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is an alternative and is preferred in patients with comorbidities (eg, moderate hepatic impairment) or concomitant medications (eg, anticoagulants) that make them poor candidates for ibrutinib. (See <a href=\"#H5624031\" class=\"local\">'Older patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2551203\" class=\"local\">'Defining &quot;older adult&quot;'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with del(17p) are at high risk of either not responding to initial treatment, or relapsing soon after achieving remission, and should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. For this population, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> regardless of patient age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). After attaining a first response with any therapy, younger patients should be evaluated for a potential allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
