It is most common in older women but can happen in men and women of all ages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9096668\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes rectal prolapse in adults?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have had more than one baby delivered through the vagina are more likely to get rectal prolapse. Other health conditions that can make rectal prolapse more likely include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term bowel problems such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constipation &ndash; This means your bowel movements are too hard or small, difficult to get out, and happen fewer than 3 times per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Straining during bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; This means your bowel movements are watery or runny and happen more than 3 times a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems in the pelvic area, including weak muscles or a history of pelvic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9096683\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of rectal prolapse in adults?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is bright red tissue sticking out of the anus. The tissue might have mucus or blood on it. Rectal prolapse is not usually painful but can be uncomfortable. The tissue might stay outside the anus or move back inside the body.</p><p>Other symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble starting a bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you have not fully emptied your bowels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking solid or liquid bowel movements (called &quot;fecal incontinence&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9096698\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for rectal prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have the problem by doing an exam. If the tissue has moved back inside your body, your doctor might ask you to squat or sit on the toilet to check if the tissue comes back out of your body.</p><p>You might need other tests. These tests can also show if you have a different problem. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI &ndash; This test creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystocolpoproctography &ndash; For this test, a doctor fills your bladder, vagina, and rectum with a substance called &quot;contrast material&quot; that shows up on X-rays. The X-rays show how these parts of your body are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defecography &ndash; This test also uses contrast material in the rectum and takes X-rays while you have a bowel movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manometry &ndash; This test measures the pressure inside the rectum. It can show if the muscles that control bowel movements are working correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9096713\"><span class=\"h1\">How is rectal prolapse treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on how serious your symptoms are and if you have other health problems. Whatever treatment you have, your doctor will likely tell you to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods that have a lot of fiber. Good choices are fruits, vegetables, prune juice, and cereal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>). You should eat between 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink 4 to 8 cups of water or other fluids per day.</p><p/><p>Other treatment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laxatives &ndash; These are medicines that help make bowel movements easier to get out. Some are pills that you swallow. Others go into the rectum and are called &quot;suppositories.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enemas &ndash; For this treatment, a doctor or nurse squirts fluid into your rectum to help empty your bowels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic floor exercises with biofeedback &ndash; These exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine and bowel movements. They are called &quot;Kegel&quot; exercises. Biofeedback uses devices called sensors that measure muscle activity. They can tell you if you are using the muscles the right way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors use different kinds of surgery to fix rectal prolapse. The surgery is usually done through the belly. But in some cases, it is done through the area between the genitals and the anus, called the &quot;perineum.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9096728\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fecal incontinence (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fecal incontinence (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
