As in adults, acquired hypothyroidism can be caused by both thyroid disease (primary hypothyroidism) and hypothalamic-pituitary disease (central hypothyroidism); furthermore, primary hypothyroidism may be either subclinical (high serum thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] and normal serum free thyroxine [T4] concentrations) or overt (high serum TSH and low serum free T4 concentrations). Whatever its cause, hypothyroidism in children can have deleterious effects on growth, pubertal development and school performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common manifestation of hypothyroidism in children is declining height velocity, often resulting in short stature. The growth delay tends to be insidious in onset, and it may be present for several years before other symptoms occur, if they occur at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, any child with declining height velocity should be evaluated for hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another common feature is altered school performance. Performance often declines, but it improves in some children, perhaps because they are less active and, therefore, less easily distracted and better able to concentrate. One reason for delay in diagnosis is that parents see the latter changes as positive.</p><p>Other common symptoms are sluggishness, lethargy, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, brittle hair, facial puffiness, and muscle aches and pains. If the cause is hypothalamic or pituitary disease, the child may have headaches, visual symptoms, or manifestations of other pituitary hormone deficiencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common physical finding at presentation is a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland (goiter). In one series from Israel, a noticeable goiter was present in 39.5 percent of children with autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Alternatively, the thyroid gland may be normal in size or not palpable at all. Abnormalities on physical examination include short stature, apparent overweight (more fluid retention than obesity), puffy facies with a dull, placid expression, bradycardia, pseudohypertrophy of the muscles, and delayed deep tendon reflexes. Rarely, children may present with a myopathy and dramatically elevated serum creatine kinase levels, known as Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Pubertal development is delayed in most adolescent hypothyroid children. However, some children have sexual precocity, characterized by breast development and vaginal bleeding in girls and macro-orchidism (enlarged testes) in boys, and slightly increased (for age) serum gonadotropin concentrations. A few patients have hyperprolactinemia and rarely galactorrhea. Growth hormone secretion may be normal or decreased, and serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels are usually decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Primary hypothyroidism may be associated with enlargement of the sella turcica, resulting from secondary hyperplasia of thyrotroph cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The enlargement may be discovered when cranial imaging is performed for evaluation of short stature. Although pituitary enlargement may be rather pronounced, with the upper convexity of the gland even abutting inferiorly on the optic chiasm, it rarely causes symptoms or signs (in contrast to a pituitary tumor or craniopharyngioma), and it is reversible with T4 therapy. Thus, primary hypothyroidism must be excluded in any child with an enlarged sella turcica.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of hypothyroidism in children are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55456 \">table 1</a>). They are similar to those in adults, but iatrogenic hypothyroidism is relatively less common. Most can be identified from the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto&rsquo;s) thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of hypothyroidism in children is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, resulting in either thyroid atrophy or goiter. It is more common in girls than boys and in whites than blacks. Among all children with this disorder, euthyroid goiter is more common than hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. The changes in the thyroid gland may not be detectable on physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired goiter in children&quot;, section on 'Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p>In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988 to 1994, 6.3 percent of adolescents (12 to 19 years of age) had positive anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Ab) and 4.8 percent had positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The likelihood of detecting Tg Ab and TPO Ab was two times greater in female versus male adolescents. The incidence of antithyroid antibodies was highest in Hispanic-American adolescents and lowest in black non-Hispanic adolescents; non-Hispanic whites had an incidence between these two groups. Approximately 2 percent of surveyed adolescents had a serum TSH &gt;4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> a value indicating hypothyroidism. While uncommon, hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The natural history of euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis was illustrated in a report of 160 children (mean age 9.1 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among 105 children with elevated thyroid antibodies and normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) followed for five years, 65 percent remained euthyroid, 10 percent developed mild elevation in serum TSH concentrations (typically 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> and 26 percent developed serum TSH levels twofold above the upper limit of normal (usually &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. In a subsequent study of 87 children with elevated thyroid antibodies and mild TSH elevation (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> followed for three years, 41 percent reverted to euthyroidism (TSH &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> 20 percent had persistent mild TSH elevation (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> while 39 percent developed more overt hypothyroidism (TSH &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different mechanisms can be responsible for thyroid atrophy or goiter formation in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

These include Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Turner syndrome, type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, and possibly Klinefelter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down syndrome &mdash; In one report of children with Down syndrome, 28 percent had positive serum thyroid antibody concentrations (mostly TPO Ab), 14 percent had subclinical hypothyroidism, 7 percent overt hypothyroidism, and 5 percent hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another cross-sectional study of 70 children, 24 percent were hypothyroid; the percentage increased with age in those with positive serum antithyroid antibody concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a longitudinal series, the cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism up to age 25 years was 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because of the high rate of congenital hypothyroidism, a randomized trial was performed to determine the effects of universal treatment of all Down syndrome neonates with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>. Treatment reduced delays in motor development and possibly mental development and was associated with greater gains in length and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Until these results are confirmed in other randomized clinical trials, however, routine treatment of all Down syndrome neonates should NOT be considered standard of care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turner syndrome &mdash; In a study of girls with Turner syndrome, 41 percent had high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations (again predominantly TPO Ab), 18 percent had a goiter, and 8 percent had subclinical or overt hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another series of 75 girls and women with Turner syndrome, the frequency of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis increased from 15 percent in the first decade of life to 30 percent in the third decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A study from Sweden confirmed that hypothyroidism becomes more common over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. At the beginning of the study, 23 of 91 adult women (mean age 37.7 &plusmn; 11 years) with Turner syndrome had hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. At the end of a five-year follow-up, an additional 11 had developed hypothyroidism, resulting in an annual incidence of 3.2 percent. In one study, there was a higher prevalence of autoimmune hypothyroidism in those with an isochromosome X karyotype as compared with those with a 45 XO karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Klinefelter syndrome &ndash; There is limited information on the risk of thyroid disease; one study reported hypothyroidism in one of eight boys with Klinefelter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, another study found a general shift toward lower values in serum free T4 concentrations but no compensatory increase in serum TSH, changes more consistent with central hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 diabetes mellitus &mdash; Similar findings have been noted among children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Approximately 20 percent have high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations, and 5 percent have abnormalities in thyroid function, usually subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease &ndash; In a study of 135 children with celiac disease, 31 (23 percent) had positive antithyroid antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. During long-term follow up, 26 percent of the patients with positive antibodies developed subclinical hypothyroidism, while 74 percent remained euthyroid. Another study examined the development of celiac disease in 302 children with autoimmune thyroid disease, in whom 4.6 percent had positive tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and half of whom had confirmed celiac disease on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Excluding children with Down syndrome and type 1 diabetes mellitus, the incidence of celiac disease fell to 1.3 percent, similar to the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H477984966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thus, children with Down, Turner, or Klinefelter syndrome, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or celiac disease should be screened annually for hypothyroidism by measuring serum TSH. Thyroid screening starts when the syndrome or disease is diagnosed. In the case of Down syndrome this is typically in infancy. Children discovered to have autoimmune thyroiditis by screening present at an earlier stage of the disease, and so have fewer clinical symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome &mdash; A few children with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have or later develop other autoimmune endocrinopathies, and, therefore, have an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis occurs in about 10 percent of children with type I autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APECED or Whitaker syndrome); the more common manifestations of this syndrome are hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and mucocutaneous candidiasis. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis also occurs in about 70 percent of children with type II autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (Schmidt syndrome), which has as its other major manifestations adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune diabetes. In one study, autoimmune gastritis with antibodies to gastric parietal cells was found in 30 percent of children with autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune adrenalitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPEX syndrome &mdash; Autoimmune thyroiditis may present in infancy as part of the rare x-linked disorder characterized by autoimmune endocrinopathy, enteropathy, and eczema.

Adolescents with these changes tend to have other findings associated with the &quot;metabolic syndrome,&quot; including higher serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and hepatic enzyme changes seen with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Elevated serum leptin, present in children with obesity, stimulates increased transcription of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and so may be the primary factor increasing serum TSH levels. Thus, the elevated TSH levels probably are a consequence rather than a cause of obesity. The elevated TSH levels return to normal after weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Therefore, obese children with a mild TSH elevation should be managed by lifestyle changes rather than T4 treatment. Further, in normal statured, <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> children who lack objective features of hypothyroidism, such as a slowing height velocity or a goiter, screening thyroid function tests are not indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial and pleural effusions may occur in children with severe hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These effusions resolve with thyroid hormone treatment. Hypothyroidism should be considered in any child with unexplained pericardial or pleural effusions.</p><p>Rarely, an encephalopathy may occur in children or adults with autoimmune thyroiditis. This disorder has been termed Hashimoto encephalopathy, and is thought to be immune-mediated but unrelated to thyroid dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Other causes include Langerhans cell histiocytosis and other infiltrative disorders, other brain tumors, trauma, and radiotherapy (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Craniospinal irradiation'</a> above).

The study noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] suggests that central hypothyroidism in children is characterized by a low ratio of the TSH values taken at 8 AM and 4 PM (8AM:4PM ratio &lt;1.3 in central hypothyroidism; normal 8AM:4PM ratio &gt;1.5), when serum free T4 is in the lower third of the normal range.
