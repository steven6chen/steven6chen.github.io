They work by teaching the body how to fight the germs that cause infections. Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nose sprays or medicines that people swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995802\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting vaccinated can help keep you from getting sick with certain infections. Plus, being vaccinated helps protect the people around you from getting sick. Vaccines are important because many of the infections they protect against can be deadly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995809\"><span class=\"h1\">Which vaccines should adults get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you which vaccines you should get.</p><p>There are some vaccines that all adults should get, even if they got their childhood vaccines. These vaccines protect against the following infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza (flu) &ndash; The flu can cause fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, and sore throat. It can even cause a lung infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pertussis &ndash; This infection is also known as &quot;whooping cough&quot; and can cause a severe breathing illness in babies. It can also make older children and adults sick. Vaccinating adults helps prevent babies around them from getting the infection. The pertussis vaccine comes in the same shot as the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheria and tetanus &ndash; Vaccines against these 2 diseases are usually together in 1 shot, or in a shot with the pertussis vaccine. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. </p><p/><p>Some adults will need other vaccines, depending on their age, medical conditions, jobs, travel plans, and other factors. These can include vaccines to protect against:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcus &ndash; Pneumococcus is a germ that can cause an infection of the lungs, ears, blood, or tissues around the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcus &ndash; Meningococcus is a germ that can cause an infection of the blood or tissues around the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herpes zoster, also called &quot;shingles&quot; &ndash; Shingles can cause a painful skin rash and blisters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) &ndash; HPV infection can lead to cancer of the cervix (in women). It can also cause genital warts in men and women. Young adults, especially women, should get this vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other infections, such as measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, and hepatitis A.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995816\"><span class=\"h1\">How many vaccine doses do I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each vaccine is different. Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. Others need 2 or more doses to prevent an infection.</p><p>Some vaccines prevent an infection for the rest of your life. Others do not. A &quot;booster&quot; is a vaccine dose that you get after a certain number of years. It reminds the body how to prevent an infection. People who got childhood vaccines sometimes need booster doses in adulthood. People who travel to other countries also sometimes need booster doses of certain vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995823\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I be vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different vaccines are given at different ages. Your doctor or nurse will recommend a vaccine schedule that is right for you. Most vaccines take a couple of weeks to work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995830\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can vaccines cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, vaccines cause no side effects. When they do cause side effects, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, mild swelling, or soreness where the shot was given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p/><p>Vaccines also sometimes cause more serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare.</p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse what side effects to expect each time you get a vaccine. If you have a reaction or a problem after a vaccine, let him or her know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995837\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People sometimes worry about this. That's because some forms of the flu vaccine contain small amounts of egg. But the amount is so small that it does not cause an allergic reaction. If you have an egg allergy, you should still get the flu vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995844\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant or want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant or want to get pregnant, let your doctor or nurse know. Certain vaccines should not be given to women who are pregnant or who will be pregnant soon. Other vaccines are important to give during pregnancy to help protect the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29995851\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tdap-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tdap vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-with-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults with HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
