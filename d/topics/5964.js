Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in adults is reviewed separately, as is videolaryngoscopy in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H18429782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscope'</a>.)</p><p>Basic airway maintenance techniques for children and adults that assess the need for airway support, rapid sequence intubation, and the difficult pediatric airway are also discussed separately.

The need for intubation may be immediately apparent, such as in cardiopulmonary arrest. In other circumstances, the decision to intubate may result from dynamic assessment based on progressive or anticipated deterioration despite maximal medical therapies and non-invasive respiratory support.</p><p>Emergency intubation is inherently more difficult to perform than planned intubation in the operating room. Patients are not prescreened and often had recent oral intake as opposed to being in the fasted state (ie, nil per os [NPO]). In addition, rapid clinical deterioration may compromise preparation time, and underlying illness or injury may make patients more susceptible to the adverse physiologic effects of this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous disease processes and clinical situations that may necessitate intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress in children: Emergency evaluation and initial stabilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the emergency department setting, the number of intubations performed on trauma and nontrauma patients is approximately equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Specific indications for intubation fall into four different categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate oxygenation or ventilation</strong> &ndash; Patients who are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation require intubation. Respiratory failure may result from primary pulmonary disease, or from other processes associated with respiratory compromise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61637 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-in-children-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-stabilization#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress in children: Emergency evaluation and initial stabilization&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical evidence of respiratory failure includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor or absent respiratory effort</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor color</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obtunded mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Supporting data, such as noninvasive monitoring of oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), or partial pressure of oxygen or carbon dioxide from blood gas analysis can be helpful; however, endotracheal intubation should not be delayed in patients with clinical evidence of respiratory failure in order to obtain such measurements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inability to maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protect the airway</strong> &ndash; Any child who cannot maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> airway requires endotracheal intubation. Patients in this category may exhibit the following findings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to phonate or produce audible breath sounds despite respiratory effort (complete airway obstruction) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;, section on 'Signs of airway obstruction'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inspiratory, obstructive sounds with partial airway obstruction that fail to improve despite repositioning, airway maneuvers, or medical therapies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children#H324322281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired mental status including head injured patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of &le;8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>] and patients with systemic illness or poisoning because of the increased risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Patients with depressed mental status can be assessed clinically for loss of protective airway reflexes. In particular, determining a patient's ability to swallow and handle secretions provides the most reliable indication of adequate airway protection. Studies suggest that swallowing and airway protective reflexes may in fact be centrally integrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Though commonly assessed, the gag reflex is a less useful indicator of airway status for several reasons: (1) The gag reflex correlates poorly with GCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; (2) A gag may not be elicited in more than one third of healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; (3) The absence of a gag reflex in patients with prior neurological insults does not correlate with risk of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; (4) Attempting to gag a patient to determine the need for intubation increases the risk of vomiting in those whose reflex remains intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Potential for clinical deterioration</strong> &ndash; Children whose condition will likely deteriorate, such as those with thermal inhalation injuries or epiglottitis, require early intubation in a controlled fashion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epiglottitis-supraglottitis-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Management&quot;, section on 'Patient able to maintain airway'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other illnesses, such as severe anaphylaxis or asthma exacerbations, may initially be treated with aggressive medical therapies. However, clinical response must be continuously assessed, with a clear endpoint and plan for airway intervention if the patient does not improve and respiratory failure is anticipated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-acute-severe-asthma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in acute severe asthma&quot;, section on 'the decision to intubate'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, patients with sepsis may be intubated based on their anticipated course, as well as to maximize oxygen delivery and relieve energy expenditure related to increased work of breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prolonged diagnostic studies or patient transport</strong> &ndash; Control of the airway through intubation may be the safest alternative for some patients with combative or unstable conditions who require prolonged diagnostic studies. This is particularly true during computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, where assessment and support of the child's airway will be less accessible in the event of an acute change. Intubation is also suggested for any patient at risk for deterioration prior to transfer to another facility. Securing the airway prior to departure avoids the need for emergency advanced airway management in a less controlled setting such as an ambulance or a helicopter transport.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and management of the airway is always the first priority in caring for acutely ill or injured children. Thus, there are no absolute contraindications for endotracheal intubation (ETI) by appropriately trained providers.</p><p>Relative contraindications are uncommon but do exist and primarily relate to the need to move to a more controlled environment or to perform a surgical approach to the airway:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In order to preserve airway reflexes and spontaneous respiratory efforts in case of a failed intubation, rapid sequence intubation with neuromuscular blockade should be avoided in patients who are known or expected to be difficult to intubate and difficult to ventilate with bag and mask, without an appropriate back up plan in place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a known or suspected laryngeal fracture should be intubated with caution because of the risk of further disrupting a partial laryngeal transection, resulting in complete loss of the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk intubations (eg, epiglottitis) are most safely performed in the controlled environment of the operating room whenever delay secondary to transport will not compromise patient outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80169\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80169 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although very rare, the unstable surgical patient (eg, penetrating trauma to the larynx) deemed to require a surgical airway should not have airway efforts delayed by attempts at direct laryngoscopy and ETI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic features of the airways of infants and children that affect the approach to intubation are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouth and oropharynx</strong> &ndash; The lips define the entrance to the mouth. Immediately behind the lips are the teeth extruding from the gingiva. The mouth is bound superiorly by the hard and soft palate, laterally by buccal mucosa, and inferiorly by the tongue. The uvula hangs down from the roof of the mouth in the midline, and the tonsils lie laterally just behind the palatoglossal folds which define the entrance to the oropharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69766 \">figure 1</a>). The oropharynx extends inferiorly to the epiglottis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypopharynx</strong> &ndash; Below the oropharynx is the hypopharynx which extends from the epiglottis to the cricoid cartilage. The epiglottis attaches to the anterior aspect of the hypopharynx and drapes over the glottis. At the junction of the base of the tongue and the epiglottis is a space known as the vallecula. At the base of the vallecula lies the hyoepiglottic ligament, which connects the epiglottis to the hyoid bone anteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59721 \">figure 2</a>). The larynx lies in the anterior portion of the hypopharynx, bounded laterally by the piriform recesses. Posteriorly lies the origination of the esophagus. Distinguishing the esophagus from the glottis is crucial during ETI. The esophageal opening has a puckered or ill-defined shape, and has smooth, homogeneous soft tissue structures surrounding it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78195 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Larynx</strong> &ndash; The larynx is defined anteriorly by the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage, the cricothyroid membrane, and the cricoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages (cuneiform and corniculate) make up the posterior aspect of the laryngeal inlet. These posterior cartilages are important landmarks as they are the first structures visualized as the epiglottis is lifted during laryngoscopy, and may be the only portion of the glottis visualized in some patients. The aryepiglottic folds, which connect the arytenoids to the epiglottis, make up the lateral borders of the laryngeal inlet. The true vocal cords originate below the epiglottic tubercle anteriorly and connect with the arytenoids posteriorly. The vocal cords cover the entrance to the trachea. An optimal laryngoscopic view will allow visualization of the entire length of both vocal cords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67789 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trachea</strong> &ndash; The trachea begins at the base of the cricoid cartilage, and ends inferiorly at the carina, which defines the bifurcation to the right and left mainstem bronchus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Success in airway management depends on careful patient assessment, implementation of an appropriate endotracheal intubation (ETI) plan, and gathering and testing of all necessary equipment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3954653339\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-intubation checklists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We support the active use of intubation checklists that include items on patient assessment, required equipment, and medications, customized to the setting as a means to reduce the frequency of errors during emergency endotracheal intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111721\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111721 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should perform a focused assessment of the child's history and physical findings to identify conditions and clinical features that will impact bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ETI.

Whenever possible, the procedure should be explained to both the parents and the child prior to intubation with emphasis on the indications for intubation and benefits of the procedure (eg, correction of hypoxemia or protection of the airway to prevent aspiration). </p><p>Key components of the discussion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications will provide sedation and pain control throughout the procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotracheal intubation may not be successful.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subsequent planned actions if the child cannot be successfully intubated.</p><p/><p>Urgency of this procedure often precludes extensive discussion about minor risks, including the possibility of oral or dental trauma and post-extubation throat discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials, equipment, and personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functioning airway equipment in a full range of sizes from neonate to <span class=\"nowrap\">adolescent/adult</span> should be readily available wherever critically ill or injured children receive medical care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71484 \">table 6</a>). Equipment should always be checked prior to performing this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371996\"><span class=\"h3\">Preintubation supplies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Personnel</strong> &ndash; Ideally, at least three practitioners are present during emergency intubation. In addition to the <span class=\"nowrap\">laryngoscopist/intubator,</span> an assistant can be utilized to perform external laryngeal manipulation, pass equipment, and watch the monitor, and an additional provider can be assigned to infuse medications when RSI is utilized. When possible, the resuscitation leader should <strong>not</strong> be the provider performing the intubation. A respiratory therapist, when available, can function as the assistant during intubation, and is particularly helpful to assist with ventilator management after intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring equipment</strong> &ndash; Any patient undergoing endotracheal (ET) intubation should be placed on continuous monitoring equipment including heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and continuous oxygen saturation monitoring. Capnography should be employed when available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Clinical applications for intubated patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxygen supply</strong> &ndash; Supplemental oxygen must be available, either from a wall source or a portable tank with a flow meter that allows at least 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Suction</strong> &ndash; Wall suction or portable devices should be available. Pressures should be limited to 80 to 120 mmHg to decrease the risk of trauma to airway mucosa. Yankauer or wide-bore tonsil tip catheters are most appropriate for suctioning particulate matter (eg, thick secretions and vomitus). Flexible suction catheters can be used for thin secretions in the nose, mouth, and hypopharynx, as well as for deep suctioning through the ET tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bag and mask</strong> &ndash; Selecting an appropriately sized bag and mask for bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;, section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BMV can provide a temporizing means for oxygenation and ventilation while preparing for intubation in the child in respiratory failure. In addition, children desaturate more quickly than adults during rapid sequence intubation and may require assisted ventilation after administration of sedatives or neuromuscular blockade agents and prior to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (ETI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BMV is as effective as ETI and ventilation for providing temporary respiratory support. For example, a randomized controlled trial of prehospital BMV versus ETI in 820 pediatric patients found no difference in survival to hospital discharge or good neurologic outcomes between the two groups.

Laryngoscope blades are either curved or straight. The choice of curved or straight blade is best made based on the experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. Curved blades have a large flange which facilitates displacement of the tongue, and a curve that allows easy placement in the vallecula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65358 \">figure 5</a>). A straight blade allows direct lifting of the epiglottis to expose the glottic opening, which may be preferred in infants and young children younger than two years of age in whom the epiglottis is often larger and more acutely angled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77129 \">figure 6</a>).

Generally, size 0 or 1 blades are used in average-sized newborns, and size 1 blades for most infants beyond the immediate newborn period.

It relies on the principle that the esophagus is collapsible under negative pressure, whereas the trachea (which is rigid) is not. The bulb is deflated and then placed on the end of the ET tube following intubation.

Depending upon the method used, the sensitivity for correct tube placement relative to chest radiograph or capnography varied from 91 to 100 percent and overall accuracy was 89 to 98 percent.

Capnography should be utilized to confirm and monitor endotracheal tube position after intubation.

This increased lung store of oxygen, in combination with the improved oxygen delivery within the circulation and body tissues, serves to delay or avoid hypoxemia resulting from prolonged apneic periods during endotracheal intubation. Thus, preoxygenation should be performed even in patients with normal oxygen saturation.</p><p>Patients without spontaneous respirations require immediate institution of bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with 100 percent inspired oxygen.</p><p>Preoxygenation has traditionally included administration of 100 percent FiO<sub>2</sub> for three to five minutes in the spontaneously breathing patient. Although two minutes may be sufficient in healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], emergency intubations are often performed in patients with compromised pulmonary function or respiratory effort who may benefit from more prolonged oxygen delivery prior to the procedure. In general, children have less functional residual capacity and higher oxygen utilization and, thus, will become hypoxic more quickly than adults, regardless of the method of preoxygenation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Lower functional residual capacity'</a>.)</p><p>In cooperative adult patients, eight vital capacity breaths with 100 percent FiO<sub>2</sub> provides a more rapid means of achieving similar PaO<sub>2</sub> levels and time to desaturation than the traditional method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Materials, equipment, and personnel'</a> above.) </p><p>Compared with direct laryngoscopy, video laryngoscopy may improve the chance of successful intubation of children with difficult airways (eg, limited mouth opening, cervical spine immobility, or severe micrognathia due to genetic syndromes such as Pierre Robin or Treacher Collins). However, in otherwise normal children undergoing intubation by experienced providers, the use of video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy is not necessarily associated with improved outcomes such as fewer adverse events or first-pass success rate and may result in longer intubation times. However, there are other advantages to video laryngoscopy, including a shared view of the airway anatomy and procedure progress that permits other clinicians to provide guidance during the procedure, as well as the ability to record intubations for subsequent educational and quality assurance purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H1983656922\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Whenever possible, an assistant should stand to the right of the patient's head to assist with optimal positioning and to hand items to the intubator. Once the child is completely relaxed, the following steps are performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opening the mouth</strong> &ndash; The mouth is opened using either of two techniques: a scissor technique in which the thumb of the operator's right hand pushes the lower incisors (or mandibular gum) caudad while the index finger (placed posterior to the thumb) pushes the upper incisors (or maxillary gum) cephalad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56734\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56734 \">picture 6</a>), <strong>or</strong> in a patient without cervical spine restrictions, extension of the head will naturally open the mouth (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above). This can be augmented by applying caudad pressure on the chin using the fifth finger of the left hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77129 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inserting the laryngoscope</strong> &ndash; The laryngoscope is held in the left hand, regardless of the practitioner's hand dominance. The most common approach is to insert the blade into the right side of the patient's mouth, taking care not to catch the lower lip against the teeth, which may lacerate the lip. Asking an assistant to retract the lip off the teeth can be helpful. Within the oral cavity, the blade is passed under direct visualization along the base of the tongue following the natural contour of the pharynx. The tongue is swept to the left as the laryngoscope is advanced into midline of the hypopharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54262 \">figure 10</a>). An alternative approach is to pass the blade down the midline. The advantage of this method is that it may avoid the blade getting caught on pharyngeal folds and may also allow for easier identification of recognizable anatomic structures such as the epiglottis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Retracting the tongue and soft tissues</strong> &ndash; Once in the midline of the oropharynx, the laryngoscope blade should be used to lift the mandibular block. This can be accomplished by applying force away from the laryngoscopist along the long axis of the handle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65358 \">figure 5</a>). The laryngoscope should not be &quot;rocked&quot; backward, using the upper palate or incisors as the fulcrum for leverage. This improper technique will decrease the space within the oral cavity, making it difficult to pass the ET tube under direct visualization. In addition, injury to the mouth, gingiva, or teeth can occur when the blade is levered against these structures. Keeping the wrist straight will help prevent inadvertent levering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identifying glottic structures</strong> &ndash; After the tongue and soft tissues have been retracted, the aim is to identify recognizable anatomic structures within the extrathoracic airway. As the laryngoscope blade is advanced into the pharynx, the epiglottis will often come immediately into view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69513 \">figure 11</a>). This is the landmark that is most useful when identifying the remainder of the glottic structures. At this point, suction is often needed to remove saliva, blood, or debris and optimize the glottic view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of laryngoscopic adjustments can be made if the epiglottis is not seen immediately:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The epiglottis may be lying flat against the posterior pharyngeal wall or folded on itself, making it difficult to distinguish from surrounding mucosal surfaces. Additional elevation of the mandibular block may help separate the epiglottic rim from surrounding tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The laryngoscope blade may not be midline, often as a result of challenges in sweeping the tongue from right to left. Repositioning the blade using the uvula as a midline reference point may be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If neither the epiglottis nor the glottic structures are visible, the laryngoscope blade can be advanced fully, placing the blade tip in the esophagus. The blade is then pulled back slowly. The first structure to fall into view will be the glottis, followed by the epiglottis. Some experts recommend routine use of this approach with blind insertion beyond the larynx and locating identifiable structures as the blade is withdrawn, particularly when intubating infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevating the epiglottis</strong> &ndash; After the epiglottis has been identified, it needs to be elevated to expose the underlying vocal cords and glottic opening. The technique employed varies based on the type of blade being used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When using a straight blade, the tip of the blade is positioned under the epiglottis to lift it directly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77129 \">figure 6</a>). The epiglottis is frequently large, floppy, and covered with airway secretions and therefore may easily slide off the blade. If this occurs, the blade should be repositioned beneath the epiglottis and it should be carefully lifted again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When using a curved blade, the tip of the blade is pressed against the deepest portion of the vallecula to place tension on the hyoepiglottic ligament, which will help suspend the epiglottis. Once the blade (straight or curved) is positioned correctly, force is applied upward and forward along the long axis of laryngoscope handle at approximately 45 degrees. This will lift the mandibular block and the epiglottis to expose the glottic opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65358 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78195 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541238534\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjusting for suboptimal view</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, with appropriate positioning and laryngoscopy, the vocal cords and glottic aperture will be quickly identified. In selected pediatric patients external laryngeal manipulation and cricoid pressure may be needed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>External laryngeal manipulation (bimanual laryngoscopy or BURP maneuver)</strong> &ndash; If little or none of the glottic opening is visualized despite appropriate positioning of the patient and the laryngoscope blade, external laryngeal manipulation (ELM) may improve the view in some patients (eg, children with anteriorly placed airways due to congenital anomalies or trauma patients undergoing intubation with cervical spinal motion restriction in place). However, routine use of ELM in children has <strong>not</strong> been associated with improved first pass success rates and may not be beneficial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bimanual laryngoscopy, also called ELM, entails manipulating the thyroid cartilage or hyoid bone with the right hand in order to improve the view of the glottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64433 \">picture 7</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults&quot;, section on 'Bimanual laryngoscopy (external laryngeal manipulation)'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While holding the laryngoscope in the left hand, posterior displacement of the larynx is achieved with external pressure applied at the thyroid cartilage with the right hand. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once the optimal glottic view is obtained, the laryngoscopist has an assistant place their fingers in exactly the same spot on the thyroid cartilage, using the same direction and degree of force necessary to maintain the view. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) is applied to the larynx by an assistant. The BURP maneuver has been demonstrated to improve glottic exposure in some patients by moving the larynx more into the line of vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]; however, it may compromise visualization when used in conjunction with traditional cricoid pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data regarding the use of external laryngeal manipulation in pediatric airway management is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. In a retrospective study of an international multicenter registry of over 7800 infants and children undergoing endotracheal intubation in pediatric intensive care units, ELM was associated with lower first-pass successful intubation(unadjusted first-pass success with and without ELM 59 versus 68 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This lower success rate for ELM remained significant after adjusted analysis (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.95) although residual confounding may contribute to this finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cricoid pressure</strong> &ndash; Because external laryngeal manipulation may better improve visualization of the glottis, we generally prefer to use this technique rather than cricoid pressure during laryngoscopy in most patients undergoing RSI. On the other hand, due to the anterior position of the glottis in young infants, gentle cricoid pressure, applied over the anterior neck at the cricoid cartilage, may improve the glottic view. When used, it should be applied after the sedative is administered and the patient becomes unconscious. If cricoid pressure worsens the view, it should be removed immediately and external laryngeal manipulation attempted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cricoid pressure may also help prevent gastric insufflation during bag-mask ventilation and is considered optional for this purpose. However, during RSI, bag-mask ventilation should be avoided, whenever possible (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;, section on 'Protection'</a>). If cricoid pressure makes bag-mask ventilation more difficult due to occlusion of the airway, then it should be relaxed or removed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cricoid pressure has historically been used in rapid sequence intubation to prevent gastric insufflation during bag-mask ventilation and passive regurgitation of gastric contents during laryngoscopy and intubation. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of cricoid pressure for preventing regurgitation and ELM may better improve visualization of the glottis. Therefore, we prefer to use the ELM technique during rapid sequence intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Passing the endotracheal tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the glottic opening has been identified, the final step is passage of the endotracheal (ET) tube. While maintaining a view of the glottic opening, the intubator receives the tube in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> right hand from a previously assigned assistant. The tube is held like a pencil, between the thumb and first two fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66376 \">figure 12</a>). Having an assistant place traction on the right corner of the mouth can provide improved visualization and additional room to accommodate the ET tube entering the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68341 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p>The tube enters the right side of the mouth and is advanced toward the larynx in a horizontal plane. Passage of the tube directly along the barrel of the laryngoscope blade will obscure the view of the glottic opening, and should be avoided. The ET tube should be passed through the vocal cords under direct visualization. Once the tip has passed through the vocal cords, the tube is rotated to the upright position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68466\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68466 \">figure 14</a>). Although the tendency is for the intubator to move closer to the patient to improve view, this may compromise binocular vision and depth perception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Depth of insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal location for the endotracheal (ET) tube tip is at the midpoint between the thoracic inlet and the carina. There are a number of ways to guide the proper depth of insertion for the ET tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placing the double line on the uncuffed ET tube at the glottis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the depth provided by the length-based resuscitation tape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inserting the tube until the centimeter marking at the lip is three times the internal diameter of the ET tube</p><p/><p>This last calculation will result in the ET tube being correctly positioned more than 80 percent of the time, when using an appropriately size ET tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Additional techniques, less commonly used during emergent intubation, include deliberately advancing the ET tube to create an endobronchial intubation and then withdrawing the tube 2 cm beyond the passage of the carina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], and palpation of the tube tip at the suprasternal notch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Initiate positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laryngoscope can now be removed from the mouth while the tube is held securely against the roof of the mouth, or by grasping the tube using the index finger and thumb with the remaining three fingers holding the patient's face. If a cuffed tube is being used, the cuff should be inflated at this time.</p><p>Positive pressure ventilation should be initiated with 100 percent inspired oxygen via a resuscitation bag with a carbon dioxide detector attached to the endotracheal (ET) tube. The bag should initially be squeezed with enough force and volume to provide chest wall movement.</p><p>Subsequent ventilatory strategies can be made based on noninvasive measures of oxygenation and ventilation or based on results of blood gas analyses. If a large air leak is noted at this time, cuff inflation may be adjusted accordingly. However, persistent leak may require the tube to be changed to a larger size.</p><p>If an uncuffed ET tube is in place, then the air leak pressures should ideally occur at less than 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, while still allowing for effective ventilation.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Materials, equipment, and personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although evidence is preliminary, bedside ultrasound can rapidly confirm intratracheal position when used by properly trained clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H2372004\" class=\"local\">'Postintubation and alternative airway supplies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10899057\"><span class=\"h3\">Securing the tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After correct tube position is confirmed, cricoid pressure can be released if it had been utilized during the intubation. The ET tube must be firmly secured. The most common approach is to tear longitudinally down the midline of a length of cloth or silk tape, creating a Y-shape. One segment is wrapped around the tube and the base segment is placed across the cheek (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80704 \">figure 15</a>). Preparing the underlying skin with a layer of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzoin</a>, which is allowed to air dry, can provide additional adherence. Alternatively, commercial tracheal tube holders may be utilized to secure the ETT. These devices have been shown to be rapidly applied in adults and to have reasonable resistance to extubation forces, although in most instances, tape is stronger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, commercial endotracheal tube holders have not been specifically studied in infants and young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-intubation care</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-intubation imaging</strong> &ndash; After immediate confirmation of ET tube placement as described above, an anterior-posterior chest radiograph should be obtained to confirm the location of the tip of the ET tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Optimal position is located at a minimum of one to three centimeters above the carina and below the thoracic inlet. Tube depth may be adjusted based on radiographic position. Preliminary evidence suggests that bedside ultrasound, performed by clinicians experienced with this technique, may also be useful for directly determining the position of the ET tube within the trachea, or confirming appropriate position by documenting bilateral lung sliding. However, this is not common practice at this time and should not replace radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastric decompression</strong> &ndash; An orogastric or nasogastric tube should be placed following intubation to decompress the stomach. Gastric distension can occur secondary to crying or insufflation following BMV. In addition, because emergency intubation may be performed on non-fasted patients, residual gastric contents may be present and should be evacuated. Gastric decompression can decrease the risk of aspiration around the ETT, as well as improve diaphragmatic excursion and patient ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minimize head movement</strong> &ndash; Care must be taken to avoid significant head movement in patients who have been intubated. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage of ETTs can become malpositioned with neck movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].

Monitoring via continuous pulse oximetry is essential to recognize inadequate oxygenation. If desaturation occurs, the intubation attempt should be discontinued. Before another attempt is initiated, the patient should receive BMV until oxyhemoglobin saturations improve. If cricoid pressure is in place, then it should be continued during BMV provided it is not compromising ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">An alternative approach is to time laryngoscopy duration during the intubation attempt and discontinue it if the attempt is unsuccessful within a specific time period (eg, 30 seconds). This may prevent oxyhemoglobin desaturation during pediatric rapid sequence intubation but may also result in more laryngoscopy attempts. In one observational study that used video review of 114 children (median age 2.4 years) undergoing rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric emergency department, at least one episode of oxyhemoglobin desaturation (pulse oximetry &lt;90 percent) occurred in 33 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation was more common in children two years of age or younger compared to older children (59 versus 10 percent) and was strongly associated with the duration of laryngoscopy; 82 percent of patients experiencing desaturations had laryngoscopy durations of 30 seconds or longer. There was no association between the number of intubation attempts and desaturation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bradycardia</strong> &ndash; Profound bradycardia can occur during laryngoscopy and intubation as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vagal response from stimulation of the hypopharynx, lifting the epiglottis, or rarely, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a> can lead to bradycardia, particularly in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypoxemia can also result in secondary bradycardia in infants.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Atropine</a> may help prevent vagal mediated bradycardia but will be ineffective in cases of hypoxemia.
