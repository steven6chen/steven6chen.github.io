There are over 100 different types of HPV; however, most types of HPV do not cause cancer. At least 80 percent of women are exposed to the HPV virus during their lifetime. Most of the time, the body's immune system gets rid of the virus before it does harm.</p><p>Researchers have labeled the HPV types as being high or low risk for causing cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-risk HPV types &ndash; HPV types 6 and 11 can cause genital warts and are low-risk types because they rarely cause cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk HPV types &ndash; High-risk HPV types may cause cervical cancer in some women. Although most women who are infected with the high-risk HPV types do not develop cervical cancer, women who test positive for high-risk HPV over many years are at a higher risk of cervical cancer. HPV types 16 and 18 are two of the high-risk types.</p><p/><p>HPV is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact, including sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, or any other contact involving the genital area (eg, hand-to-genital contact). It is not possible to become infected with HPV by touching an object, such as a toilet seat. Most people who are infected with HPV have no signs or symptoms. Most HPV infections are temporary and resolve within two years. When the virus persists (in 10 to 20 percent of cases), there is a chance of developing cervical precancer or cancer. However, it usually takes many years for HPV infection to cause cervical cancer.</p><p>Since HPV is transmitted by sexual contact, having multiple sexual partners is associated with an increased risk for cervical cancer. Condoms provide only partial protection. Smoking can increase the risk of cervical cancer up to fourfold, as does having a condition or taking a medicine that weakens the immune system.</p><p>A vaccine to help prevent infection with some high-risk types of HPV is recommended for girls or women between the ages of 9 and 26 years and for boys or men between the ages of 9 and 21 years but can be given up to 26 years of age. Smoking cessation is recommended for those who smoke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to screen for cervical cancer. The traditional screening test is called a &quot;Pap test.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pap test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Pap test is a method of examining cells from the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77157\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77157 \">picture 1</a>). The cervix is located at the lower end of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>To perform a Pap test, a doctor or other health care provider will perform a pelvic exam and use a small brush or spatula to collect cells from the cervix. The cells are smeared on a glass slide (called a traditional Pap smear) or added to a preservative fluid (called liquid-based, thin layer testing). Studies that have compared the traditional Pap smear with liquid-based cytology do not prove one test to be more accurate than another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HPV test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A human papillomavirus (HPV) test can be done along with a Pap test or as a separate test. Like a Pap test, the HPV test is done during a pelvic exam, using a small brush to collect a sample from the cervix. HPV tests do not test for all different types of HPV. They test for the strains of HPV that are the highest risk for causing cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11175390\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR CERVICAL CANCER?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Younger women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, it is recommended that cervical cancer screening start at age 21; some other countries suggest that screening begin at age 25. Cervical cancer is very rare in younger women. Screening before age 21 in girls and women who are sexually active is not recommended because of the very high risk of false-positive results (that is, do not indicate a precancerous condition) because many human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in this group are temporary. There is concern that procedures done to follow-up on these results may impair a young woman&rsquo;s future fertility.</p><p>Even if you have had a vaccine for HPV, you will still need cervical cancer screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Older women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts feel that many women who are 65 years or older can stop having cervical cancer screening, though it depends on their risk factors.</p><p>For example, you may need to continue having cervical cancer screening beyond the age of 65 if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You smoke or used to smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have ever had an abnormal Pap test or an abnormal HPV test or been treated for cervical dysplasia (abnormal cells that can lead to cancer).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a new sexual partner since your last Pap test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) where you were in the womb &ndash; DES is a drug that was given to many women before 1981 to prevent pregnancy complications. Women who were exposed while in the womb have an increased risk of certain health problems, including cervical cancer, later in life.</p><p/><p>If you are 65 or older and do not have any of the above risk factors, most experts feel that you can stop having cervical cancer screening if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had screening tests on a regular basis in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had at least three normal Pap tests in a row or two normal combination Pap and HPV tests over the past 10 years, with the most recent within the past five years</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">After hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have had a total hysterectomy (your uterus and cervix were removed) do not need a Pap test, unless:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hysterectomy did not remove your cervix (eg, if the hysterectomy was &quot;subtotal&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hysterectomy was done because of cervical cancer or precancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during your mother's pregnancy</p><p/><p>Screening recommendations for average-risk women in the United States are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89435 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3770869798\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, experts recommended that every woman have a cervical cancer screening every year. This has changed. Depending on your age and how you are screened, screening is recommended every three or five years for most women over age 21.</p><p>More frequent testing may be needed if test results are not normal, or for women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease or other specific immune system conditions.</p><p>Screening recommendations for average-risk women in the United States are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89435 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARING FOR YOUR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Pap test or human papillomavirus (HPV) test can be done at any time during your menstrual cycle.
