Without repair, ruptured AAA is nearly uniformly fatal. Of the 50 percent of patients with ruptured AAA who reach the hospital for treatment, between 30 and 50 percent will die in the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>For asymptomatic patients, elective repair of the aneurysm is the most effective management to prevent rupture. However, elective aortic surgery is also associated with risks, and thus, elective AAA repair is not recommended until the risk of rupture exceeds the risks associated with repair. For asymptomatic patients, the risk of AAA rupture generally exceeds the risk associated with elective AAA repair when aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Other factors such as the patient's age, rate of aneurysm expansion, and the presence of coexistent peripheral artery disease or peripheral aneurysm are also important to consider when determining when to proceed with elective AAA repair. </p><p>For patients with asymptomatic AAA who do not have indications for elective repair, medical treatment is aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk in the event that AAA repair is needed and limiting the rate of aortic expansion. When elective AAA repair is indicated, the choice between open and endovascular AAA repair remains debated. Although elective endovascular AAA repair is associated with lower rates of perioperative (30-day) morbidity and mortality compared with elective open repair (&lt;2 versus approximately 5 percent), long-term outcomes are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The management of the patient with asymptomatic AAA will be reviewed here.

However, elective aortic surgery is associated with risks, and thus, elective AAA repair is not recommended until the risk of rupture exceeds the risks associated with repair (anesthetic risk, technique-related risks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For asymptomatic patients, randomized trials comparing observation with open or endovascular AAA repair have found that the risk of AAA rupture generally does not exceed the risk associated with elective AAA repair until aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. We agree with guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery that recommend observation for asymptomatic AAA &lt;5.5 cm in diameter based upon these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Since it is uncommon for AAAs smaller than 5 cm to rupture, many vascular surgeons adopted this measurement as an indication for elective repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. As an example, in one systematic review that included 21 studies of patients with AAA also reporting AAA outcomes, 37 of 2323 (1.6 percent) with small AAA went on to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Larger aneurysm diameter and faster rate of aneurysm expansion correlate to an increased likelihood of symptoms and complications.

Whether this represented optimal management was addressed in randomized trials comparing aneurysm repair with nonoperative management plus surveillance imaging for medium-sized aneurysms (4.0 to 5.5 cm), with two trials using open AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and three later trials using endovascular aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/10-12,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,25,26</a>]. Independent meta-analyses of these trials have found no advantage to early repair (open or endovascular) for AAA measuring 4.0 to 5.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3586232\"><span class=\"h4\">Observation versus open repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United Kingdom (UK) Small Aneurysm and (US) Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) trials, which were predominantly composed of men, the risk of death due to rupture during the period of surveillance of medium-sized (4.0 to 4.4 cm) AAA was lower than the risk of death from open AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8,9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,28</a>]. A later analysis pooled results from both trials and found no differences in survival between immediate open repair and surveillance (2.6- to 8-year follow-up) for any diameter in the range of 4 to 5.5 cm, for men or women, or for any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis in 2007 of these trials found no significant differences in all-cause mortality between the groups at five- to eight-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The important points of these trials are summarized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UK Small Aneurysm trial &ndash; The UK Small Aneurysm trial randomly assigned 1090 patients (83 percent men) with asymptomatic AAA with a diameter of 4.0 to 5.5 cm to elective surgery or observation with ultrasound surveillance every six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31</a>]. Open surgical repair was performed if the aneurysm diameter exceeded 5.5 cm, expanded more than 10 mm in a year, or became tender or symptomatic. The two groups had similar cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. After a mean follow-up of eight years, the following findings were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An initial survival advantage was apparent for patients in the observation group because of a 30-day operative mortality of 5.4 percent. However, at eight-year follow-up, mortality was significantly lower for patients who underwent elective surgery (43 versus 48 percent). Equipoise between the therapies was achieved at approximately five years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76015 \">figure 3</a>) (the point at which the area under the survival curve is equal).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mean duration of survival was the same in the two groups (6.7 versus 6.5 years) since early mortality was offset by improved late survival in the group that underwent surgery. The authors ascribe the improved late survival in the surgery group to beneficial changes in lifestyle, particularly smoking cessation, which was more frequent in this group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>During follow-up of the surveillance group, the median aneurysm growth rate was 3.3 mm per year and the mean risk of aneurysm rupture was 1.6 percent per year during the initial follow-up period but increased to 3.2 percent per year during the last three years of follow-up, as expected, since the aneurysms under surveillance were larger during this later time period. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of AAA rupture was four times higher in women compared with men (hazard ratio [HR] 4.0, 95% CI 2.0-7.9). The incidence of fatal rupture was also significantly greater for women compared with men (19 versus 14 percent). (See <a href=\"#H3585407\" class=\"local\">'Female gender'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADAM trial &ndash; The Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) Trial randomly assigned 1136 patients (over 99 percent male) aged 50 to 79 years with AAA diameter between 4.0 to 5.4 cm to open aneurysm repair or surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Elective surgery was performed when the aneurysm expanded to &gt;5.5 cm or became symptomatic. Operative mortality in this trial was 2.7 percent. After 4.9 years of follow-up, there were no differences in mortality (25 versus 21.5 percent) or aneurysm-related death (3 versus 2.6 percent) between the surgery and surveillance groups. In the surveillance arm, 62 percent of the patients eventually required surgery. AAA rupture occurred in 1.9 percent (0.6 percent per year).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3586239\"><span class=\"h4\">Observation versus endovascular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UK Small Aneurysm Trial and the ADAM trial were performed prior to the widespread use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Two trials comparing EVAR to observation for AAA &lt;5.5 cm similarly found no significant long-term differences between AAA repair and nonoperative management, and these studies lend further support to the 5.5-cm threshold established from earlier randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/10,11,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,25,26</a>]. In spite of the lower perioperative mortality rate associated with EVAR, there appears to be no advantage to elective EVAR repair for small and medium-sized aneurysms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3585400\"><span class=\"h2\">Other considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A decision for elective repair of asymptomatic AAA relies primarily on determining rupture risk based upon aneurysm diameter &gt;5.5 cm. However, the diameter threshold for repair is not absolute. Deciding when to perform elective AAA repair should also take into account the natural history of AAA and factors that increase the risk for aneurysm expansion or rupture such as advanced age, female gender, and ongoing smoking, as well as expansion rates. Timing of AAA repair may also be affected by coexistent vascular disease or other peripheral artery aneurysms. The risk factors associated with AAA expansion and rupture are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H1614399424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Expansion and rupture of AAA'</a>.)</p><p>Some studies have also identified disparities in rupture rates based upon insurance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Differences are multifactorial but can be explained in part by lower surveillance rates for patients with known AAA for patients eligible for Medicaid insurance. This finding highlights the need for and value of surveillance for all patients with AAA that does not meet criteria for operative repair, preferably using a standardized protocol. (See <a href=\"#H766539\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3585407\"><span class=\"h3\">Female gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in demographics, natural history, and outcomes have raised interest in better defining the value that determines the presence of AAA in women and, furthermore, the ideal threshold for repair. Randomized trials that have determined these values, as discussed above, are comprised predominately of men. (See <a href=\"#H3586739\" class=\"local\">'Randomized trials'</a> above.)</p><p>For women, a lower threshold of 5 cm may be justified for elective repair of asymptomatic AAA due to the higher rate of rupture in women compared with men for AAA of the same diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34,35</a>]. Using a smaller diameter of aorta as the threshold for diagnosis would alter the commonly cited prevalence of AAA for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and might improve the likelihood of women being offered repair. Moreover, the proportion of women who meet all eligibility criteria for endovascular repair related to anatomy may decrease as aortic diameter increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the impact of this on overall survival is less certain. Perioperative mortality with AAA repair is higher using current indications for repair, and as a result, women may be more likely to die from early intervention than from rupture during ongoing surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. On the other hand, mortality following repair of AAA at a lower threshold diameter is unknown. It may be similar or worse, or possibly improved if such patients are more medically fit with more favorable anatomy at the time of repair. </p><p>Based on the studies below and others, a reasonable compromise may be to offer AAA repair at the lower threshold of 5.0 cm to women who are at low operative risk, while using the typical threshold for women who have a higher operative risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-48</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review comparing AAA in women with men, a higher proportion of women were not offered intervention (34 versus 19 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2, four studies), a smaller proportion of women were considered eligible for endovascular repair (34 versus 54 percent; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.62, five studies), and, when repair was performed, operative mortality was higher for women regardless of the method of repair (EVAR: 2.3 versus 1.4 percent; OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.0; open repair: 5.4 versus 2.8 percent, OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3, nine studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 4045 patients from the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) database that included 890 women, aneurysm diameter alone was most predictive of rupture for men, whereas for women, aortic size index (ASI = aneurysm diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">[cm]/body</span> surface area [m<sup>2</sup>]) was predictive (ASI &gt;3.5-3.9: OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.7-24.1; ASI &ge;4.0: OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.3-39.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Survival was similar for both women and men independent of treatment (open repair or surveillance). Survival for women was also similar for moderate-size AAA (5.0 to 5.4 cm) versus smaller (&lt;4.0 to 5 cm) aneurysms.

In a multivariate analysis, gaps in surveillance remained the largest predictor of rupture after adjusting for medical comorbidities (OR 5.82, 95% CI, 4.64-7.31).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant anxiety is often associated with a diagnosis of AAA, and many patients find reassurance with a fixed surveillance interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>], although, for many patients, these anxieties may be reduced with proper education.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual clinical examination and risk reduction assessment can be performed concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/190,191\" class=\"abstract_t\">190,191</a>].</p><p/><p>There is interest in using AAA sac volume for surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/192-194\" class=\"abstract_t\">192-194</a>]. AAA sac volume has been noted in research studies to change when AAA diameter has not; however, the significance of this observation is unknown.

Two methods of aneurysm repair are currently available: open surgery and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The mortality of elective AAA repair is 3 to 5 percent for open AAA repair but lower at 0.5 to 2 percent for EVAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/195-197\" class=\"abstract_t\">195-197</a>]. When choosing the type of repair, it is important to take into account the patient's expected survival (short-term and long-term), which depends upon the patient's age and medical comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H3585830\" class=\"local\">'Medical risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open AAA repair &ndash; Open aneurysm repair involves replacement of the diseased aortic segment with a tube or bifurcated prosthetic graft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56289 \">figure 5</a>) through a midline abdominal or retroperitoneal incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/198\" class=\"abstract_t\">198</a>]. With technical refinements for open AAA repair, complications such as acute renal failure, distal embolization, wound infection, colonic ischemia, false aneurysm formation, aorto-duodenal fistula, graft infection, and perioperative bleeding have become less common following routine elective surgery but remain significant issues following emergent open AAA repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EVAR &ndash; EVAR involves the placement of modular graft components delivered via the iliac or femoral arteries to line the aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56289 \">figure 5</a>) and exclude the aneurysm sac from the circulation. EVAR requires fulfillment of specific anatomic criteria. Up to 70 percent of patients are EVAR candidates. This percentage is expected to increase with the approval of specialized endograft designs that will allow the treatment of more challenging aortic aneurysm anatomy. Although EVAR is associated with lower perioperative mortality, late AAA rupture has been reported. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H786575\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary of indications for elective AAA repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repair of asymptomatic AAA is generally indicated under the circumstances listed below.

A pooled analysis of these trials identified a 69 percent reduction in the risk for perioperative mortality for endovascular compared with open repair (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.17-0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/207\" class=\"abstract_t\">207</a>]. EVAR appears to be associated with the need for more secondary procedures and an ongoing future risk of aortic rupture. However, there appears to be no significant differences in overall complication rates when all complications for each procedure are included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/208\" class=\"abstract_t\">208</a>].

All patients had AAA &gt;5 cm in maximal diameter and were suitable candidates for either technique. </p><p>The perioperative (30-day) mortality rate was lower for EVAR compared with open AAA repair (1.2 versus 4.6 percent), though this result was not significant. At two-years post-randomization, the cumulative rates of aneurysm-related death remained less for EVAR (2.1 versus 5.7 percent) compared with open repair, a difference that was entirely due to the initial perioperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/200\" class=\"abstract_t\">200</a>]. However, there were no significant differences in overall survival (89.7 percent for EVAR and 89.6 percent for open repair). The perioperative survival advantage seen with EVAR was not sustained after the first postoperative year, due to an increase in non-aneurysm-related mortality in the EVAR group. These results were maintained at six years with survival rates for EVAR at 68.9 percent and open repair at 69.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/201\" class=\"abstract_t\">201</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>The rate of moderate and severe systemic complications was significantly lower for EVAR (11.7 versus 26.4 percent) compared with open repair.

The need for secondary vascular intervention was significantly higher for EVAR (29.6 versus 18.1 percent) compared with open repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3594590\"><span class=\"h3\">EVAR 1 trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair in patients with AAA (EVAR1) trial randomly assigned 1252 patients to AAA repair with EVAR (n = 626) or open AAA repair (n = 626) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/202\" class=\"abstract_t\">202</a>]. Perioperative (30-day) mortality was significantly less for EVAR (1.8 versus 4.3 percent). No significant differences were seen in overall mortality, and graft-related complications occurred more frequently with EVAR. New complications related to EVAR continued to occur out to eight years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The early benefit of EVAR was lost beginning approximately&nbsp;eight years after randomization due to late fatal secondary aneurysm ruptures. Over a mean of 12.7 years of follow-up, the overall mortality rate was similar (9.3 versus 8.9 deaths per 100 person-years for the EVAR and open groups, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/209\" class=\"abstract_t\">209</a>]. However, aneurysm-related mortality was significantly increased for EVAR after eight years (7 versus 1 percent) and was mainly attributable to secondary aneurysm sac rupture. Whether newer-generation stent-grafts would have these same long-term aneurysm-related risks is unknown;&nbsp;over one-third of the stent-graft devices received by the enrollees in this study are no longer used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/202\" class=\"abstract_t\">202</a>].&nbsp;Another finding of longer-term follow-up was that the number of cancer deaths was 50 of 179 in the EVAR group and 31 of 154 in the open group (after eight years, adjusted hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.19-2.96).&nbsp;No other study has observed an increased cancer risk with the use of aortic stent-grafts. In the EVAR group, 37 of 50 of these cancer deaths were described as &quot;other&quot; (ie, not lung cancer). If these were abdominal cancers, their increased detection could be related to more frequent surveillance. Based upon estimated cancer risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/210,211\" class=\"abstract_t\">210,211</a>], it is unlikely these can be attributed to imaging-related radiation exposure. </p><p>Reintervention rates were significantly higher for EVAR compared with open repair. A criticism of this trial was that all complications related to open repair, such as incisional hernia, were not included in the study. The short-term benefit of EVAR was lost due to late fatal aneurysm ruptures. The authors concluded that treatment by EVAR significantly reduced the operative mortality compared with open repair, but there were no long-term advantages of one type of repair for aneurysm-related or overall mortality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3594604\"><span class=\"h3\">OVER trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial is an ongoing multicenter trial at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers that randomly assigned 881 veterans &ge;49 with AAA &gt;5.0 cm, an associated iliac aneurysm with maximal diameter &ge;3.0 cm, or a diameter of &ge;4.5 cm with rapid enlargement (defined as 0.5 cm growth in six months or 1.0 cm in one year) to open AAA repair or EVAR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

A separate database review also found similar complication rates between open and endovascular repair when all complications were included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/208\" class=\"abstract_t\">208</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3594618\"><span class=\"h3\">ACE trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Aneurysme de l'aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese (ACE) trial randomly assigned 316 patients with AAA &gt;5 cm to EVAR or open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/203\" class=\"abstract_t\">203</a>].

Surveillance of endovascular stent grafts over an extended period of time exposes the patient to greater levels of cumulative radiation; however, ultrasound surveillance is becoming more common.

Approximately 7000 deaths per year are attributed to ruptured AAA in the United States. Without repair, ruptured AAA is nearly uniformly fatal. For asymptomatic patients, elective repair of the aneurysm is the most effective management to prevent rupture. (See <a href=\"#H611107773\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with asymptomatic infrarenal AAA &lt;5.5 cm, we recommend conservative management (watchful waiting) rather than elective AAA repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The risk of aneurysm rupture does not exceed the risk of repair until the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.5 cm. For good risk surgical candidates (open or endovascular repair) with AAA &gt;5.5 cm, we recommend elective AAA repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Situations for which elective repair of asymptomatic AAA &lt;5.5 cm may also be appropriate include (see <a href=\"#H1191820574\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm repair versus conservative management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapidly expanding (&gt;0.5 cm in six months or &gt;1 cm per year) infrarenal AAA in well-documented serial studies. Rapid expansion may represent instability of the aortic wall, and some studies suggest that rapidly expanding AAAs have a higher risk of rupture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with associated arterial disease such as coexisting iliac, femoral, or popliteal artery aneurysms, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the same diameter of AAA, the risk for AAA rupture is higher for women than for men. Elective repair of asymptomatic AAA &gt;5 cm may be appropriate; however, the risk of death from elective repair is also increased in women. A lower threshold for repair is best reserved for women who have a low risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AAA &gt;5.5 cm who have a short life expectancy (&lt;2 years) due to advanced comorbidities, particularly cardiopulmonary disease or malignancy, we suggest no repair over endovascular aneurysm repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For these patients and others who elect not to undergo repair, ongoing AAA surveillance is <strong>not</strong> needed. The patient should be encouraged to create an advanced directive detailing their wishes for no repair of any kind in the event of rupture. Family members should be made aware of these wishes, given that the patient may not be able to report his or her wishes at the time of aneurysm rupture. (See <a href=\"#H3586992\" class=\"local\">'Counseling the high-risk patient'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1045680\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative management consists of periodic clinical evaluation and surveillance of aneurysm diameter to identify AAA that exceeds the threshold for repair or is rapidly expanding. Medical therapies for patients with AAA focus on the management of modifiable risk factors for AAA and cardiovascular disease with the goals of reducing the need for intervention due to aneurysm expansion or rupture, reducing morbidity and mortality associated with AAA repair, and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H3592986\" class=\"local\">'Conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with AAA who smoke, we recommend smoking cessation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Smoking is strongly associated with AAA expansion and rupture and is the most important modifiable risk factor. Even though reduced aneurysm expansion and rupture risk have not been clearly demonstrated among those who have stopped smoking, smoking cessation has other clear benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with AAA are considered to have a coronary equivalent. Statins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are considered appropriate therapies to decrease the risk of future cardiovascular events, as discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although many pharmacologic therapies aimed at limiting AAA expansion and preventing rupture have been tried, no therapy has been proven successful at achieving these goals, and as such, we suggest not implementing any of the pharmacologic therapies discussed above for the sole purpose of treating AAA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal surveillance schedule for patients who are not undergoing AAA repair has not been clearly defined. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of peripheral artery disease recommend surveillance every 6 to 12 months using ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) for medium-sized aneurysms (4.0 to 5.4 cm in diameter) but less frequent intervals for smaller aneurysms. We frequently perform surveillance on small aneurysms annually to minimize imaging variability and alleviate patient anxieties. Annual clinical examination and risk reduction assessment can also be performed concurrently with AAA surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H766539\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goals of aneurysm repair are to prevent rupture while minimizing morbidity and mortality associated with repair. Two methods of aneurysm repair are currently available: traditional open surgery and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). In randomized trials, EVAR is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open AAA repair but does not completely eliminate the future risk of AAA rupture, whereas open repair is associated with higher perioperative morbidity and mortality than EVAR but provides a more definitive repair. Perioperative mortality for elective open AAA repair is 3 to 5 percent, and for EVAR is 0.5 to 2 percent. Long-term mortality rates are not significantly different. (See <a href=\"#H783678\" class=\"local\">'Open versus endovascular aneurysm repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with guidelines from major medical and surgical societies that emphasize an individualized approach when choosing the approach to AAA repair, taking into account aortic anatomy, patient age, life expectancy, and risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality. For patients with favorable anatomy for endovascular repair (as defined by the instructions for use of a given device) and a high level of perioperative risk, we recommend endovascular repair, rather than open surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Endovascular repair may also be appropriate for patients with favorable anatomy but who do not have a high surgical risk. Young patients (&lt;60 years) who have a low or average perioperative risk and an expected lifespan &gt;10 years may elect open surgical repair rather than endovascular repair to limit lifelong exposure to radiation that might result from stent-graft surveillance after endovascular repair.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1010793733\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
