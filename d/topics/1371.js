In addition, ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis. Within 10 years after the diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis, approximately 58 percent of patients will have developed ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A careful history, physical examination, and abdominal paracentesis with appropriate ascitic fluid analysis can usually determine the cause of ascites formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Patients who have a cause for ascites formation other than cirrhosis may not respond to the treatments used in those with cirrhosis. This is particularly true for ascites due to peritoneal carcinomatosis, in which sodium restriction and diuretics cause intravascular volume depletion without mobilization of the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The diagnosis and evaluation of patients with ascites, the treatment of refractory ascites, and the management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are discussed elsewhere.

The discussion that follows is consistent with that guideline. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58084921\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy in patients with ascites are to minimize ascitic fluid volume and decrease peripheral edema, without causing intravascular volume depletion. Although there is no evidence that treatment of fluid overload in patients with cirrhosis improves survival, the following benefits have been noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients report that with less fluid they feel much better, have less abdominal discomfort, can move and eat more easily, and have less shortness of breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As fluid is removed, ascitic fluid opsonins become more concentrated, which may protect against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in the risk of cellulitis and of abdominal wall hernia formation or diaphragmatic rupture (and resulting hepatic hydrothorax) associated with tense ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced amount of energy expended heating the ascitic fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58085356\"><span class=\"h1\">THRESHOLD FOR INITIATING TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a patient with cirrhosis develops clinically apparent ascites, it is unlikely to resolve without specific treatment (eg, a sodium-restricted diet and diuretics). Three possible exceptions to this rule are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who have a huge dietary sodium intake and a large reversible component of liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop ascites for the first time in the setting of resuscitation for upper gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis</p><p/><p>In such patients, ascites may resolve following cessation of drinking and reduction of sodium intake, discontinuation of intravenous fluids, and treatment with antiviral therapy, respectively.</p><p>The natural history of small-volume ascitic fluid that is only apparent on imaging with no perceived swelling of the abdomen is unclear. Whether this volume of fluid may come and go without specific treatment is unknown. We only initiate therapy once the ascites is clinically apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of ascites in patients with cirrhosis includes abstinence from alcohol, restricting dietary sodium, and treating with diuretics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77152\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77152 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70375 \">table 1</a>). In addition to treatment with alcohol abstinence, sodium restriction, and diuretics, patients with tense ascites should undergo an initial large-volume therapeutic paracentesis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol abstinence'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dietary sodium restriction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58087077\" class=\"local\">'Large-volume paracentesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Alcohol abstinence is an important component of treatment because it dramatically improves ascites in some patients with alcohol-induced liver disease. Pharmacologic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> may improve alcohol abstinence. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Alcohol abstinence'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with ascites should be restricted to 88 mEq (2000 mg) of sodium per day. Since fluid follows sodium passively, fluid restriction is generally not required for the treatment of ascites, though it may be indicated in patients with ascites and a very low serum sodium (less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>). Sodium restriction alone (ie, without the addition of diuretics) will be sufficient treatment only in the small subset of patients whose urinary sodium excretion (in the absence of diuretics) is more than 78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (88 mEq intake minus 10 mEq of non-urinary losses). </p><p>Most patients with cirrhosis and ascites require both dietary sodium restriction and diuretics. When given the option of a more restrictive diet without diuretics or less restrictive diet with diuretics, most patients choose the latter. Our approach is to prescribe diuretics in combination with sodium restriction to all patients with cirrhosis and clinically detectable ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The diuretic doses can be tapered or temporarily discontinued if weight loss is rapid. Diuretic therapy typically consists of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> in a ratio of 100:40 mg per day, with doses titrated upward every three to five days as needed (up to 400 mg spironolactone and 160 mg furosemide per day). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Several medications should be avoided or used with caution in patients with ascites, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. In addition, consideration should be given to stopping or not initiating nonselective beta blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> in patients with refractory ascites, as they may shorten survival in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H58085190\" class=\"local\">'Medications to avoid or use with caution'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58085424\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of underlying liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, management of the underlying liver disease can treat reversible components of a patient's hepatic decompensation and lead to improvement or resolution of ascites. This can be seen in patients with cirrhosis due to alcohol-induced liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or chronic hepatitis B virus. By contrast, most other causes of cirrhosis are not reversible. It may be more appropriate to consider liver transplantation for definitive treatment of these diseases, rather than protracted medical therapy of ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol abstinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are actively consuming alcohol should be encouraged to abstain completely. Even if alcohol is not the only cause of their liver disease (eg, in patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C), the alcohol-related component of their liver disease may improve dramatically with abstinence. Alcoholism is commonly the driving force for mortality in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus who come to medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pharmacologic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> has been shown to improve abstinence in patients with alcoholic liver disease.</p><p>Among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, abstinence may lead to improvement of hepatic histology in some patients with marked fibrosis and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], a reduction in or even normalization of the portal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and disappearance of or easier to treat ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Perhaps the most common setting in which patients with refractory ascites revert back to diuretic-responsive ascites is alcoholic liver disease with total abstinence from alcohol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-alcoholic-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy for alcohol dependence may improve abstinence. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Baclofen</a> was shown in a randomized trial with patients with alcoholic liver disease to reduce alcohol craving and consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], though trials in other populations have had mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. We have had good results with the use of baclofen in patients with alcoholic liver disease, so our practice is to use baclofen to aid with abstinence, particularly in patients who have been admitted with alcoholic hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The starting dose is 5 mg three times per day for three days. The dose is then increased to 10 mg three times per day. The dose can be increased further as needed until the craving for alcohol is extinguished. We will use doses up to 95 mg daily in five divided doses. The pills can be carried by the patient and taken when the patient feels a craving for alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder&quot;, section on 'Baclofen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58085439\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of other liver diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis may have a reversible component with glucocorticoid therapy with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-hepatitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune hepatitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B can have dramatic improvement with effective antiviral treatment, and there is evidence that cirrhosis can reverse with successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58085190\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications to avoid or use with caution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with cirrhosis, lower arterial blood pressure is associated with lower survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], so medications that decrease blood pressure might decrease survival. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> may decrease survival in patients with refractory ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We stop or avoid initiating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs), and beta blockers in patients with progressive cirrhosis whose blood pressure is declining, and we do not use beta blockers in patients with refractory ascites. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs should be used only if the blood pressure is above goal. </p><p>Prostaglandin inhibitors, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), should also be avoided since they can reduce urinary sodium excretion and induce azotemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11163054\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoidance of angiotensin inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic blood pressure tends to progressively fall with increasing severity of cirrhosis, particularly in patients with decompensated liver disease. The progressive decrease in systemic blood pressure is associated with reductions in renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate and increases in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This leads to elevated serum levels of vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin, angiotensin, and aldosterone. These vasoconstrictors support the patients' blood pressure by compensating for the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Because arterial pressure is directly related to survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], we suggest that ACEIs and ARBs be avoided in patients with ascites, a position that is also supported by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>].</p><p>Occasional patients with cirrhosis also have proteinuric chronic kidney disease due to diabetes mellitus or other conditions. In patients who do not have cirrhosis, ACEIs and ARBs can slow the rate of progression of renal disease and are widely used. The goal blood pressure in such patients is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg. However, there are no clinical trials of angiotensin inhibition to slow the progression of chronic proteinuric kidney disease in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Furthermore, such patients often have systolic pressures below 100 mmHg and, due to the increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, are at risk for a marked reduction in blood pressure and worsening renal function with angiotensin inhibitor therapy. As a result, we typically do not use ACEIs and ARBs in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease who have decompensated cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If patients with ascites are started on an ACEI or an ARB, they must have their blood pressure and renal function monitored closely. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320627753\"><span class=\"h3\">Propranolol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> has been shown to prevent variceal hemorrhage in patients with large varices, studies suggest it may worsen survival in patients with refractory ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We have seen this drug reduce blood pressure in patients with ascites and make the fluid more diuretic-resistant. Patients with ascites who are started on a beta blocker should have their blood pressure and renal function monitored carefully. The risks versus benefits of beta blockers must be carefully weighed in each patient with advanced cirrhosis. In general, we do not use propranolol in patients with refractory ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-diuretic-resistant-ascites#H1323127682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Diuretic-resistant ascites&quot;, section on 'Discontinuing beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58085689\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoidance of NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general component of the therapy of patients with cirrhosis and ascites is avoidance of the use of NSAIDs. These agents inhibit the synthesis of renal prostaglandins, leading to renal vasoconstriction, a lesser response to diuretics, and the possible precipitation of acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. NSAIDs can also precipitate upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In motivated patients who receive appropriate education, this can be done without the purchase of special food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51602 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63387 \">table 2</a>).

Patients with cirrhosis whose urinary excretion of sodium is significantly less than dietary intake will accumulate sodium and water, eventually leading to ascites and perhaps peripheral edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Removal of ascites and edema requires the induction of negative sodium balance. In addition to cosmetic benefits and the possible relief of abdominal discomfort, fluid removal also may produce a modest reduction in portal pressure, presumably mediated by the reduction in plasma volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It may also decrease the risk of ascitic fluid infection by increasing ascitic fluid opsonic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As liver function deteriorates, urinary sodium excretion falls progressively and can approach zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/15,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28,29</a>]. In this setting, the induction of negative sodium balance requires the combination of sodium restriction and diuretics. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Education about the importance of dietary sodium restriction is a central component of the management of ascites. The patient and the cook (if the patient is not the cook) should meet with a dietician for an education session. In our experience, most patients do not receive this education session and are therefore much less likely to follow the diet. Those who understand and follow the diet usually do not require readmission for fluid overload; by comparison, noncompliant patients often require multiple hospitalizations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid restriction has traditionally been recommended in patients with cirrhosis and ascites who have hyponatremia. However, such an approach is not supported by the available data and will make an already thirsty patient more uncomfortable, just to correct an asymptomatic laboratory abnormality. We only limit fluid intake when the plasma sodium is less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which is an uncommon finding (1 percent in a multicenter review of 997 consecutive patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], or the patient has neurologic symptoms that might be due to hyponatremia.

Concerns with diuretic therapy include overly rapid removal of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.</p><p>Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy is effective in approximately 90 percent of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients who appear to be diuretic-resistant, it is important to exclude lack of adherence with dietary sodium restriction. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic resistance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58086645\"><span class=\"h3\">Diuretic regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most successful therapeutic regimen for cirrhotic ascites is the combination of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, beginning with 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, in small patients (patients who weigh approximately 50 kg or less) with a small volume of ascites, we use lower doses (eg, 50 mg of spironolactone and 20 mg of furosemide). If a clinical response is not evident after three to five days, or if the degree of weight loss is less than desired, the doses can be increased by 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively. This can be repeated if needed. The maximum recommended doses are spironolactone 400 mg per day and furosemide 160 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. </p><p>The long half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> makes single-daily dosing most appropriate. Giving both drugs once per day in the morning also maximizes adherence and minimizes nocturia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loop diuretics: Maximum effective dose and major side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important not to treat fluid overload from cirrhotic ascites with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, as is often done in patients with heart failure. With heart failure, clinicians may use intravenous furosemide if there is concern that oral furosemide is being poorly absorbed. However, this is not appropriate in patients with cirrhosis because oral furosemide is absorbed well in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In patients with cirrhosis, giving intravenous furosemide often causes an acute reduction in renal function that cannot be explained by the diuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and may lead to crescendo azotemia that may then masquerade as hepatorenal syndrome. We generally suggest that intravenous furosemide be avoided for the treatment of ascites unless there is no other option (eg, soft tissue or pulmonary edema in a patient taking nothing by mouth). However, a single dose of intravenous furosemide (80 mg) may help identify patients who are diuretic-resistant. Patients who are diuretic resistant will typically secrete &lt;50 mEq of urine sodium over eight hours following a dose of intravenous furosemide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>At least one randomized trial demonstrated that concomitant treatment with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> can mobilize moderate ascites more rapidly than sequential diuretics (ie, spironolactone alone followed by adding furosemide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, using a combination of spironolactone and furosemide in a ratio of 100:40 mg usually maintains normokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Single-agent spironolactone, especially at higher doses, regularly causes hyperkalemia in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The concomitant use of furosemide usually leads to better urine sodium excretion as well as normokalemia. However, patients with parenchymal renal disease or who have undergone liver transplantation may require lower doses of spironolactone to prevent hyperkalemia. In such patients, we use a ratio of spironolactone to furosemide that is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">100/40</span> (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">100/80</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">100/120)</span>. It is a matter of trial and error to achieve natriuresis without hyperkalemia. In some cases, we cannot use any spironolactone, especially when the glomerular filtration rate is very low or the patient develops hyperkalemia.</p><p>The only setting in which we begin with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> monotherapy is in patients with profound hypokalemia (most often seen in the setting of severe alcoholic hepatitis). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Furosemide</a> is added once the potassium normalizes and potassium replacement is no longer needed. </p><p>Increasingly, older adults are being diagnosed with cirrhosis and ascites, including patients &gt;90 years of age. These patients have silently sustained a decrease in glomerular filtration rate with aging and are intolerant of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>. The usual starting doses of diuretics in these patients are 25 mg of spironolactone with 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> orally daily. If that is not enough, 50 mg of spironolactone with 40 mg of furosemide daily can be given. The risks of higher doses must be weighed against the benefits. Older patients are more prone to falls than younger patients. It is preferable to tolerate a little fluid overload in these fragile patients rather than pushing to euvolemia or hypovolemia. It has been said, &quot;Better wet and wise than dry and demented&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This recommendation is even more relevant in older adults. </p><p>It is important to avoid hypokalemia in patients with cirrhosis and ascites because potassium depletion can enhance renal ammonia production and possibly precipitate hepatic coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A transcellular cation exchange, in which potassium moves out of cells (to partially replete extracellular potassium stores) in exchange for hydrogen, is thought to be responsible for this effect, since the ensuing intracellular acidosis stimulates ammonia synthesis in the proximal tubular cells, which can contribute to hyperammonemia. Our goal is to maintain the plasma potassium concentration above 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> but below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemia-induced-renal-dysfunction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemia-induced renal dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Increased ammonia production'</a>.)</p><p>Interestingly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> (an aldosterone antagonist) alone is more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> alone in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/31,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,38</a>]. The surprising finding that a normally weak diuretic may be more effective than a loop diuretic in cirrhotic ascites may be related to differences in the mechanism of drug action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Loop and thiazide diuretics must enter the tubular lumen to be effective. Most of these drugs are highly protein-bound; as a result, they enter the tubular lumen by secretion in the proximal tubule, not by glomerular filtration. This secretory process appears to be impaired in cirrhosis, perhaps due to competitive or toxic inhibition by retained compounds such as bile salts. The net effect is that diuretic entry into the lumen, and therefore the natriuretic effect, may be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Spironolactone</a> is occasionally associated with painful gynecomastia. As a result, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> (10 to 40 mg per day), another potassium-sparing diuretic that directly closes the aldosterone-sensitive luminal sodium channels in the collecting tubules, has also been used in the treatment of ascites. However, amiloride appears be less effective than spironolactone in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Patients who are forewarned about the risk of gynecomastia are usually willing to continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> despite its occurrence. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Eplerenone</a> is a newer, highly selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In contrast to spironolactone, eplerenone is not associated with an increased risk of gynecomastia and has been associated with resolution of gynecomastia after discontinuing spironolactone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, it is far more expensive than spironolactone, and no study has compared the efficacy of spironolactone with that of eplerenone in patients with ascites. In our experience, eplerenone seems to be less effective than spironolactone in the treatment of ascites.

When a diuresis is induced, the fluid is initially lost from the vascular space; the ensuing fall in intravascular pressure allows the edema fluid to be mobilized to replete the plasma volume. Fluid mobilization can be rapid (in some cases, exceeding 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/day</span> without detectable intravascular volume depletion) in patients with peripheral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>By comparison, patients who only have ascites without edema can mobilize ascitic fluid solely via the peritoneum. The maximum rate at which this can occur is only 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day;</span> more rapid fluid removal with diuretics (weight loss &gt;0.75 kg per day) can lead to plasma volume depletion and azotemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. If more rapid fluid removal is required, an initial large-volume paracentesis should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H58087077\" class=\"local\">'Large-volume paracentesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58087291\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important concepts in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites is feedback for the clinician. When a decision is made to start or to alter the treatment regimen, the clinician needs to know if the decision was a good one. Patients must be reevaluated frequently with daily weights in the hospital or at home.</p><p>For patients who are admitted to the hospital for the treatment of ascites, the first clinic visit should be one to two weeks following discharge. A study in heart failure showed that a seven-day clinic return helped prevent readmission within 30 days of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Patients sent home with a remote appointment are regularly readmitted with worsening fluid overload, overdiuresis, or electrolyte imbalances before they are due back in the clinic. If distant travel is a problem, &quot;telephone medicine&quot; can permit adjustment of diuretic doses based upon weights, faxed laboratory results, and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Patients with a component of alcohol injury to their liver disease may become less sodium avid with abstinence and healing of the reversible component of their liver injury. Some may be able to be tapered off diuretics, and some revert from diuretic resistance to diuretic sensitivity. Clues that the patient may no longer need diuretics include orthostatic symptoms, azotemia, and the absence of ascites and edema. Once patients lose their sodium avidity, we begin tapering the diuretics, reducing to a final dose of 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> plus 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> before discontinuing altogether.</p><p>Diuretics should be stopped if patients develop uncontrolled or recurrent encephalopathy, a serum sodium less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> despite fluid restriction (such patients typically have very low urine sodium output and pre-hepatorenal syndrome), or a serum creatinine greater than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (180 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. These patients may need alternative therapies, such as serial paracenteses. In patients with poor renal perfusion, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> may allow for the reinstitution of diuretics.

However, in patients with no reversible component to their liver injury, the ascites usually worsens over time and progresses from being diuretic-sensitive to being diuretic-resistant. In patients who appear to be diuretic-resistant, it is important to exclude lack of adherence with dietary sodium restriction. This is done by testing urinary sodium excretion. Patients who are diuretic-resistant will have inadequate excretion, whereas those who are not adherent to the sodium restriction will gain weight despite what would otherwise be adequate excretion.

Starting doses of diuretics in these patients are 25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> with 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> orally daily. If that is not enough, 50 mg of spironolactone with 40 mg of furosemide daily can be given.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> be avoided unless there is no other option (eg, soft tissue or pulmonary edema in a patient taking nothing by mouth) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Oral furosemide is absorbed well in the setting of cirrhosis, and intravenous furosemide may cause an acute reduction in renal function and can lead to crescendo azotemia that may then masquerade as hepatorenal syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision is made to start or to alter the treatment regimen, the clinician needs to know if the decision was a good one. Patients must be reevaluated frequently with daily weights in the hospital or at home. For patients who are admitted to the hospital for the treatment of ascites, the first clinic visit should be one to two weeks following discharge. (See <a href=\"#H58087291\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy is effective in approximately 90 percent of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In patients who appear to be diuretic-resistant, it is important to exclude lack of adherence with dietary sodium restriction. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Runyon BA, Montano AA, Akriviadis EA, et al.
