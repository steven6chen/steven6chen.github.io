An Italian study of 136 consecutive cases of IgM MGUS identified a MYD88 (L265P) mutation at the time of diagnosis in 71 cases (52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After a median follow-up of 34 months, nine developed WM and two developed marginal zone lymphoma. Of these 11 patients with progression, nine (82 percent) had the MYD88 (L265P) mutation at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that presence of the MYD88 (L265P) mutation was associated with a higher rate of progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391027\"><span class=\"h3\">Light chain MGUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Light chain MGUS (LC-MGUS) is defined by the presence of an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65), increased level of the involved free light chain above the reference range, no monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgM), bone marrow with &lt;10 percent monoclonal plasma cells, if done, and absence of end organ damage (lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency) related to the proliferative process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].

For this reason, the median survival of patients with MGUS is expected to be only slightly shorter than that of age-matched controls. However, persons with MGUS may have other diagnoses that led to the identification of the monoclonal protein and may impact survival.</p><p>Studies that have investigated the survival of patients with MGUS have had mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 1384 persons with MGUS followed for a median of 34 years, the median survival was shorter than that of a comparable United States population (8.1 versus 12.4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Sweden indicated that patients with MGUS have a significantly reduced life expectancy when compared with the general population, and an excess risk of dying not only from well-described malignant transformations (eg, multiple myeloma, Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis), but also from bacterial infections as well as heart, liver, and renal diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It is paramount to deliver the appropriate balance of information about this asymptomatic disorder that has a small chance of progression to a more serious disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients and their families need appropriate information and support concerning the clinical and psychological ramifications of a diagnosis of MGUS.</p><p>Patients with MGUS should be monitored for disease progression and for potential complications. Not all persons with MGUS have the same risk of disease progression. The risk of progression to a serious disease ranges widely from 0.6 to 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span> according to the initial value of serum monoclonal protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/9,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29-31</a>], or from 0.25 to 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span> according to a risk stratification model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. There are a variety of acceptable monitoring schedules for patients with MGUS. Our approach uses a risk stratification system to provide more intensive monitoring for patients more likely to progress.</p><p>There is no known role for chemotherapy in the management of MGUS. Only a minority of patients will progress to symptomatic disease and there is no data that treatment of asymptomatic disease effects mortality. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if the early use of drugs and other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, bisphosphonates) can delay the progression of MGUS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> smoldering multiple myeloma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22391048\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, patients with MGUS progress to a symptomatic plasma cell proliferative disorder or lymphoproliferative disorder at a rate of 1 percent per year. No single factor can differentiate a patient with MGUS who will have a benign clinical course from one in whom a malignant plasma cell or lymphoproliferative disorder will eventually develop. Numerous studies have investigated potential predictors of disease progression. Of these, three adverse risk factors have been combined to create a risk-stratification model that is useful in predicting the risk of progression of MGUS (non-IgM and IgM) to MM or a related malignancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum monoclonal protein level &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/9,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29-31</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-IgG MGUS (ie, IgA, IgM, IgD MGUS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal serum free light chain ratio (ie, ratio of kappa to lambda free light chains &lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>]</p><p/><p>The absolute risk of disease progression over 20 years for patients with various combinations of risk factors is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 risk factors (high-risk MGUS) &ndash; 58 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 risk factors (high-intermediate risk MGUS) &ndash; 37 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 risk factor (low-intermediate risk MGUS) &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No risk factors (low-risk MGUS) &ndash; 5 percent</p><p/><p>Other studies support the use of these factors as predictors of progression.

This analysis confirmed an incremental increase in the likelihood of progression with each of the three factors described above.

As a result, patients should be advised to obtain medical evaluation promptly if clinical symptoms occur. This risk stratified follow-up places a high value on minimizing undue psychological and financial stress on patients unlikely to progress and places a low value on the unknown benefit of the small chance of detecting disease progression early through laboratory testing.</p><p>The efficacy of periodic monitoring was evaluated in a single-institution retrospective analysis of 116 patients with MGUS who later developed MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Patients evaluated at least every two years were considered to have optimal follow-up. Of the 80 patients with optimal follow-up, disease progression was identified by routine laboratory follow-up in only 13 patients (16 percent). Disease progression to symptomatic MM was identified in the rest of the cases by: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious MM-related complications (45 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic work-up of less serious symptoms reported by the patient (25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incidental finding in the context of workup of another condition (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown (3 percent)</p><p/><p>In patients with high-risk MGUS (serum M protein &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-IgG MGUS), disease progression was identified by routine laboratory follow-up in 21 percent. This study suggests that close follow-up of the general population of patients with MGUS may not achieve its purpose of identifying the progression to MM prior to an adverse MM-related complication. It also demonstrates that most patients who progress to MM will have symptoms that prompt further investigation. However, patients with high-risk MGUS have a higher rate of transformation and a greater chance of having progression identified by routine periodic testing before a serious MM-related complication occurs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3221507\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3221515\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MGUS have an increased risk of axial (skull, <span class=\"nowrap\">vertebral/pelvis,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">sternum/costae),</span> but not peripheral (arm and leg), bone fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>], with the highest risk being noted in those with reduced lumbar bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Patients with MGUS had an increased risk of fracture at five years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.74, 95% CI 1.58-1.92) and 10 years (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.74). This increased risk was greatest for axial fractures. The risk of fracture did not differ by isotype (ie, IgG versus IgA) or M protein concentration at diagnosis. Fracture did not predict for disease progression to multiple myeloma or Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia. &#160;</p><p>Patients with MGUS should be evaluated for osteoporosis and osteopenia with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and have their vitamin D and calcium intake optimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Prophylactic bisphosphonates have not been proven to be beneficial for patients with MGUS. Bisphosphonates should be used in these patients only if they have another indication for their use, such as osteoporosis or osteopenia on bone mineral density studies.

We recommend that patients with MGUS be encouraged to participate in age-appropriate cancer screening programs. No additional cancer screening has been recommended for this population.</p><p>In a large series, persons with MGUS were reported to have excessive rates of acute myeloid <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/myelodysplastic</span> syndrome (SIR 8.01; 95% CI 5.40-11.43) and nonhematologic malignancy (SIR 1.56; 95% CI 1.44-1.68) when compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, the general population in this study was not screened for the presence or absence of MGUS. The association seen is likely inflated; patients who are ill enough to be evaluated for MGUS are likely to have more medical problems and cancers than patients who never have the need for such a test. These study flaws are systematic biases, and therefore cannot be rectified and are likely to be amplified by large sample sizes. In asymptomatic conditions such as MGUS, true associations can be demonstrated only if all persons are tested uniformly for the presence or absence of the condition.</p><p>A subsequent population-based study evaluated the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 17,315 persons aged 50 and older screened for MGUS and followed for a mean of 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Of the 605 persons with MGUS, seven were subsequently diagnosed with MDS and two were diagnosed with AML. When compared with those without MGUS, persons with MGUS demonstrated a slightly higher risk of developing MDS (relative risk [RR] 2.40; 95% CI 1.08-5.32) and a trend towards an increased risk of developing AML (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.32-5.74), which did not reach statistical significance. There was no increase in the risk of developing ALL. Unlike the Swedish study, this was a study in which all patients were screened for the presence or absence of MGUS, and thereby did not have the problem of ascertainment bias. This study shows that the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">AML/MDS</span> with MGUS is much lower than that estimated in the Swedish study. </p><p>These studies suggest that patients with MGUS may have a slightly higher risk of developing MDS. There does not appear to be any excess risk of ALL, and data are limited to determine if there is any increase in the risk of AML. AML has a low incidence in the general population; as a result, an increase in the relative risk in patients with MGUS does not translate into a high likelihood of developing AML. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3233798098\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

MGUS occurs in over 3 percent of the general population over the age of 50 and is typically detected as an incidental finding when patients undergo a protein electrophoresis as part of an evaluation for a wide variety of clinical symptoms and disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three distinct clinical types of MGUS, each with a risk of progressing through a unique intermediate (more advanced) premalignant stage and then to a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder (see <a href=\"#H22391006\" class=\"local\">'Disease progression'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Non-IgM MGUS (IgG, IgA, or IgD MGUS) is the most common subtype of MGUS. It has the potential to progress to smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma and symptomatic multiple myeloma. Less frequently, these patients progress to AL amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease, or another lymphoproliferative disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IgM MGUS accounts for approximately 15 percent of MGUS cases. It is considered separately from non-IgM MGUS because it has the potential to progress to smoldering Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia and symptomatic Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rarely, IgM MGUS can progress to IgM multiple myeloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Light chain MGUS is a unique subtype of MGUS in which the secreted monoclonal protein lacks the immunoglobulin heavy chain component. It may progress to idiopathic Bence Jones proteinuria, light chain multiple myeloma, or AL amyloidosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MGUS progress to more advanced disease at a rate of 1 percent per year. When compared with non-IgM MGUS, the rate may be slightly higher for IgM MGUS and slightly lower for light chain MGUS. (See <a href=\"#H22391006\" class=\"local\">'Disease progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median survival of patients with MGUS is only slightly shorter than that of age-matched controls. (See <a href=\"#H22391034\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No treatment is required for patients with MGUS. Patients with MGUS should be followed over time with history and physical examination looking for signs and symptoms of progressive disease. All patients should undergo laboratory evaluation for disease progression six months after diagnosis with serum and urinary M-protein, complete blood count, creatinine, and serum calcium. While some experts incorporate periodic laboratory testing into the routine follow-up of all patients, we use a risk stratification system to identify patients for whom laboratory testing is most likely to provide value:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with low-risk non-IgM MGUS (serum M protein &le;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> IgG subtype, and normal serum free light chain ratio) may be followed with history and physical examination alone.

As a result, patients should be advised to obtain medical evaluation promptly if clinical symptoms occur.

Patients with MGUS should be evaluated for osteoporosis with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and have their vitamin D and calcium intake optimized. If osteoporosis is present, then treatment with bisphosphonates may be considered at the same dosing and schedule used for osteoporosis in patients without MGUS.
