It is a gradual, multistep, interdisciplinary effort involving the surgeon(s), anesthesiologist(s), perfusionist(s), and operating room nurse(s). This topic will discuss the process of weaning from CPB after completion of the cardiac surgical procedure.</p><p>Intraoperative problems are commonly encountered in the immediate postbypass period; these are discussed separately.

Either a volatile anesthetic administered via a vaporizer attached to the CPB circuit or a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is typically used to maintain anesthesia during CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H3593640145\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade'</a>.) Subsequently, during weaning from CPB, either volatile anesthetic administration is reinstituted via the anesthesia machine, or the TIVA technique is continued. Additional monitoring such as bispectral index (BIS) may be useful to guide titration of inhaled <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous (IV) anesthetics during weaning and the postbypass period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>djuvant drugs &ndash; Prepare adjuvant drugs. Drugs likely to be used during weaning from CPB, such as antiarrhythmic agents, inotropic drugs, and vasoactive infusions, should be prepared and immediately available to avoid distractions during weaning. Protamine for heparin neutralization is often prepared for administration after weaning, but it must be secured away from the surgical field until it is needed to avoid unintentional administration during ongoing CPB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>ir &ndash; Air in the cardiac chambers is removed by the surgeon (see <a href=\"#H2762217\" class=\"local\">'Surgeon's preparation'</a> below), aided by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) monitoring and close communication with the anesthesiologist to assess adequacy of air removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Air may accumulate in the aortic root, left ventricle (LV), and left atrium (LA) during surgery, particularly if the left heart chambers have been opened, and may embolize to the systemic circulation after removal of the aortic cross-clamp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114097%7EANEST%2F114100%7EANEST%2F114098%7EANEST%2F114099\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114097 graphicRef114100 graphicRef114098 graphicRef114099 \">movie 1A-D</a>). When the lungs are reinflated and mechanical ventilation is reestablished, pulmonary venous blood is displaced into the LA, along with any air bubbles trapped in the pulmonary veins. Embolization to the coronary arteries may cause myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and ventricular dysfunction, while embolization to the cerebral circulation may cause neurologic dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The goal of de-airing procedures is to reduce cerebral and systemic air embolization as much as possible. The anesthesiologist typically places the patient into the Trendelenburg position during the de-airing process, since this may reduce the quantity of air entering the cerebral circulation. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>hythm &ndash; Reestablish an adequate perfusing heart rhythm before weaning. Normal sinus rhythm is ideal, but temporary epicardial pacing is employed if sinus rhythm cannot be achieved or to treat bradycardia. When atrioventricular (AV) conduction is normal, atrial (A) pacing is used. Otherwise, AV pacing is preferable to ventricular (V) pacing so that AV synchrony and optimal ventricular preloading are maintained (see <a href=\"#H1116788115\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of optimal pacemaker function'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>ate &ndash; A heart rate between 80 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (bpm) is optimal to maximize cardiac output without sacrificing coronary diastolic perfusion time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>esistance &ndash; Vasodilation with hypotension in patients with a normal or elevated cardiac output (pump flow rate) indicates low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and a need for vasopressors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>).

Respiratory problems that become evident with reestablishment of ventilation (eg, bronchospasm or high airway pressure) should be addressed prior to weaning from bypass.

Decisions to transfuse depend on reservoir volume and red blood cell (RBC) mass (see <a href=\"#H375331664\" class=\"local\">'Perfusionist's preparation'</a> below). Check for electrolyte (eg, potassium, calcium) or acid&ndash;base abnormalities with core lab or point-of-care testing, and treat as needed. Ionized calcium levels should be 1.09 to 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> and potassium levels should be 4 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> to allow normal myocardial function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>M</strong>onitoring &ndash; Ensure that all monitors are functioning.

All team members must be present in the operating room and focused on their roles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgeon and anesthesiologist direct the perfusionist to gradually decrease the amount of blood diverted to the CPB circuit, which allows some blood to remain in the right atrium (RA). This process is evident on the monitor because pulsatility on the arterial blood pressure (BP) tracing is restored, and a gradual increase is noted in the central venous pressure (CVP) (and pulmonary artery pressure [PAP], if available) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114603\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef114603 \">waveform 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perfusionist continues to infuse blood through the aortic cannula, thereby restoring the circulating blood volume as venous drainage is further reduced. Once the left ventricle (LV) is adequately filled and is ejecting a sufficient stroke volume (as evidenced by the pulse pressure on the arterial pressure waveform), the perfusionist stops diverting blood from the RA to the CPB circuit, clamps the venous drainage line completely, and communicates that the patient is now &quot;off bypass&quot; (ie, weaned from bypass).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anesthesiologist and surgeon continuously assess adequacy of ventricular filling (preload) by observing the LV and right ventricle (RV) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The RV is also assessed by direct visualization in the open chest.

Although CVP may be monitored, the optimal target to ensure adequate filling depends on the patient's baseline CVP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CI of 2.0 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup>, indicating adequate organ perfusion (assuming adequate oxygen carrying capacity of the blood).</p><p/><p>Although these goals may be achieved, unstable physiologic parameters and inadequate organ perfusion may subsequently occur in the immediate postbypass period due to inadequate preload (most commonly resulting from bleeding), inadequate vascular tone (ie, vasodilation), or myocardial dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2233261151\"><span class=\"h1\">THE IMMEDIATE POSTBYPASS PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goals during the immediate postbypass period are to reverse anticoagulation, achieve hemostasis, reinfuse residual pump blood, maintain an optimal hemodynamic state, complete the surgical procedure, and prepare for patient transport to the intensive care unit (ICU) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108173 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H307376349\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous decannulation and initial return of pump blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After complete separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), with no venous return <strong>to</strong> the pump (or arterial outflow <strong>from</strong> the pump), the surgeon removes the venous cannula and closes the right atrial (RA) cannulation site. Blood remaining in the venous tubing is returned to the venous reservoir for transfusion back into the patient by the perfusionist. This is typically accomplished by administering small aliquots of 100 to 200 mL through the aortic cannula as directed by the anesthesiologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgeon to augment cardiac index (CI) as needed. </p><p>When ventricular filling is adequate and there is no anticipated need for returning to CPB, the surgeon removes the aortic cannula and repairs this cannulation site. Any residual blood remaining in the extracorporeal circuit reservoir is returned to the patient via a peripheral intravenous (IV) or central venous catheter (CVC), as described below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3862454238\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversal of anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutralization of systemic heparin with protamine is typically completed, or at least initiated, before aortic decannulation. This timing allows rapid reinstitution of CPB in the event of a catastrophic protamine reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>We administer an initial &ldquo;test dose&rdquo; of protamine, 20 to 30 mg, to allow early detection of serious hemodynamic changes indicative of a protamine reaction. If there is no adverse reaction, the remainder of the protamine dose is administered slowly, typically over a 5 to 15 minute period, preferably by infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Slower infusion may avoid potential vasodilation. (See <a href=\"#H1158269508\" class=\"local\">'Management of protamine reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>In some patients who received large doses of heparin due to altered heparin responsiveness, release into the intravascular space may occur after termination of CPB and metabolism of the protamine that was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. &ldquo;Heparin rebound&rdquo; may be related to nonspecific binding of heparin to plasma proteins as well as accumulation in fatty tissues due to its lipophilicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This may be counteracted by administering additional low doses of protamine (eg, as an infusion at approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> over two to four postoperative hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

It is hypothesized that neutralization of heparin in the blood remaining in the CPB reservoir may cause clot formation, which would prohibit emergency reinstitution of CPB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158269508\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of protamine reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanisms responsible for protamine reactions include potential vasodilation due to direct and indirect effects of protamine and potential complement activation by heparin-protamine complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/17,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,25</a>]. Such reactions are common, associated with a faster rate of protamine infusion, and treatable by administration of vasopressors as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A less common but more severe anaphylactic reaction with vasoplegia may occur in individuals who have antibodies to protamine due to previous exposure (eg, protamine-containing insulin) or due to allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/17,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24-27</a>]. In such cases, cardiovascular collapse unrelated to the rate of administration may occur. These reactions are treated in the same manner as other perioperative anaphylactic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute pulmonary vasoconstriction can also occur and may be accompanied by bronchospasm or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to thromboxane release from neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/17,24,25,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,25,27-30</a>]. Such severe reactions are likely caused by either IgG antibodies or heparin-protamine complexes. The differential diagnosis includes blood product administration causing transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), which can produce a similar reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Treatment consists of stopping protamine and may require reheparinization to allow immediate reinstitution of CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In some cases, noncardiac pulmonary edema is severe, and temporary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be necessary until edema resolves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19600491\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic decannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aortic cannula is removed by the surgeon during protamine neutralization of heparin. In general, protamine administration is initiated as described above, and if there is no evidence of an adverse protamine reaction, aortic decannulation proceeds. The aortic cannula should be removed before heparin neutralization is complete, so that clot does not form on the aortic cannula tip, which might lead to arterial thromboembolism. </p><p>Systolic BP is controlled (typically &lt;100 mmHg) during aortic decannulation to reduce risks of bleeding, aortic dissection, or other vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Methods to reduce BP include decreasing preload or afterload, or, rarely, altering temporary pacemaker settings. For example, preload may be decreased with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> administration, afterload may be decreased by administering anesthetic agents with vasodilatory properties (eg, small bolus doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 10 to 50 mg or increased concentration of an inhalation agent), or vasodilator agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clevidipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clevidipine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>. Also, temporary pacemaker settings may be temporarily adjusted (eg, a change from atrial or atrioventricular [AV] sequential pacing to ventricular pacing alone to reduce left ventricular [LV] filling and BP with loss of AV synchrony [atrial kick]). &#160;</p><p>The anesthesiologist closely controls systolic BP until the surgeon closes the decannulation site with aortic purse string sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1081331789\"><span class=\"h2\">Return of residual pump blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, 500 to 1500 mL of residual heparinized whole blood remains in the venous reservoir and tubing of the CPB pump after removal of the venous and aortic cannulae. This whole blood has not been further processed; therefore, it contains all of the clotting factors and platelets that are helpful for restoring hemostasis after reinfusion. However, residual pump blood also contains heparin. There are several methods to safely reinfuse this pump blood into the patient, and to neutralize any residual heparin (if necessary): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual pump blood may be hemoconcentrated by the perfusionist using the CPB circuit and then infused into the patient over a brief period (typically 10 to 15 minutes) via a primed intravenous tubing leading from the circuit that is connected by the anesthesiologist into an existing peripheral IV catheter or CVC port. Such direct reinfusion allows rapid delivery of the blood, including platelets and clotting factors. However, residual heparin in the residual pump blood must be neutralized with administration of protamine timed to coincide with completion of reinfusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If it is necessary to reinfuse blood slowly (eg, to avoid hypervolemia), an additional small dose of protamine (eg, 25 to 50 mg) is typically administered after the infusion is complete because protamine has a short half-life and will have been rapidly cleared after the initial dose. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative method is collection of residual pump blood into a separate blood transfusion bag, thereby allowing reinfusion later in the postbypass period. If this method is selected, residual heparin contained in the pump blood is neutralized by administering an additional small dose of protamine (eg, 25 to 50 mg) or a protamine infusion at approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> over two to four postoperative hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another method used by many centers is processing residual reservoir blood and any additional blood that is subsequently suctioned from the surgical field with a blood salvage device such as a &ldquo;cell saver&rdquo;. Since salvaged blood is concentrated and washed by cell saver devices, there is minimal residual heparin concentration. Thus, additional protamine administration is not necessary. However, platelets and other clotting factors are removed during cell saver processing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage#H5847575\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;, section on 'Technology and procedural steps'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1116788115\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of optimal pacemaker function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary epicardial pacing is usually employed after cardiac surgery with CPB via atrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wires placed by the surgeon before weaning from CPB (see <a href=\"#H23896552\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for weaning'</a> above). </p><p>Temporary epicardial A pacing is preferred to treat sinus bradycardia because this option provides an atrial kick and anterograde conduction through the His Bundle, resulting in coordinated ventricular contraction. However, since the AV delay may be prolonged after cardiac surgery, optimal pacing is achieved in some patients with AV sequential pacing to improve mechanical coupling between atria and ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>The following general principles for temporary pacemaker management apply to patients during weaning and the immediate postbypass period:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to separation from CPB, a regular rhythm with a rate of 80 to 90 beats per minute allows adequate diastolic filling time to optimize CI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For bradycardia, AOO, DOO, or VOO pacing is used to allow asynchronous pacing that will not be interrupted by oversensing of the surgical electrocautery.&nbsp;In these modes, the atrium, ventricle, or both are paced as necessary, but the pacemaker has no sensing response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'AOO, VOO, or DOO mode'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the patient&rsquo;s intrinsic heart rate (HR) is adequate (ie &gt;75), a synchronous pacemaker mode (DDD, AAI) may be employed. Such synchronous modes avoid the potential for pacing competition and R on T phenomena. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'DDD or DDDR pacing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'AAI or AAIR pacing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, surgical electrocautery causes electromechanical interference (EMI), with resultant atrial and ventricular oversensing and inhibition of pacing function. Also, the radiofrequency identification detection (RFID) wand used to detect retained surgical sponges near the end of the procedure may cause EMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, before applying a DDD or AAI pacemaker setting, the anesthesiologist must confirm that the patient has an underlying perfusing rhythm and adequate HR. This is done by pausing the pacemaker output, checking the ECG, and confirming appropriate ventricular ejection by inspecting the arterial BP tracing on the monitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator#H1817455467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;, section on 'Electromagnetic interference'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The temporary epicardial pacemaker should be set to a synchronous (sensing) mode for all patients before transport to the intensive care unit. Inappropriate asynchronous pacing may cause competition between the pacemaker and the patient&rsquo;s intrinsic rhythm, or more importantly, a rare but life threatening &quot;R-on-T&quot; phenomenon that results in ventricular fibrillation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3989184900\"><span class=\"h2\">Achievement of hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After decannulation and placement of pacemaker wires, the surgeon inspects all surgical sites for bleeding or compromise of the surgical repair.

In one large study, failure to wean from CPB on the first attempt or a requirement for mechanical assist devices to achieve weaning occurred in 14.5 percent of 6120 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Factors associated with failure to wean included older age, left ventricular dysfunction, previous cardiac surgery, presence of mitral valve regurgitation, coagulopathy, and longer duration of CPB.</p><p>Appropriate planning and communication are necessary during management of postbypass low CO syndrome (ie, cardiogenic shock). The anesthesiologist prepares additional vasoactive drugs and performs ongoing assessment of the need for mechanical circulatory support such as an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), ventricular assist device (VAD), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/weaning-from-cardiopulmonary-bypass/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2762259\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to CPB after a failed weaning attempt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of unsuccessful weaning from CPB are usually multifactorial, as one problem compounds others. For example, it may not be possible to sustain satisfactory blood pressure (BP) and myocardial perfusion in a hypotensive patient when adequate preload cannot be maintained due to excessive bleeding. </p><p>Urgent reinstitution of CPB may become necessary if blood pressure (BP), CO, and organ perfusion are inadequate. </p><p>Return to CPB involves several steps that must occur in rapid sequence, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perfusionist prepares the CPB machine and circuit. In general, these CPB components should remain primed (ie, filled with the patient's blood) until it is certain that the patient is stable and will not need to return to CPB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If protamine has been administered, the anesthesiologist must re-administer heparin before reinstitution of CPB. As with initial systemic heparinization, a dose of 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> is given; alternatively, the heparin dose may be determined by point-of-care testing (ie, HepCon) if available. It may be necessary to administer additional heparin to offset the effect of any residual protamine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation#H1260711682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Preparations and initiation&quot;, section on 'Heparin administration and monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once CPB has been reinstituted, the surgeon corrects any underlying technical problems. Often, surgical issues are addressed with the heart still beating. In some cases (eg, bleeding from an incision site or inadequate flow through a graft), replacement of the aortic cross-clamp and a repeated dose of cardioplegia are necessary to achieve electromechanical silence to facilitate adequate surgical repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a specific surgical problem is not identified, the patient is assessed for other cardiac and noncardiac problems before further attempts to wean from CPB.

This ensures that the patient is adequately rewarmed; blood gases, electrolytes, and hemoglobin are checked; and ventilation is reestablished. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is employed before weaning to assess residual intracardiac air, during weaning to assess adequacy of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling and function, and after weaning to perform a complete TEE assessment of the surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H23896552\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for weaning'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic goals during the weaning process are targeted to achieve stable physiologic parameters and adequate organ perfusion. Typical goals include heart rate 80 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (which may require pacing of the atrium, ventricle, or both), mean arterial pressure 60 to 90 mmHg, and adequate filling of the ventricles to achieve a cardiac index 2.0 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup>.
