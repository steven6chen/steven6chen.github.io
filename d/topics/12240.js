Osteosarcomas are uncommon tumors. Approximately 750 to 900 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which 400 arise in children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Despite their rarity, osteosarcomas are the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67051\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67051 \">figure 1</a>), and the fifth most common malignancy among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The survival of patients with malignant bone sarcomas has improved dramatically with effective chemotherapy. Prior to the use of chemotherapy, 80 to 90 percent of patients with osteosarcoma developed metastatic disease despite achieving local tumor control and died of their disease. It was surmised (and subsequently demonstrated) that the majority of patients had subclinical metastatic disease that was present at the time of diagnosis, even in the absence of overt clinical metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy can successfully eradicate these deposits if initiated at a time when disease burden is low. As a result, all patients with osteosarcoma (with the exception of patients with low-grade parosteal osteosarcomas and some patients with periosteal osteosarcoma where the value of chemotherapy has been questioned) are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and most receive some neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the preoperative period. With multimodality therapy, at least two-thirds of patients with non-metastatic extremity osteosarcomas will be long-term survivors, up to 50 percent of those with limited pulmonary metastases may be cured of their disease, and long-term relapse-free survival can be expected in approximately 25 percent of all patients who present with more extensive metastatic disease.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, staging, and histopathology of patients with osteosarcoma.

However, osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor affecting children and young adults. Osteosarcomas comprise 56 percent of all bone cancers in individuals under the age of 20, while Ewing sarcoma accounts for 34 to 36 percent, and chondrosarcomas are responsible for less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In contrast, in Asia, Paget's disease is less frequent, and a higher percentage of osteosarcomas in patients over the age of 40 arise primarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Osteosarcomas arising in the setting of Paget's disease (Pagetic sarcomas) have a worse prognosis overall. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Compared with cases diagnosed in children, osteosarcomas arising in adults more commonly occur in axial locations (although as in children, the lower extremity bones are the single most common site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]), and in areas that have been previously irradiated or that have underlying bone abnormalities. Age at diagnosis over 60 is also associated with a higher risk of metastatic disease at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>As is seen in children, among older adults, males are affected more often than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Early estimates suggested that approximately 3 percent of osteosarcomas could be attributed to prior irradiation. However, a higher incidence is likely to be revealed, as more patients survive long enough after primary irradiation to develop this complication. The interval between irradiation and the appearance of a secondary osteosarcoma averages 12 to 16 years; it is shorter in childhood cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-associated-sarcomas#H110695228\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-associated sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and histologic distribution'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-associated-sarcomas#H709392528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-associated sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Radiation dose and age of exposure'</a>.)</p><p>Prior exposure to chemotherapy, particularly alkylating agents, is also associated with secondary osteosarcomas in childhood cancer survivors and may potentiate the effect of previous radiation.

Although the incidence of bone tumors is markedly increased in patients with Paget disease, they only occur in 0.7 to 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Sarcomatous transformation is most often seen in long-standing Paget disease, but is not necessarily related to the extent of skeletal involvement. Although histologically indistinguishable from other osteosarcomas, multiple bone involvement is common, and the prognosis is poor overall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paget-disease-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The etiology of Paget disease is unclear, but genetic factors are thought to play a pathogenetic role. Both Paget disease and pagetic osteosarcomas are associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 18, possibly involving the same site of a postulated tumor suppressor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Somatic mutations in the <em>SQSTM1</em> gene on chromosome 5q35 have been identified in both sporadic Paget disease of bone as well as pagetic osteosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In addition to Paget disease, other benign bone lesions have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of malignant degeneration to a primary bone tumor. These include chronic osteomyelitis, fibrous dysplasia, sites of bone infarcts, and benign bone tumors such as fibrous dysplasia and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

The risk for later development of osteogenic sarcoma is not only within irradiated fields, but also in long bones distant from radiation ports. Patients with the sporadic type of retinoblastoma are at a much lower risk compared with patients with hereditary disease. As an example, in one study of 1604 patients with retinoblastoma, the cumulative incidence of a second cancer at 50 years after diagnosis was 51 percent for hereditary cases, compared with only 5 percent for nonhereditary (sporadic) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Although they tend to have a lower rate of tumor necrosis following induction chemotherapy, long-term survival rates are similar to conventional osteosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Surface (juxtacortical) osteosarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to these intramedullary variants, the surface osteosarcomas differ with respect to prognosis and therapy. These osteosarcomas include the parosteal low-grade type, the intermediate-grade periosteal type, and the high-grade surface osteosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>].

It occurs in an older age group than conventional intramedullary osteosarcoma, usually between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The posterior aspect of the distal femur is the most commonly involved site, but other long bones may be affected. The tumor arises from the cortex as a broadly based lesion. With time, however, this lesion may invade the cortex and enter the endosteal cavity. Treatment for conventional parosteal osteosarcomas is surgical resection alone with expected survival rates of approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]; however, in patients with de-differentiated parosteal osteosarcomas adjuvant chemotherapy may be employed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periosteal osteosarcoma &ndash; Periosteal osteosarcoma is a moderate-grade, chondroblastic surface osteosarcoma frequently located in the proximal tibia, which has the same age distribution as conventional intramedullary osteosarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68702\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68702 \">image 4</a>). The likelihood of metastases is greater than that for the low-grade parosteal tumors, but lower than the classic intramedullary osteosarcoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for periosteal osteosarcomas is controversial. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in many centers because of the estimated 20 percent metastatic rate. However, retrospective reports indicate more favorable outcomes than seen with classic osteosarcomas (84 percent 10-year survival rate in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]), a lack of benefit when patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were compared with those treated by surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>], and a concerning number of second malignant neoplasms in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age distribution of osteosarcoma incidence is bimodal, with peaks in early adolescence and in adults over the age of 65. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor affecting children and young adults; the peak age is between 13 and 16. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, the majority of osteosarcomas are sporadic. A minority of cases are associated with inherited predisposition syndromes such as hereditary retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and the related Bloom and Werner syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteosarcomas in adults are often considered secondary neoplasms, attributed to sarcomatous transformation of Paget disease of bone or some other benign bone lesion. In the United States, over one-half of all osteosarcomas arising in patients over the age of 60 are secondary, while in Asia, Paget disease is less frequent and a higher percentage arise primarily. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Paget disease and other benign bone lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with osteosarcoma present with localized pain, typically of several months' duration. The most important finding on physical examination is a soft tissue mass, which is frequently large and tender to palpation. At presentation, between 10 and 20 percent have demonstrable metastatic disease, most often involving the lung. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Proper planning of the biopsy with careful consideration of future definitive surgery is important so as not to jeopardize subsequent treatment, particularly the opportunity for limb salvage. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histologic diagnosis of an osteosarcoma is based on the presence of a malignant sarcomatous stroma, associated with the production of tumor osteoid and bone. Conventional (intramedullary high-grade) osteosarcomas account for approximately 90 percent of all osteosarcomas. Other less common histologic variants are small cell, telangiectatic, multifocal, surface (juxtacortical), and extraosseous osteosarcomas, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma of bone (previously known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone), and osteosarcoma of the jaw. Jaw osteosarcoma is more common in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Histologic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of an osteosarcoma is established, the staging evaluation should include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire length of the involved bone, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, radionuclide bone scanning with technetium, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan.
