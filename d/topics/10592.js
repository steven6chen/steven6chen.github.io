Some patient comorbidities also increase bleeding rates. Typical bleeding rates reported in randomized trials are in the range of 1 to 3 percent per person-year.

The risk of spontaneous ICH in a patient receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is increased approximately two- to fivefold over baseline with the absolute risk determined by underlying patient characteristics (eg, age, intensity of anticoagulation) as discussed in detail separately.

Importantly, some of these risk factors are modifiable, and addressing modifiable risk factors may ultimately reduce the risks of both bleeding and thrombosis. </p><p>Bleeding is increased in the setting of supratherapeutic INR, but even patients with a therapeutic INR can have an increased risk of bleeding, especially those older than 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The INR over which bleeding risk increases varies among studies. Studies in patients with atrial fibrillation indicate that the risk of bleeding increases substantially at INR values &ge;5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65373\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65373 \">figure 1</a>), although other studies including those with other patient populations have shown an increased risk of bleeding when the INR is &gt;3.0 or 3.5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78252\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78252 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11547726\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for supratherapeutic INR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> frequently become excessively anticoagulated, even those who have been stable for many months. The most common causes of a supratherapeutic INR are interactions between warfarin and other drugs or superimposed conditions (eg, liver disease, malabsorption) that may interfere with warfarin ingestion, absorption, or metabolism. Many of these risk factors are modifiable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> could be accompanied by more intensive monitoring.</p><p>Major classes of modifiable factors include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient comorbidities (eg, heart failure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute illnesses (eg, infections, gastrointestinal illnesses)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication interactions (eg, antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], some anti-ulcer medications)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large day-to-day variations in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> intake</p><p/><p>Comorbidities should be managed appropriately, and acute illnesses should be addressed promptly.

The choice among these approaches depends on the perceived likelihood of progression to more severe bleeding. The approach is based largely on clinical judgment that considers the extent and site of bleeding, previous bleeding, comorbidities such as renal insufficiency or hypertension, INR level, and likelihood that the INR may be rising, based on the percent of time the INR has been supratherapeutic over the previous few measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
