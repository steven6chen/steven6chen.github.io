The purpose of temporary pacing is to re-establish circulatory integrity and normal hemodynamics that are acutely compromised by a slow or fast heart rate. In some situations, temporary pacing can be lifesaving.</p><p>This topic will review the indications, contraindications, techniques, and procedural aspects of temporary cardiac pacing. Issues related to permanent cardiac pacing are discussed separately.

However, temporary cardiac pacing is most commonly used for patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, most frequently due to atrioventricular (AV) nodal block. When it is evident that a permanent pacemaker is ultimately indicated, many implanting clinicians proceed directly with implantation of a permanent pacemaker. (See <a href=\"#H2951555\" class=\"local\">'Temporary versus permanent cardiac pacing as the initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, temporary cardiac pacing is indicated when a bradyarrhythmia causes symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe hemodynamic impairment and when permanent cardiac pacing is not immediately indicated, not available, or the risk of inserting a permanent pacemaker exceeds potential benefit. The main reason for temporary cardiac pacing is to treat severe symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic instability due to a bradycardia, or to prevent potential deterioration resulting in hemodynamic instability. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversible conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing is indicated for bradycardia that results from an acute and reversible cause that will likely not require permanent pacing.

Revascularization strategies with thrombolysis and angioplasty have significantly reduced the need for temporary and permanent cardiac pacing since there is often less myocardial damage and a greater chance that bradycardia and conduction abnormalities will not occur. There may, however, be a need for temporary cardiac pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important consideration in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction is that a bradycardia, even if asymptomatic or transient, can cause decreased coronary blood flow and reduced myocardial perfusion. Guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology recommend temporary bradycardia pacing in patients with high-grade AV block <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> new bundle branch block (particularly left bundle branch block) or bifascicular block in patients with an <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/lateral</span> myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clinical judgment should be used when applying the guidelines to an individual patient's clinical situation and weighing the risk versus benefits of placing a temporary pacing lead.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542216485\"><span class=\"h3\">Weighing the benefits of temporary pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A difficult issue is when, and if, a temporary pacemaker is needed for patients with intermittent conduction abnormalities. As an example, a patient admitted to the hospital because of presyncope who has a single, five-second pause documented on continuous monitoring might not need a temporary pacemaker wire, particularly since its insertion might actually cause complications that would offset any potential benefit. Similarly, a patient with complete heart block who has a stable escape rhythm can usually wait for a permanent pacemaker; a temporary pacemaker in such a patient might result in pacemaker-dependence with the risk of asystole if the lead dislodges. In such patients, it is best to place a temporary pacing wire only if there is the imminent risk of asystole before a permanent pacemaker can be placed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent pacemaker system revisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing is required in patients <strong>who are pacemaker-dependent</strong> when a pacemaker generator change or lead <span class=\"nowrap\">revision/replacement</span> is needed for any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacemaker system (generator <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lead) infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular lead malfunction or failure</p><p/><p>For the pacemaker-dependent patient whose pulse generator has reached elective replacement indicators, a temporary pacemaker would usually be placed at the onset of the permanent pulse generator replacement. In such situations, consideration must be given to a potential interaction between the permanent and temporary cardiac pacemakers. If, for example, the temporary cardiac pacemaker fails to capture but its output or pacing stimulus is sensed by the permanent cardiac pacemaker, the permanent cardiac pacemaker might be inhibited, resulting in a severe bradycardia or asystole. With a temporary pacemaker in place and programmed asynchronously, there would not be concern about interference from electrocautery, which would likely be used for dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to cauterize any bleeding within the pocket.</p><p>With a functioning temporary pacemaker in place, there is no concern about maintaining an adequate heart rate when the permanent pulse generator is disconnected and a new one placed. There are some experienced implanters who prefer to do a very fast switch between the old and new pulse generator and avoid temporary pacemaker placement. However, this leaves the potential for asystole if there are any problems with the pulse generator switch, and placing a temporary pacemaker for dependent patients is the typical approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pacing to prevent tachyarrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid temporary cardiac pacing can be used in some situations to prevent a tachyarrhythmia from occurring.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Post-cardiac surgery</strong> &mdash; Overdrive pacing has been used after cardiac surgery to prevent atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, although beta blockers are usually the treatment of choice. The potential efficacy of overdrive pacing was illustrated in a randomized trial of 96 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery who were in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drugs on the second postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overdrive pacing for 24 hours significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation (10 versus 27 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias</strong> &mdash; Some ventricular tachycardias can be prevented by rapid pacing. An example is torsades des pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with a long QT interval. Atrial or ventricular pacing at rates between 90 and 110 beats per minute can prevent initiation of torsades des pointes by shortening the QT interval and by preventing ventricular premature beats that might trigger the tachycardia. This approach is not commonly used but may be effective for some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of congenital long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias or other indications for temporary cardiac pacing, there are no absolute contraindications, particularly in patients who have life-threatening hemodynamic instability. However, temporary transvenous cardiac pacing should be avoided or used with caution in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with intermittent, mild or rare symptoms in whom the bradycardia is well tolerated. This includes symptomatic complete heart block with an adequate and &quot;stable&quot; escape rhythm or symptomatic sick sinus syndrome with only rare pauses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a prosthetic tricuspid valve, as the temporary cardiac pacemaker lead could damage the valve or become trapped in the prosthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with a myocardial infarction who has received a thrombolytic agent and is being aggressively treated with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents. Even insertion of the catheter by a cutdown, thus allowing direct visualization of the vessel and better control of bleeding, may be associated with significant bleeding in such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13078052\"><span class=\"h1\">PACING TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2951555\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporary versus permanent cardiac pacing as the initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main reason for temporary cardiac pacing is to treat severe symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic instability due to a bradycardia, or to prevent potential deterioration resulting in hemodynamic instability. However, when it is evident that a permanent pacemaker is indicated, many electrophysiologists proceed directly with implantation of a permanent pacemaker to minimize the number of procedures performed and the associated complications related to temporary cardiac pacing.

Transvenous pacing requires expertise in both venous and cardiac anatomy in order to effectively access the vasculature and advance the electrode into the heart. (See <a href=\"#H13078138\" class=\"local\">'Transvenous lead placement'</a> below.)</p><p>Transvenous pacing has the advantages of being more comfortable for the patient (compared with transcutaneous pacing) and more durable (compared with both transcutaneous and epicardial pacing) in patients in whom the anticipated duration of temporary cardiac pacing may be several days to weeks. Limitations to traditional transvenous pacing using a lead specifically designed for temporary pacing include limited patient mobility (most patients will be restricted to bed or chair and cannot ambulate).</p><p>There are some situations when a longer duration of temporary pacing will be required. The most common scenario is removal of an infected system in a patient where bacteremia or endocarditis is present and prolonged antibiotics will be required to clear the systemic infection prior to implantation of a new pacing system. In such patients, essentially normal mobility can be restored if a permanent active fixation pacing lead (typically with a peel-away sheath) is placed in the right ventricle via internal jugular venous access and connected to a standard permanent pacemaker that is then secured to the patient. </p><p>Centers that do a relatively high volume of pacemaker implants may have a device that cannot be permanently implanted because it is beyond its expiration date or it has been contaminated. There have been several published series using variations of this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>More details regarding the placement of transvenous pacing electrodes are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H13078080\" class=\"local\">'Procedural aspects of temporary transvenous pacing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13078059\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most situations where urgent temporary cardiac pacing is needed, transcutaneous pacing is the technique that can be initiated most rapidly. Adhesive pads are placed directly on the patient's chest, typically in the anterior and left lateral positions or in the anterior and posterior positions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103268 \">figure 1</a>). The pads are in addition to the standard adhesive electrodes for telemetry monitoring, which may need to be slightly repositioned to accommodate the transcutaneous pacing pads. In some patients with large amounts of body hair, the area will need to be shaved to allow for proper adhesive contact.</p><p>Transcutaneous pacing is limited by two significant clinical issues, namely high capture thresholds and patient discomfort:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to achieve capture and successfully pace the heart &ndash; Because of the impedance of the intervening chest wall structures (ie, skin, musculature, and bony and connective tissues) and the difficulty in knowing the exact location of the heart within the thorax, successful capture and pacing are not achieved in all patients. In addition, capture may be interrupted due to patient movement or inadequate adhesion of the pads to the chest wall (eg, in a diaphoretic patient). Another pitfall is difficulty assessing capture as the large stimulus artifact can make the monitor misleading, given the appearance of capture when this is not actually the case.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient discomfort &ndash; In order to overcome the higher impedance associated with intervening chest wall structures to successfully stimulate the myocardium, relatively higher energy levels are required when using transcutaneous pacing. This can result in non-myocardial muscle stimulation and discomfort that is not tolerated by the patient.</p><p/><p>Because of the limitations associated with transcutaneous pacing, this method should be considered only as a temporizing measure for unconscious patients or those in whom sedation can be administered, until either temporary transvenous pacing can be established or until a permanent cardiac pacemaker can be inserted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13078073\"><span class=\"h3\">Epicardial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing with epicardial pacing wires is used exclusively following cardiac surgery and can be used for temporary cardiac pacing if bradycardia occurs, or for overdrive pacing of postoperative tachyarrhythmias. Leads may be attached to the atrium, ventricle, or both chambers at the time of the cardiac surgical procedure, with the wires tunneled and externalized. </p><p>In most patients, temporary epicardial pacing is utilized only during the initial days following surgery. Temporary epicardial leads are generally only used for a limited period because of problems that can develop. One concern is that, when present for more than one week, the pacing threshold will often rise and there may not be adequate and reliable capture. Once the pacing threshold rises or consistent capture is not possible, the leads should be removed and an alternate means of temporary cardiac pacing, if needed, should be instituted if the clinical requirement persists.</p><p>A variety of temporary epicardial leads are available, and the surgeon must be aware of the differences and various fixation mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542215427\"><span class=\"h3\">Transesophageal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transesophageal pacemaker lead can be used for atrial pacing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recording. It can be inserted through the mouth or the nose, depending upon the type of catheter used. However, the catheter is uncomfortable to place, pacing is unreliable, and pain is common because it requires high current and pulse width for adequate and continual capture. For these reasons, transesophageal pacing is not commonly used, although it may occasionally have a role for diagnostic purposes. It has also been of some use for pace termination of atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter and for establishing the presence of intrinsic sinus activity (P waves) if they are not obvious on the electrocardiogram.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2951526\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent cardiac pacing techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent cardiac pacing is discussed in detail separately.

In addition, the subclavian approach permits more freedom of patient motion and might be useful in a patient who requires a long-term temporary pacemaker. A brachial vein approach is not recommended because of the risk of cardiac puncture and instability. While a femoral vein approach is fairly common, particularly among patients who receive a temporary pacemaker in the cardiac catheterization lab while undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, this approach is not recommended for longer-term temporary pacing because of the risks of deep vein thrombosis and infection and the need for the patient to remain continuously supine. </p><p>Ultimately, however, the best approach to minimize complications is the one with which the clinician has the most experience. If there is a high likelihood that a permanent pacemaker will be required, this should be taken into account at the time the venous access site for the temporary pacemaker is chosen. For example, if a patient is left-hand dominant and the permanent pacemaker would be placed in the right pre-pectoral region, then it would be desirable to use a site other than the right subclavian vein for the temporary lead.</p><p>An extensive discussion of the preparation and techniques used for achieving central venous access is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13078138\"><span class=\"h2\">Transvenous lead placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once central venous access has been secured and the introducer sheath is in place, the transvenous lead is inserted and advanced into the heart. The progress of the advancing lead can be monitored in several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lead markings</strong> &ndash; Leads designed as temporary transvenous leads have markings indicating the distance from the tip of the lead; these should be monitored to estimate the location of the lead tip within the vasculature or the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring</strong> &ndash; Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended during the insertion of a transvenous pacing lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. In nearly all patients, frequent ventricular premature beats or brief runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia will be seen when the tip of the transvenous pacing lead encounters the right ventricular myocardium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluoroscopy</strong> &ndash; Fluoroscopy, either from a portable bedside unit or in a dedicated procedure room, is highly desirable and helpful when available as it allows for direct visualization of the transvenous pacing lead and optimal placement of the lead within the right ventricle. While not always necessary for lead placement via subclavian or internal jugular venous access, fluoroscopy is required for placement via femoral venous access in order to manipulate the catheter into the proper position. If fluoroscopy is not available, a preformed balloon-tipped catheter can be placed from the right internal jugular or left subclavian vein as it will tend to &quot;float&quot; toward the right ventricle. A balloon-tipped catheter cannot generally be placed during cardiac arrest due to inadequate blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> &ndash; Continuous echocardiographic monitoring has also been successfully used for placement of temporary pacing wires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p>When the lead is placed in the right ventricular apex, there should be slight excess lead or &quot;slack&quot; (pressure at the tip, with a bend at the tricuspid ring) to ensure that the lead does not become dislodged. The lead should be tied down. If a technique has been used where the vein is visualized, then a &quot;tie&quot; is placed where the lead exits from the vein, and then another tie is placed between the patient's skin and a loop formed with the lead. The loop should be large enough to prevent tension on the lead, preventing it from becoming dislodged and the pacemaker losing capture. If the lead was placed in a percutaneous fashion, for example, then it is common to only place a tie between the patient's skin and a loop formed with the lead.</p><p>When a patient is pacemaker-dependent, it is crucial that the lead be placed in a stable position, and fluoroscopy should be used whenever possible.</p><p>Temporary dual-chamber pacing may rarely be useful for patients who require atrioventricular (AV) sequential pacing for hemodynamic benefit. Included in this group are patients with an acute myocardial infarction, particularly when associated with right ventricular involvement, and after cardiac surgery, especially when diastolic dysfunction is present.</p><p>Temporary BiV pacing with a transvenous pacing catheter placed in a coronary vein via the coronary sinus may provide short-term benefit to selected patients but is not a standard clinical technique at this time. It has been shown to be of value in cardiogenic shock and to improve coronary artery bypass graft flow following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542215840\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of transvenous leads</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various types of transvenous leads are available. Transvenous pacing leads are typically stiffer than permanent pacing leads, making manipulation more difficult, but the leads are balloon-tipped for easier insertion. They come with various curves, including a preformed atrial &quot;J&quot; wire, and in 2, 5, 6, and 7 French sizes; they are generally bipolar or quadripolar. As noted, another option is to &quot;exteriorize&quot; permanent pacemaker leads if long-term temporary pacing (ie, weeks) is being considered. These leads can then be removed when temporary pacing is no longer needed. (See <a href=\"#H410648640\" class=\"local\">'Transvenous'</a> above.)</p><p>Endocardial screw-in temporary leads can be used to help maintain stability. These leads, purposefully flimsy, are thin and deployed through a sheath that is then removed. These leads can maintain excellent pacing and sensing thresholds for many days. </p><p>In general, atrial leads are not inserted when bradycardia alone is the indication for pacing. However, an atrial lead is inserted for the rare patient who has symptomatic sinus pauses or sinus bradycardia but intact AV nodal conduction, or pace termination of atrial tachyarrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, and rarely to provide AV synchrony for hemodynamic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. The benefits of atrial pacing for conditions of sinus bradycardia or junctional rhythm are most prominent after cardiac surgery for patients with ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy, or heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542216123\"><span class=\"h2\">Connecting the lead and pulse generator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The connector cable linking the transvenous pacing lead to the pacemaker generator is a simple aspect of the system, but it is important for these connectors to be screwed tightly and securely fastened. An improper connection or inadvertent disconnection can result in pacing malfunction or even asystole and possibly death in a patient who is pacemaker-dependent. Even if a patient is not initially pacemaker-dependent but is then paced, abrupt disconnection of the pacing or turning off of the pacemaker could lead to asystole due to newly acquired pacemaker-dependence as a result of overdrive pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Several types of pulse generators are available that permit single- and dual-chamber pacing. For the vast majority of patients, single-chamber ventricular temporary pacing is most appropriate. For the patient with symptomatic sinus arrest and completely normal AV nodal conduction, atrial temporary pacing may be utilized. (See <a href=\"#H13078145\" class=\"local\">'Pacemaker programming'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13078145\"><span class=\"h2\">Pacemaker programming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temporary pacing rate should be set to whatever rate optimizes the patient's hemodynamics. For a pediatric patient and often for postoperative patients, a faster heart rate (eg, 80 to 100 beats per minute) may be desired. For most other patients, a rate of 60 to 70 beats per minute will likely be adequate. If the patient is pacemaker-dependent, then the temporary pacer can be turned to the least sensitive value (ie, the temporary pacemaker will essentially function in an asynchronous mode). If the patient has an intermittent intrinsic ventricular rhythm, then the sensitivity should be adjusted to allow normal sensing of the intrinsic events.</p><p>To ensure proper pacemaker sensing and capture, the pacemaker output should be set at least two to three times the pacing threshold (ie, the minimum output necessary for pacemaker capture). The pacing threshold, especially in the ventricle, should ideally be less than or equal to 1 milliamp, especially for the patient who is pacemaker-dependent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542216583\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications are not uncommon in patients treated with temporary cardiac pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/temporary-cardiac-pacing/abstract/32,34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34-39</a>]. Complications may be related to venous access, the transvenous pacing lead, or external electromagnetic interference. The complications associated with temporary cardiac pacing, particularly temporary transvenous cardiac pacing, have led to many clinicians frequently proceeding directly with implantation of a permanent pacemaker (when the likelihood of conduction system recovery is minimal) or to utilizing a temporary transvenous system with a permanent endocardial screw-in lead.

Additionally, an immediate post-procedure 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be recorded during pacing to determine the electrocardiographic appearance of the QRS complex. Although a standard transvenous ventricular lead is often positioned at or near the right ventricular apex, if a permanent endocardial lead is used for longer-term temporary pacing, the lead could be placed essentially anywhere in the right ventricle. With the lead positioned in the right ventricle, the QRS should generally have a left bundle branch block morphology and a superior axis (ie, an upright QRS complex in lead I and aVL). </p><p>A physical examination should be performed immediately following transvenous lead placement, with subsequent daily assessments, to evaluate for any of the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial friction rub, which may be indicative of cardiac perforation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension with muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distension, suggesting cardiac tamponade</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetrical or absent breaths sounds, suggesting a pneumothorax</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542216421\"><span class=\"h2\">Management for the duration of temporary pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous ECG monitoring is mandatory during the entire time the patient has a temporary cardiac pacemaker, and a separate intravenous access is recommended should there be a need for drug therapy.

Daily ECGs are also not needed.</p><p>Patients with temporary pacemakers require a daily check of pacing thresholds to make certain that there is proper capture. The need to continue temporary cardiac pacing should be re-evaluated daily, with device removal if the patient has recovered stable intrinsic electrical activity or consideration of permanent cardiac pacing if indicated. If there are any episodes of failure to sense a ventricular premature beat or an intrinsic normally conducted QRS complex, the sensing of the temporary pacemaker should be reevaluated. </p><p>The dressing at the site of pacemaker insertion should be changed daily. In most institutions a special dressing may be applied that is felt to resist infection. Local practice in some institutions also includes prophylactic intravenous antibiotic coverage (typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> to cover potential skin organisms) for the duration of temporary pacemaker therapy. Fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local erythema or drainage at the venous access site would suggest an infection and should prompt appropriate evaluation and, if needed, removal of the temporary pacing system. The stability of the wire and the loop should be checked to prevent inadvertent dislodgement of the lead.

The purpose of temporary pacing is to re-establish circulatory integrity and normal hemodynamics that are acutely compromised by a slow or fast heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing is most commonly utilized for patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, most frequently due to atrioventricular (AV) nodal block. Temporary cardiac pacing for bradycardia that results from an acute and reversible cause (eg, acute myocardial infarction, electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicities, Lyme disease, etc) will often not require permanent pacing. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary cardiac pacing can be performed in a variety of ways, most commonly via transvenous endocardial leads designed for temporary pacing, transvenous endocardial leads designed for permanent cardiac pacing if longer-term temporary pacing will be required, or transcutaneous leads. Temporary transvenous pacing is the preferred approach for most patients, although transcutaneous pacing can be initiated more rapidly in an emergency. (See <a href=\"#H13078052\" class=\"local\">'Pacing techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred access sites for temporary transvenous pacing leads are the left subclavian vein and the right internal jugular vein; this relates primarily to the curvature of the lead and ease of advancing the lead into the heart. A brachial vein approach is not recommended because of the risk of cardiac puncture and instability, while a femoral vein approach is not recommended because of the risks of deep vein thrombosis and infection and the need for the patient to remain continuously supine. (See <a href=\"#H13078131\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once central venous access has been secured and the introducer sheath is in place, the transvenous lead is inserted and advanced into the heart. The progress of the advancing lead can be monitored using lead marking, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluoroscopy. (See <a href=\"#H13078138\" class=\"local\">'Transvenous lead placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The temporary pacing rate should be set to whatever rate optimizes the patient's hemodynamics.
