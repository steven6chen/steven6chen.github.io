ESA resistance is generally relative rather than complete. ESA resistance is also referred to as hyporesponsiveness.</p><p>Criteria for ESA resistance are not well defined.

Iron deficiency may be absolute (which is often due to external blood losses) or functional (related to ESA administration or anemia of chronic disease). All patients with ESA resistance should be assessed for absolute and functional iron deficiency.

In an old study of 20 stable hemodialysis patients who were modestly under-dialyzed (mean urea reduction ratio [URR] 60.7 percent), increasing the dialysis dose was associated with an increase in hematocrit despite a constant dose of ESA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Differences in the dialysis membrane may have affected the ESA response since the increase in urea clearance was achieved by changing to a larger dialyzer with a different membrane. However, the dialyzer membrane has not been shown to affect the ESA response in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>An increase in the dialysis dose is unlikely to increase ESA response in patients who are already being adequately dialyzed (ie, single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.0 to 1.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,20</a>].

This association is believed to be related to reduced inflammation. Ultrapure dialysate is dialysate that is of much higher microbiologic purity than is required by some international and national standards.

ESA resistance is associated with increased mortality, and many causes of ESA resistance can be addressed. Our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We exclude both absolute and functional iron deficiency and treat with iron, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We make sure patients are adequately dialyzed.

Among those with a hemodialysis catheter, placement of arteriovenous access and removal of the catheter may also improve ESA responsiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, we attempt to restore optimal parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations with pharmacologic therapy or parathyroidectomy. Treatment of hyperparathyroidism improves ESA response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

In one observational study of hemodialysis patients in the United States, patients who had hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and received larger ESA dose changes over an 11-month period had a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In another study that used data from the Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial, a higher erythropoietin-responsiveness measure (defined as the ratio of the weekly hematocrit change per ESA dose increase) was associated with lower mortality (with an adjusted HR of 0.41 for highest versus lowest quartiles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The effect of ESA resistance on mortality among peritoneal dialysis patients has not been well studied. One study from Korea suggested that ESA resistance was associated with higher mortality among hemodialysis patients but not peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, other studies that have compared hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have not found such an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The increased mortality associated with ESA resistance is likely due to the underlying cause of ESA resistance. However, some studies have suggested that the increased mortality is related to the higher ESA doses that are used in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/43,47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47-53</a>]. As an example, in an unadjusted analysis of the Correction of Hemoglobin in the Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) trial, an increased risk of the primary composite endpoint (death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke) at four months was associated with both an inability to achieve target levels and higher doses of epoetin (&gt;20,000 units per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, adjusted analysis found that <strong>only</strong> high-dose epoetin therapy resulted in an independent increased risk of the primary composite endpoint (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.36). This increased risk was observed in both high- and low-target Hb groups, particularly among those unable to reach target Hb levels.</p><p>In addition, a meta-regression analysis of 31 trials (12,956 patients) found that all-cause mortality was associated with higher first three-month and total-study-period mean ESA dose independent of Hb level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. There was a similar trend for cardiovascular mortality that was not statistically significant. Higher total-study-period mean ESA dose also was associated with an increased rate of hypertension, stroke, and thrombotic events, including dialysis vascular access-related thrombotic events.</p><p>However the association between higher ESA doses and mortality has not been shown in all studies. In one observational study of older hemodialysis patients, doses of epoetin that exceeded 30,000 units per week were not associated with harm or benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4015848632\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESA resistance may be associated with more rapid progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This was suggested by a study of 194 consecutive CKD patients who started ESAs between 2002 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].
