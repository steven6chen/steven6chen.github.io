CD comprises at least two distinct diseases (unicentric and multicentric) with very different prognoses. It may also be associated with other malignancies, including Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and POEMS syndrome.</p><p>CD was first described in 1956 by Benjamin Castleman and colleagues, who identified a series of patients with solitary hyperplastic mediastinal lymph nodes containing small, hyalinized follicles and a marked interfollicular vascular proliferation (hyaline vascular variant of CD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The same investigators later identified lymph nodes with a similar vascular proliferation associated with large hyperplastic germinal centers and sheets of interfollicular plasma cells. Hyalinized follicles were present in some, but not all, such cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the patients described in these early papers had localized disease, which is now termed unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD). UCD is associated with systemic symptoms in a subset of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a systemic disease with generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, frequent fevers, and night sweats that is usually associated with the plasma cell or mixed variant. Unlike UCD, MCD is strongly associated with immunosuppression and HHV-8 infection.</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, pathologic features, diagnosis and treatment of MCD. UCD, diseases associated with HHV-8 infection, and the virology of HHV-8 are presented separately.

Fifty to 65 percent are male.</p><p>The incidence of HIV-associated MCD has increased in the years since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the management of HIV. The incidence of HIV-associated MCD was calculated from a prospective HIV database with 56,202 patient-years of follow-up and compared with that of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) during the same time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of MCD increased over the time periods designated as pre-ART (1983-1996), early-ART (1997-2001), and later ART (2002-2007) eras and was 0.6, 2.8, and 8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/10,000</span> patient-years, respectively. In contrast, the incidence of KS decreased markedly during the same three time periods and was 520, 85, and 63 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/10,000</span> patient-years, respectively. The explanation for the apparent increase in MCD with the introduction of ART is uncertain. One possibility is that subtle forms of immune dysregulation are of greater importance in the etiology of HIV-associated MCD than immunosuppression per se. On multivariate analysis, risk factors for the development of MCD included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nadir CD4 count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;200/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No previous ART exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Caucasian ethnicity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6089103\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is poorly understood. Both unicentric Castleman's disease (UCD) and MCD have been linked to excessive release of interleukin (IL)-6 or related polypeptides (eg, a homolog of IL-6 that is encoded in the HHV-8 genome). Unlike UCD, MCD is more commonly associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection. The role of HHV-8 and IL-6 in MCV is presented here. The pathogenesis of UCD is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unicentric-castlemans-disease#H3031617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6088615\"><span class=\"h2\">Human herpesvirus 8</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major advance in defining and understanding the pathogenesis of MCD came with the identification of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in a significant number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. HHV-8 is a gamma herpesvirus similar to Epstein-Barr virus that has been found in both endemic and HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease associations of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two major lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with this virus: primary effusion lymphomas (PEL) and MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. The latter may progress to a B cell plasmablastic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A third rare, but apparently distinctive, B cell proliferation, referred to as germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder, has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. HHV-8 positive MCD and plasmablastic lymphoma are not associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, whereas in PEL and germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder, co-infection of the neoplastic B cells by HHV-8 and EBV is common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary effusion lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>A pathogenic relationship between MCD and HHV-8 was sought because of the well-recognized clinical association of KS and MCD. In one study, HHV-8 DNA was detected in lymph node biopsies in all 14 cases of HIV-associated MCD tested and in 7 of 17 cases of HIV-negative MCD, compared with 1 of 51 HIV-negative reactive lymph nodes and 3 of 17 HIV-positive reactive lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Since then, other studies have confirmed that HHV-8 involvement is universal in HIV-associated MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and in approximately 40 to 50 percent of HIV-negative MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. The association between HIV-negative MCD and HHV-8 may vary with the prevalence of HHV-8 in the population. In Japan, where the seroprevalence of HHV-8 is extremely low, HHV-8 was found only in HIV-infected patients with MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Immunohistochemical stains for virally encoded antigens have demonstrated that HHV-8 is present in approximately 10 to 30 percent of the mantle zone lymphoid cells of HHV-8+ MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. These cells have immunoblastic morphology, are variably positive for CD20, and express the transcription factor <span class=\"nowrap\">MUM1/IRF4</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31-34</a>]. Curiously, the HHV-8 infected cells always express high levels of cytoplasmic IgM lambda immunoglobulin, which is consistent with in vitro studies showing that HHV-8 preferentially establishes stable infection in tonsillar B cells expressing IgM lambda immunoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Somatic hypermutation of the Ig genes is not observed, which may indicate an origin from a naive B cell or, alternatively, from an IgM-expressing memory B cell; IgM memory cells have been identified in tonsils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], the anatomic site where primary infection with HHV8 is believed to occur. Immunoblasts with these features are absent from UCD and HHV-8-negative MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The interfollicular plasma cells, which are not infected with HHV-8 in MCD, express IgG or IgA immunoglobulins and are polytypic with respect to light chain expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>HHV-8-infected immunoblasts are highly proliferative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and may coalesce to form so-called &quot;microlymphomas,&quot; or give rise to frank plasmablastic lymphoma. Despite their monotypic IgM lambda expression, the HHV-8-positive proliferation in MCD has polyclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, even in most cases that have progressed to &quot;microlymphomas&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, HHV-8 genomes within MCD lesions are also polyclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Plasmablastic lymphomas arising out of HHV-8+ MCD are monoclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34</a>]. It is hypothesized that the hyperproliferative state induced by HHV-8 permits the accumulation of new mutations in the genomes of the infected B immunoblasts. Positive selection for clones bearing mutations that enhance growth and survival then allows an initially reactive process to evolve over time into an overt lymphoma. This model is similar to that proposed for the continuum of lymphoproliferative disorders that are associated with Epstein-Barr virus in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6089332\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of interleukin-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both UCD and MCD have been linked to excessive release of IL-6 or similar polypeptides. Early studies linked local production of IL-6 to the systemic manifestations of UCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>] since lymph node excision resulted in relief of symptoms along with a decrease in IL-6 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The precise cells within the lymph node responsible for production of IL-6 have remained elusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; candidate cells include blastic B cells of the germinal centers, follicular dendritic cells, or cells present in the interfollicular regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In mice, transgenic expression of IL-6 by hematopoietic progenitor cells results in a syndrome similar to MCD, with peripheral lymphadenopathy, extensive plasma cell infiltration of lymphoid tissues, splenomegaly, anemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Particularly during lytic (replicative) infection, but to a lesser degree during latent infection as well, HHV-8-positive B cells secrete a virally encoded form of IL-6 (vIL-6) that activates the human IL-6 receptor. In addition to HHV-8-positive Castleman's disease, vIL-6 is also secreted from primary effusion lymphomas, but only rarely in KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/32,33,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,41,42</a>]. Between 5 and 25 percent of the HHV-8 infected immunoblasts in the mantle zone of MCD lymph nodes express vIL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/32,33,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,41,42</a>]. Evidence linking vIL-6 to MCD pathogenesis includes the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-level expression of vIL-6 in fibroblasts injected into athymic mice has reproduced a syndrome similar to MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgenic expression of vIL-6 in mice produces a disorder with features similar to human MCD, including splenomegaly, multifocal lymphadenopathy, hypergammaglobulinemia, and plasmacytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Of interest, this phenotype requires the murine IL-6 gene, suggesting that vIL-6 and endogenous IL-6 interact in some way to produce these abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While vIL-6 induces the proliferation of human myeloma cell lines, it is only approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000<sup>th</sup></span> as potent as human IL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/41,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,45</a>]. Of interest, transgenic mice constitutively expressing vIL-6 spontaneously develop key features of human plasma cell-type MCD, including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hypergammaglobulinemia, and plasmacytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, this phenotype does not occur if the vIL-6 transgene is crossed into IL-6 knockout mice, indicating that endogenous IL-6 is an important cofactor in this model.</p><p/><p>As suggested by the mouse experiments including those described above and in line with its greater potency, human IL-6 (hIL-6) may play a larger role in MCD than vIL-6. Several sources of hIL-6 have been proposed in MCD. HHV-8 gene products, such as LANA-1 and vFLIP, induce the expression of hIL-6 in HHV-8 infected B cells through activation of the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>]. Alternatively, another model proposes that vIL-6 secreted by HHV-8+ cells induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/43,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,51</a>], and that VEGF in turn induces hIL-6 production by endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Increased VEGF expression in interfollicular areas of lymph nodes and elevated serum VEGF levels have been observed in patients with CD, and are possibly responsible for the increased angiogenesis in lymph nodes involved by CD.</p><p>An important pathogenic role for hIL-6 is consistent with effects of neutralizing anti-hIL-6 antibodies. Treatment with antibodies that specifically inhibit hIL-6 can result in the resolution of the systemic symptoms and hypergammaglobulinemia of MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In addition, in two patients with MCD, serum hepcidin levels fell rapidly following administration of an IL-6 receptor antibody, with subsequent near-normalization of hemoglobin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These initial results suggest that IL-6-induced hepcidin overproduction is involved in the pathophysiology of the anemia commonly observed in this disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic patients with HHV-8-positive Castleman's disease have HHV-8 viral loads that are 2 logs greater than asymptomatic HHV-8-positive patients; the increased viral load correlates with increased serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. On the other hand, this degree of increased serum HHV-8 viral load is not seen in patients with active KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14413159\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation in multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is variable and depends on the areas of lymph node involvement, production and levels of cytokines such as IL-6 and VEGF, and associated conditions such as <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HHV8</span> infection. Most patients present with nonspecific symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory illness. Less than 10 percent are asymptomatic. Fever is nearly universal and most patients present with night sweats, weight loss, weakness or fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. A subset of patients has edema, body cavity effusions, skin findings, and neurologic changes. </p><p>Skin findings include rash, hemangiomata, and pemphigus. An uncommon presentation of MCD in young adults includes perioral pemphigus and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is associated with a poor outcome. MCD can be part of POEMS, a syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, a monoclonal immunoglobulin spike, and skin changes such as hypertrichosis or hyperpigmentation. Neuropathy seen in patients with MCD is variable, and can range from a mild sensory neuropathy to the severe sensory and motor neuropathy of POEMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Sclerotic bone lesions are also commonly observed. MCD may also be associated with autoimmune diseases including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and acquired factor VIII deficiency. An associated increased vascular permeability leading to peripheral edema and, rarely, pleural effusion and ascites can be seen, especially in those with high VEGF levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoalbuminemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral lymphadenopathy is virtually always present in MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>].

Only approximately 10 percent of HIV-negative cases have mediastinal or abdominal lymphadenopathy at presentation, but with disease progression or in HIV-infected patients at diagnosis, approximately 50 percent have lymph node involvement of these sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The pace of disease development in MCD is variable, with some patients reporting a slow onset over a few years and others becoming acutely ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/5,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,60</a>]. HIV-infected patients tend to pursue an acute course, with a median duration of symptoms at the time of diagnosis of MCD of three months (range: 0.5 to 24 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review that included 72 patients with HIV-associated MCD reported the following symptoms at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphadenopathy &ndash; 96 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly &ndash; 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly &ndash; 63 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary signs or symptoms &ndash; 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p>Kaposi sarcoma was also present in 52 patients (72 percent). Pulmonary symptoms in HIV-infected patients with MCD often include cough or dyspnea, sometimes associated with non-infectious pulmonary interstitial lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates in the absence of infection, with an overall picture that closely resembles lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7,9,39,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,39,62</a>].</p><p>With increased screening measures for HIV, many patients are treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) before the development of complications such as MCD. It is unknown how the clinical manifestations of MCD that develops in patients undergoing treatment with ART differ, if at all, from those of patients who are ART-naive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14413186\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical laboratory abnormalities in MCD include nearly universal anemia, thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. All of these features are related to high IL-6 levels. Anemia is usually mild to moderate, as hemoglobin levels &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are uncommon.

Computed tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) should demonstrate involvement of multiple sites, usually with a relatively low standardized uptake value (SUV, 2.5 to 5). The diagnosis is confirmed upon pathologic review of a biopsy of involved tissue, typically an excisional biopsy of a lymph node. The most abnormal node is selected for biopsy. If no single node predominates, the choice in descending order of preference is supraclavicular, neck, axilla, and groin. Repeat biopsies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis if an initial biopsy fails to confirm the diagnosis and the clinical suspicion remains high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;, section on 'Localized lymphadenopathy'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of MCD requires the clinical features of active disease described above plus pathologic confirmation on biopsy. Biopsy demonstrates polyclonal nodal expansions that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact, and histologic features that are consistent with the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variants. IgH gene rearrangement studies should be performed on the lymph node to rule out a clonal disorder (eg, occult lymphoma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unicentric-castlemans-disease#H3029492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Other disorders that can be associated with hyperplastic lymph nodes containing increased numbers of plasma cells, such as rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases, and HIV infection should be excluded in patients with systemic symptoms.

Initiation of anti-retroviral therapy in patients who are positive for both HIV and HHV-8 may increase the likelihood of developing acute, fulminant MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>], but this remains to be confirmed. </p><p/><p>The prognosis of untreated MCD is poor. The median survival of patients with MCD in the pre-HIV era was 26 to 30 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. In the two largest series of HIV-associated MCD (n = 28), the outcome was even poorer, with an overall mortality of 70 to 85 percent and a median survival of 8 to 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/7,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,34</a>]. A retrospective study analyzed factors that predicted for the onset of active disease in 52 HIV infected patients with MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. The strongest association on multivariate analysis was with rising plasma levels of HHV-8 DNA (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.7).</p><p>HIV-infected patients with MCD are almost universally infected with HHV-8. At present, it is unclear whether the poor outcomes in this group are primarily due to HIV alone, to HHV-8 alone, or to an interaction between the two. The available literature suggests that HHV-8 infection may be the more important factor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of six MCD patients identified in the literature as HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative, four are alive and reportedly well, with two deaths due to lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multicentric-castlemans-disease/abstract/34,42,110,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,42,110,127</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 10 patients identified as HIV-negative and HHV-8-positive, seven have died, including several within a few months of diagnosis.

CD comprises at least two distinct diseases (unicentric and multicentric) with very different prognoses. Both conditions can be associated with development of malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H3034379\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) generally presents in the fifth to sixth decade of life with peripheral lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms including fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Imaging with combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) demonstrates involvement of multiple sites, usually with a relatively low standardized uptake value (SUV). Results from laboratory studies include nearly universal anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is confirmed upon pathologic review of a biopsy of involved tissue, typically an excisional biopsy of a lymph node. Biopsy demonstrates polyclonal nodal expansions that usually leave the structure of the underlying lymph node at least partially intact. Histologic features are consistent with the hyaline vascular or plasma cell variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unicentric-castlemans-disease#H3029492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unicentric Castleman's disease&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outside of a clinical trial, the selection of therapy for MCD first depends upon whether the patient is <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HHV-8</span> positive, and then on the clinical aggressiveness of the disease (see <a href=\"#H21405924\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most symptomatic, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HHV-8</span> negative patients without evidence of organ failure, we suggest the use of immunotherapy alone rather than immunotherapy plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Where available, we prefer monoclonal antibodies directed at IL-6 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=siltuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">siltuximab</a>) or the IL-6 receptor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>). If neither agent is available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H457700\" class=\"local\">'Inhibition of interleukin-6'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those patients with evidence of organ failure or poor performance status thought to be due to the disease, we suggest combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus chemotherapy rather than either immunotherapy or chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Experience is greatest with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenously for four weeks plus rituximab. (See <a href=\"#H16947712\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HHV-8</span> positive patients, we suggest a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> added for those with more symptomatic or aggressive disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If patients have a low CD4 count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher HIV load <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> active Kaposi sarcoma, then antiretroviral therapy is included with the above combination regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1472827\" class=\"local\">'HIV/HHV-8 positive patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be evaluated to determine the disease response to treatment, and should be followed longitudinally for disease progression and complications. We generally administer four cycles of therapy prior to reassessing disease status. If responding, but with evidence of persistent disease activity, then a second round of therapy can be repeated two to three months later. If IL-6-directed therapy is used, it should be given continuously. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> alone or rituximab plus various combination chemotherapies can be given at the time of relapse.
