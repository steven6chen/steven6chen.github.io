In addition to a variable contribution from decreased energy intake, resting energy expenditure can be elevated in CACS in association with increases in both muscle protein breakdown and lipolysis, changes that appear to be due in part to an inflammatory response with the elaboration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta. Tumor-elaborated factors, such as proteolysis-inducing factor and lipid-mobilizing factor, also may play an important role. Unlike starvation, weight loss in cancer arises both from loss of muscle and fat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover pharmacologic treatment for patients with CACS. The clinical features and pathogenesis of CACS, nutritional support for patients with cancer, and a general discussion of assessment and management of <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> in palliative care patients with advanced life-threatening illness are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of anorexia and cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567976308\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cancer-related <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome (CACS) is frequently seen in patients with advanced cancer. One study evaluated 644 consecutive, mostly ambulatory cancer patients: decreased appetite, decreased food intake, and weight loss in excess of 5 percent of premorbid weight were present in more than one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, 54 percent were underweight when compared with the calculated ideal body weight.</p><p>Weight loss in CACS is a marker for both progression of the syndrome and for prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a multi-institutional, retrospective review of 3047 clinical protocol cancer patients from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, weight loss of more than 5 percent of premorbid weight prior to the initiation of chemotherapy was predictive of early mortality. Weight loss was independent of disease stage, tumor histology, and patient performance status in its predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There was also a trend towards lower response rates with the use of chemotherapy among weight-losing patients. This trend reached statistical significance only among patients with breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1567976427\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All cancer patients should be assessed for nutritional status and weight loss. The clinical assessment for patients with anorexia or cachexia includes a careful history that is focused on nutritional issues including risk factors that compromise the ability to obtain or take in nutrition, and a physical examination focusing on loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting (temporal region, deltoids, and quadriceps with loss of bulk and tone by palpation), edema (sacral or ankle), or ascites. The most commonly used objective measures of nutritional status are serial measurement of body weight and assessment of dietary intake, while subjective information on nutritional status can be provided by malnutritional assessment tools. Laboratory measures of nutritional status (eg, albumin, transferrin) are rarely needed for assessment of nutritional status, although some screening tools (eg, the Nutrition Risk Index) do include a measurement of serum albumin. These issues are all addressed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia#H22882419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of anorexia and cachexia&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Loss of appetite and alterations in appearance as a result of cachexia are distressing to both patients and family. The social importance of eating at the dining table with other family members is real. The pleasure of tasting food should be emphasized over total caloric intake. In general, patients with cancer-related <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome (CACS) who are able to eat should be recommended to have small, frequent meals that are dense in calories (eg, eggs, liquid nutritional supplements). Other strategies to enhance caloric intake include eating meals that require little preparation (eg, microwaveable) and resting before meals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia#H20096256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of anorexia and cachexia&quot;, section on 'General aspects'</a>.)</p><p>There is no convincing evidence that nutritional counseling or nutritional supplementation provides major benefits in CACS, though it may provide some helpful information for patients. Nutritional supplementation with parenteral or enteral feeding has only limited efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This finding is not surprising since increased protein catabolism is thought to be a sentinel feature in this syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Indications and benefits of nutritional support in cancer patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer#H21016357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'End of life and cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-assessment-of-cancer-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Optimizing management of major contributors to anorexia, such as chronic nausea, constipation, taste alterations, dyspnea, and depression, may result in some improvement. For patients with persistent anorexia, pharmacologic treatments are available that predominantly stimulate appetite; although they may improve appetite <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight gain in selected patients with CACS, they do not reverse cachexia in most patients, and they do not appear to improve survival, nor have they been demonstrated to improve global quality of life in the majority of studies that have examined such parameters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPETITE STIMULANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) agents that have been relatively well-evaluated in the cancer-related <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> syndrome (CACS) are corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analogs, cannabinoids, and serotonin antagonists. Only corticosteroids and progesterone analogs have proven benefit in palliation of the anorexia associated with this syndrome. It is reasonable to have a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> in patients with CACS who wish to receive it for appetite stimulation. Given the short-term nature of benefit and the potential for serious side effects with long-term use, we prefer dexamethasone only when treatment for days to weeks is anticipated. For patients with longer life expectancies, megestrol acetate is more appropriate. As with any drug, potential benefits and risks need to be balanced. A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] concluded that megestrol acetate stimulated appetite in about 1 of 4 treated patients with advanced cancer and resulted in weight gain in 1 of 12 treated patients; however, it was associated with an increased risk of edema and potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of corticosteroids in CACS has not been established. Euphorigenic and antiinflammatory effects, and perhaps stimulation of orexigenic hormones within the hypothalamus, may be responsible for an increase in appetite.</p><p>At one time, corticosteroids were first-line therapy for appetite stimulation in CACS. In the first placebo-controlled trial in CACS, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> alleviated cancer anorexia on a short-term basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This finding has subsequently been replicated by other studies, and both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> have also been shown to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A reasonable dose of dexamethasone in this setting is 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> although lower doses may also be effective.</p><p>Many patients treated with corticosteroids experience an increase in appetite and sense of wellbeing but not weight gain, compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, the duration of appetite stimulation is often short-lived. Furthermore, prolonged steroid therapy produces myopathy and a wide variety of other side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Progesterone analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of prospective, controlled randomized trials and a 2013 meta-analysis of the Cochrane database have confirmed the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA) for palliation of CACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. The effectiveness of megestrol acetate and its potential superiority to other classes of agents (at least in terms of toxicity) are illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one representative trial, 133 patients with CACS were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There was a significant increase in both appetite and weight in patients treated with megestrol acetate, and 11 of 67 patients treated with megestrol acetate gained at least 15 pounds, compared with just 1 of 66 receiving a placebo in patients without clinically evident fluid accumulation. The only side effect that occurred significantly more frequently with megestrol was mild edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analogs over corticosteroids and anabolic agents were demonstrated in a trial in which 475 patients with CACS were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxymesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxymesterone</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The megestrol acetate and dexamethasone had similar efficacy in terms of appetite stimulation and weight gain, and both were superior to fluoxymesterone. However, toxicity was more common with dexamethasone (myopathy, cushingoid body habitus, and peptic acid disease), which led some patients to discontinue treatment. There was no difference between the treatment groups in survival or quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2013 Cochrane review of megestrol for anorexia-cachexia syndrome concluded that when compared with placebo, megestrol significantly improves appetite and weight, but that there is a lack of benefit when megestrol was compared with other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, edema, thromboembolic events, and deaths were more frequent in the patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>. The authors concluded that megestrol was associated with increased mortality (relative risk 1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.94), with greater risk at doses of &ge;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. However, none of the trials was designed to investigate mortality, so further research is needed to draw firm conclusions. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose of megestrol acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have addressed the optimal dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The best balance between effectiveness and toxicity is between 480 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. This was demonstrated in a dose-response trial, in which there was a positive relationship between appetite stimulation and increasing megestrol acetate doses ranging from 160 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A higher dose, 1280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> was not more effective. The above mentioned Cochrane review concluded that there was insufficient information to define the optimal dose of megestrol, but that higher doses (&gt;160 mg) were more related to weight gain than were lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. On the other hand, mortality was more frequent in patients receiving doses &ge;800 mg daily.</p><p>Most published studies tested <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> tablets rather than the oral suspension. However, the liquid form is associated with good compliance, lower expense, and possibly better bioavailability. Our practice is to begin with liquid megestrol acetate at a dose of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. A high-potency liquid formulation is available, which contains 625 mg in 5 ml.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Megestrol acetate</a> is usually well-tolerated. There may be a slight increase in the risk of edema and thromboembolic phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], particularly in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Megestrol may cause symptomatic suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In the presence of serious infection, surgery, or trauma, this complication may be life-threatening if not anticipated and treated. In male patients with cancer, treatment with megestrol may also suppress the gonadal axis, resulting in symptomatic androgen deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The benefit of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analogs has not been seen despite several prospective randomized clinical trials, as is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 243 patients with newly diagnosed, extensive-stage small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although megestrol reduced nausea somewhat, there was no improvement in tumor response rate, survival, or quality of life. An increased incidence of thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with megestrol acetate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial randomly assigned 134 patients with advanced, incurable, non-hormone-sensitive cancer to MPA (500 mg BID) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At 12 weeks, MPA was associated with improved appetite and a mean weight gain of 0.6 &plusmn; 4.4 kg compared with a mean weight loss of 1.4 &plusmn; 4.6 kg in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.04 for the between group difference).

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Progesterone analogs'</a> above.)</p><p>However, anabolic steroids may have a selective effect that induces an increase in lean body mass, even while body fat decreases and there is a decrease in overall weight. In a randomized trial presented at the 2008 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, 155 patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxandrolone</a> (10 mg twice a day for 12 weeks) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 12 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Total weight and lean body mass were assessed at the end of the 12-week treatment course and again four weeks later after a washout period. Treatment with oxandrolone was associated with perhaps a slight non-statistically significant increase in lean body mass at 12 weeks (2.67 versus 0.82 pounds with megestrol, p = 0.12), but a decrease in overall weight as compared with megestrol (-3.3 versus +5.8 pounds, respectively).

While <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span> is frequently seen in advanced cancer, it may also be a prominent feature of other end-stage, life-threatening illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Assessment and management of anorexia and cachexia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several agents of different therapeutic classes have been studied for treatment of CACS. The orexigenic agents that have been relatively well evaluated in CACS are corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analogs, cannabinoids, and serotonin antagonists. Only corticosteroids and progesterone analogs have proven benefit in palliation of the anorexia associated with this syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Appetite stimulants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A trial of a corticosteroid or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analog is reasonable in patients with CACS if they perceive CACS to be a prominent clinical problem for which they want drug therapy and understand the potential toxicities attributed to these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The primary benefits associated with these drugs are increased appetite and modest weight gain, not improved survival or quality of life. Given the short-term nature of benefit and the potential for serious side effects with long-term use, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> when treatment for only days to weeks is anticipated. For patients with longer life expectancies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> is more appropriate, but potential benefits must be balanced with risks (edema, thromboembolic events, increased mortality). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Progesterone analogs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend against the use of synthetic cannabinoids either as a single agent or in combination with megestrol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We also suggest not using inhaled marijuana for CACS given the lack of evidence supporting benefit (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a> is reasonable for patients with carcinoid syndrome who have <span class=\"nowrap\">anorexia/cachexia</span>. In other settings, efficacy has not been proven. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cyproheptadine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until further information is available from randomized trials, we suggest against the use of anabolic steroids, eicosapentaenoic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, insulin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) infusions, melatonin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, serotonin antagonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, amino acid supplements, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> for treatment of anorexia in patients with CACS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We recommend against the use of inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and hydrazine sulfate in patients with CACS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anabolic agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine and metabolic inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Insulin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'ATP infusions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Melatonin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Mirtazapine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Serotonin antagonists'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Metoclopramide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Amino acid supplements'</a> above and <a href=\"#H375560115\" class=\"local\">'Olanzapine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of combined therapy for treatment of CACS is unclear. Further studies are needed before it can be concluded that any combination of agents is safe and more effective than single-agent therapy with either a corticosteroid or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> analog. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-management-of-cancer-anorexia-cachexia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hashida H, Takabayashi A, Tokuhara T, et al.
