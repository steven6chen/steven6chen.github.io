Anal fissures cause pain, especially during a bowel movement.</p><p>There is a muscle that wraps around the anus and holds it shut. It is called the &quot;anal sphincter.&quot; The sphincter gets tense when the anus is injured. In people with anal fissures, the sphincter goes into spasms, which can lead to further injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26738995\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes anal fissures?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anal fissure is most often caused by having a hard, dry bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739012\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an anal fissure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who have an anal fissure feel a tearing, ripping, or burning pain when they have a bowel movement. This pain can last for hours. Some people also bleed slightly when they have a bowel movement. They might see bright red blood on the toilet paper or on the surface of the bowel movement. Some people with an anal fissure also have itching or irritation around the anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739029\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor or nurse if you bleed when you have a bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739046\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can check whether you have anal fissure by gently spreading your buttocks apart and looking at your anus.</p><p>If you have had bleeding, your doctor or nurse might send you for a test called a &quot;sigmoidoscopy&quot; or a similar test called a &quot;colonoscopy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58734 \">figure 2</a>). For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your anus and advances it into your colon. The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your colon and check for causes of bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739063\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to help an anal fissure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat more fiber &ndash; Eating more fiber can help keep your bowel movements soft. Fiber is found in most fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79063 \">figure 3</a>). Doctors suggest eating 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day. The nutrition label on packaged foods can show you much fiber you are getting in each serving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51585\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51585 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a stool softener &ndash; Stool softeners are medicines that help make your bowel movements easier to pass. You can buy them without a prescription. One stool softener that is often used is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">docusate</a> (sample brand name: Colace).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soak your buttocks in a &quot;sitz bath&quot; &ndash; Soaking your buttocks in 2 or 3 inches of warm water is called taking a &quot;sitz bath.&quot; Do this 2 to 3 times a day for 10 to 15 minutes. Do not add soap, bubble bath, or anything else to the water. Sitz baths help relieve pain and relax the sphincter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739080\"><span class=\"h1\">How are anal fissures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for anal fissures involves steps that are similar to the things you can do on your own.</p><p>For the first month of treatment, doctors recommend that people:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take fiber supplements, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Psyllium</a> (sample brand name: Metamucil)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methylcellulose</a> (sample brand name: Citrucel)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">polycarbophil</a> (sample brand name: FiberCon)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wheat dextran (sample brand name: Benefiber)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a stool softener, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">docusate</a> (sample brand name: Colace).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitroglycerin</a> cream, a prescription cream that relieves pain and helps the anus heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take sitz baths (see above).</p><p/><p>If these steps to do not work, doctors can try other treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin (&quot;BoTox&quot;) &ndash; This is a shot that can help the anal sphincter muscle relax and heal. It can help, but it can also cause short-term problems with leaking of gas or bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; During surgery, the doctor makes a small cut in the sphincter to help it relax. This surgery works in most patients, but doctors offer it only to people who do not get better with other treatments. Surgery can cause lasting problems with leaking of gas or bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26739163\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anal fissure (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
