It causes the tissue under the skin on the palm to thicken. Over time, this can affect the finger muscles and how the fingers move.</p><p>Dupuytren's contracture usually gets worse slowly over many years. Most often, it involves the ring finger and little finger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28679224\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Dupuytren's contracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, the tissue under the skin on the palm of the hand becomes thick. This is usually painless.</p><p>Later on, people can have other symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hard bumps (called &quot;nodules&quot;) under the skin on the palm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bands of thick tissue under the skin on the palm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger joint stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble straightening 1 or more fingers all the way (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60082 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Some people have mild symptoms and can use their hand without difficulty. Other people have severe symptoms and have trouble using their hand for everyday activities and tasks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28679239\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Dupuytren's contracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28679254\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Dupuytren's contracture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dupuytren's contracture is treated in different ways, depending on how severe the symptoms are. Treatment can't stop the condition from getting worse, but it can help reduce symptoms.</p><p>If your symptoms are mild, there are some things you can do to help keep them from getting worse. You can cushion tool handles and other items you need to grip by putting tape on them. You can also use padded gloves when you grab or hold heavy objects.</p><p>If your symptoms are severe, your doctor will talk with you about treatments to help your fingers move and straighten. All of the treatments involve removing or breaking apart the thick tissue (or bands of tissue) under the skin.</p><p>The different treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A doctor can do surgery to remove or break apart the thick tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure &ndash; A doctor can stick a needle in your palm to break apart the thick tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine &ndash; You can get a shot of medicine in your palm. The medicine softens and breaks up the thick tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation &ndash; You can get high doses of X-rays beamed into your hand.</p><p/><p>To decide which treatment is right for you, talk with your doctor about the benefits and downsides of each option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28679269\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hand pain (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
