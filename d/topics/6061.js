Products available that contain VWF in high concentrations include factor VIII concentrates, purified VWF concentrates, and cryoprecipitate. Replacement therapy should be continued for two to three days in patients who had a mucosal biopsy. For patients who underwent a therapeutic procedure, replacement should continue for up to two weeks.

Hemophilia B is less common, is also x-linked recessive, and is due to congenital factor IX deficiency. Patients with these disorders should be prepared for endoscopy as if they were having a life-threatening hemorrhage.</p><p>In patients with factor VIII deficiency, the factor VIII activity should be raised by infusion of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-human-plasma-derived-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">factor VIII concentrate</a> one hour before the procedure. Baseline and post infusion levels should be measured to determine that the response has been adequate. </p><p>Guidelines are lacking with regard to factor replacement for endoscopic procedures. However, in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, an initial factor level of 60 to 100 percent is achieved for hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A prophylactic level of 30 to 50 percent is then maintained until the wound has healed (typically 10 to 14 days). </p><p>The principles are the same for patients with factor IX deficiency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ACQUIRED DISORDERS OF HEMOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal failure, liver failure, and thrombocytopenia may all predispose to procedure-related bleeding. von Willebrand disease can also exist in an acquired form.

This is most often manifested by skin hemorrhage and by bleeding at sites of surgery or trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-dysfunction-in-uremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet dysfunction in uremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uremic bleeding appears to correlate most closely with prolongation of the bleeding time, due primarily to impaired platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Other coagulation parameters are generally intact in uremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The platelet count is usually normal or only slightly reduced, and there is no prolongation of the prothrombin or partial thromboplastin times.</p><p>The risk of bleeding with gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures cannot be accurately predicted from the bleeding time, and there are relatively few data to guide optimal treatment to prevent bleeding. As a general rule, patients should be treated as though their risk of bleeding is increased, and preventive measures should be guided by the clinical situation. Options for improving platelet function include DDAVP, dialysis, estrogens, and correction of anemia, which are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-dysfunction-in-uremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet dysfunction in uremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with liver failure have a number of derangements in hemostasis.

Low fibrinogen levels may be due to the presence of structurally abnormal fibrinogen, increased fibrinolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patients may also have thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet dysfunction (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Thrombocytopenia'</a> below). Administration of DDAVP may be beneficial in patients with qualitative platelet dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the liver makes coagulation factors as well as anticoagulant proteins, liver disease can lead to a hypocoagulable state or a hypercoagulable state. The relative balance or imbalance of these factors is not reflected in conventional indices of coagulation, such as the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or international normalized ratio (INR). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Effects of hepatic dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Because conventional indices of coagulation are not helpful in determining a patient's bleeding risk, patients who require an invasive procedure that is at moderate or high risk for bleeding may need additional testing, such as a determination of fibrinogen levels, thromboelastography, or thromboelastometry to guide management. This approach needs further study before being recommended as routine pre-procedure assessment of bleeding risk. In general, in patients with liver disease, procedure-related bleeding risk cannot be assessed accurately pre-procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While plasma is commonly given to patients with chronic liver disease and an elevated INR prior to invasive procedures, plasma infusion may have adverse effects on portal vein pressures and collateral vessel flow. In addition, the traditional dose of two units of plasma is unlikely to significantly alter coagulation factor levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Plasma products'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Common clinical problems'</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with chronic liver disease who require an invasive procedure may depend on factors such as fibrinogen levels and global assays of hemostasis (eg, thromboelastography, or thromboelastometry). This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H166552210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Invasive procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No large prospective studies have established optimal strategies for giving prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with thrombocytopenia.

In a retrospective series of 395 patients with platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">75,000/microL</span> who underwent 617 endoscopic procedures, the risk of bleeding following biopsy was 1.5 percent (6 of 398 endoscopies) and following polypectomy was 4 percent (2 of 45 polypectomies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
