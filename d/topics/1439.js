Organ transplantation procedures were first performed in adults in the 1950s and in children in the 1960s. Since then, advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapies have led to a marked increase in successful transplantation of organs and patient survival.</p><p>Unfortunately, many individuals continue to die while waiting for a needed organ because of the increasing gap between donors and recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is particularly true in children where size and weight constraints, technical challenges of transplantation in smaller children, and organ supply and organ demand issues continue to exist. Obstacles to recovery of organs from donors include: family or cultural resistance to organ donation, issues related to authorization or consent of families (including inappropriate timing and confusion regarding death of their child), medical staff perceptions and misunderstanding about organ donation, missed opportunities for donation (including medical examiner denials in child abuse cases), and inadequate donor management resulting in loss of viable organs for transplantation.</p><p>There has been a substantial reduction in donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD), also referred to as &quot;brain dead&quot; or &quot;standard criteria&quot; donors (SCD), in the last decade in the United Kingdom and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The decline in donors exists for several reasons. Morbidity and mortality in children has been reduced from improved medical therapies, eradication of life-threatening diseases including antibiotic therapies, more effective immunizations, use and refinement of passenger safety restraint systems, helmets, and other safety measures. Additionally, care provided by specialists trained in pediatric intensive care has significantly improved chances for survival of children with life-threatening disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adverse publicity associated with reports of unauthorized or inappropriate use of organs may have also contributed to families and loved ones denying consent for donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The increasing gap between organ availability and recipient need has resulted in more people dying while waiting for a needed organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], making it a necessity to maximize the recovery of organs from the existing donor pool. Therefore, the option of donation should be preserved for all families facing end-of-life issues with their child. Decisions about organ donation are influenced by individual factors as well as cultural beliefs. When approached in a sensitive manner, most families report that organ donation is a &quot;positive experience&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>The assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation is discussed in this chapter. The determination of death by neurologic criteria and management of the potential organ donor are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential pediatric organ donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1086342983\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3087094731\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent vegetative state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a persistent vegetative state (PVS), the brainstem remains intact and functions to maintain respiratory effort and normal circulation, while the patient's cortical function has been significantly impaired or lost. In this state, the patient may or may not have an awareness of self or environment. These patients cannot be declared legally dead because their brainstem function remains intact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715552456\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic death (brain death)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fundamental definition of neurologic death is similar in most countries, although the procedures required to establish the diagnosis vary. Countries such as the United States and Canada require specific physical examination criteria to determine death of the entire brain, including the brainstem. If examination criteria cannot be met, ancillary studies are required to determine death by neurologic criteria. This differs from the United Kingdom, where only testing of brainstem reflexes is required to determine death. Additionally, in the United States, two examinations separated by an observation period are required for children. The observation period depends on the age of the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The diagnosis of neurologic death, including considerations related to the pediatric patient, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In this topic review, we will use the term &quot;neurologic death&quot; to describe the condition meeting the legal and medical definitions for death based on the region of practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3798771538\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An organ donor who is declared dead by neurologic criteria with intact circulatory function is known as a &quot;brain dead donor.&quot; In the United States, they are also known as &quot;deceased donor&quot; or &quot;standard criteria donor (SCD),&quot; because this is the most common type of donor. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1424602446\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) refers to a donor that does not meet criteria for brain death, but has no hope of any sort of meaningful neurologic recovery, and in whom the family chooses to withdraw life-sustaining treatment. After death is determined using circulatory criteria (permanent absence of respiration, circulation, and responsiveness), organs may be recovered for transplantation. This type of donation has previously been referred to as non heart-beating organ donation (NHBD), or donation after cardiac death (DCD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential deceased donor&quot;, section on 'Donation after death determined using circulatory criteria (DCD)'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H866031524\"><span class=\"h2\">When to consult the Organ Procurement Organization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early referral to the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) is a crucial part of the donation process and should generally occur before neurologic or circulatory death has formally been declared. No assumptions about donor suitability should be made until discussions with the OPO have occurred. Decisions regarding organ recovery are made by the OPO and their medical director, not by the medical team managing the potential donor. Consultation with the OPO should be considered for a critically ill child as soon as specific clinical triggers are met.</p><p>Appropriate clinical triggers for consulting the OPO include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival seems unlikely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placing orders for limited advanced care (eg, limitation or de-escalation of care, or comfort measures only)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation of a do not resuscitate (DNR) order</p><p/><p>Donation should be viewed as a process. Early referral is an important part of successful donation and is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The discussion between the clinician and the OPO can help determine whether the patient may be a suitable donor. Early involvement of the OPO can optimize the chance of organ recovery, and can also spare the family the discouraging news that their child cannot be a donor because of an underlying disease process, unsuitable organs, or lack of recipients to receive a transplanted organ. Most OPOs have personnel that can facilitate communication with the family along with the critical care team. The OPO also provides experience and support independent of the decision to donate, during the time period of donation or withdrawal of ventilatory support. Even if solid organs are not suitable for recovery, tissue donation, including eyes, skin, bone, and heart valves may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688028760\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is imperative to discuss each potential donor with the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO). No assumptions about donor suitability should be made until discussions with the OPO have occurred, because there has been a progressive expansion in the types of donors and organs recovered for transplantation over the last two decades. Decisions regarding organ recovery are made by the OPO and their medical director, not by the medical team managing the potential donor. </p><p>Patients declared dead by neurologic criteria (donation after neurologic determination of death, DNDD) remain the most common source of organs for transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75152 \">table 1</a>), although there has been resurgence in organ donation following circulatory death. These patients are cared for in an intensive care unit, where vital functions are artificially maintained using assisted ventilation and, in some cases, inotropic support and hormonal replacement therapy following irreversible brain damage. Following identification of the patient as a potential donor and the determination of neurologic death, aggressive intensive medical care must be continued to ensure that donor organs remain viable for transplantation. Such care provides a better graft to the transplant recipient and can markedly enhance long-term organ survival in the recipient and increase the chance of recovering suitable organs from potential donors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential pediatric organ donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ideal donor for DNDD has an isolated head injury, with limited or no other organ system dysfunction or pre-existing comorbid diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Patients with multi-system organ failure due to trauma, toxic drug ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], sepsis and even primary brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], who may not be ideal candidates for donation initially, can be aggressively managed following declaration of neurologic death and potentially provide additional organs for transplantation. Although the majority of such patients are already in intensive care units, patients admitted to the emergency department may also be potential candidates for organ donation, and early notification to the OPO should be encouraged.</p><p>The organ donor should ideally meet all of the following criteria. Not all of these criteria are absolute, and the OPO's input is essential: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic death for the (DNDD donor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of any serious infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free of malignancy with the exception of low-grade skin or brain tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free of systemic disease (eg, systemic lupus or end-stage renal disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically stable (even with inotropic and pressor use)</p><p/><p>Contraindications to organ donation include active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, and active or uncontrolled malignancies. Other disease processes, such as infectious illnesses or risk factors for these diseases also are strong contraindications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54994 \">table 2</a>). Risk factors for HIV infection, such as intravenous drug use make the donor a high-risk candidate and may exclude a patient from becoming a donor; however, this is not commonly encountered in children. </p><p>Novel strategies are emerging to help increase the supply of organs needed for transplantation into critically ill patients. As examples: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was formally a contraindication to organ donation, however, changes in the United States are allowing HIV positive organs to be transplanted to HIV-positive recipients through the HIV Organ Policy Equity ACT (HOPE Act). Donation from hepatitis B and C positive patients may be considered for recipients who are already infected with the same virus, or in exceptional circumstances, for recipients at risk of imminent death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Isolated liver disease or end stage heart disease in the donor precludes transplantation of these damaged organs. However, disease affecting one organ should not prevent recovery of other organs, unless the disease process causes or would predispose to widespread organ failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILY COMMUNICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a child is dying or has died, the healthcare team should explain this clearly to the family in a caring, compassionate, and sympathetic manner. The attending physician and the critical care nurses who have been involved in the patient's ante-mortem management should meet directly with the family in a quiet environment that is free of distractions. Involvement of palliative care physicians is a valuable asset, and utilizing chaplain and social services can also provide additional support for the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. With the onset and declaration of neurologic death, the support and care offered to families should be intensified rather than withdrawn. &#160;</p><p>Early and continued involvement of the OPO is essential in the discussions of organ donation with families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. In the United States, hospitals participating in government-funded programs are mandated to refer all potential organ donors to their local OPO, and to inform families of their option to donate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Each unit should have a policy that outlines a strategy for communication and support with families of potential donors. Such policies are ideally developed by a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of medical staff, nursing personnel, psychologists, child life specialists, chaplain services, OPO personnel, and family service coordinators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>].</p><p>Parents should be allowed adequate time to grieve and accept the reality of the child's death or impending death. Ideally, the discussion of organ donation should not be raised during the same discussions about death, unless the issue is raised by the family. The separation of the two discussions, described as &quot;decoupling,&quot; has been shown to increase the chance of a positive decision by the family regarding donation for adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]; however, this may not always be the case with children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Importantly, parents respond positively if they are exposed to organ donation information prior to the child's death, and have time to discuss donation among themselves before the death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Offering the parents opportunity of organ donation should become part of the end of life care in all intensive care units.</p><p>When entering the discussion of organ donation, the clinician's main role is to communicate that the child has died and to ensure that the family understands the finality of neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. A common reason for parents to deny consent for donation is lack of acceptance of their child's death. Ensuring that the parents understand that their child is dying or has died is an imperative message that must be consistently conveyed by the healthcare team. Team members must collaborate with physicians in using consistent, uncomplicated terminology. The medical and legal definition of neurologic death is complex and often confusing even for physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], and families do not tend to make a distinction between circulatory and neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, it may be helpful to use general terms such as &quot;death&quot; when possible, rather than &quot;brain death&quot; or &quot;neurologic death&quot;. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the family has authorized donation (either for donation after neurologic determination of death [DNDD] or donation after circulatory determination of death [DCDD]), laboratory evaluation of the potential donor continues with both general and organ specific testing. These screening tests differ from center to center. The goals are to determine tissue type and basic donor immunology, assess organ function, and identify any underlying infection or contraindication to donation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54890 \">table 3</a>). Laboratory testing generally includes ABO blood type, complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), human immunodeficiency virus antibody (anti-HIV), serologic tests for syphilis (VDRL or RPR), and cytomegalovirus antibody (anti-CMV). </p><p>The evaluation and decision about whether to recover an organ from a potential donor will be directed by the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) and transplant surgeons, based upon organ function, disease process, and underlying circumstances that resulted in the death of the donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific organ considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General considerations for donor selection for liver transplantation, including the components of the evaluation by the organ procurement organization, donor exclusion criteria and ABO matching are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-donor-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Donor selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of the potential donor for liver recovery frequently includes the following studies: Serum albumin, PT, and PTT provide an index of liver synthetic function, but may be affected by administration of blood products or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Additionally, anoxia or the cause of donor death may compromise liver function. If the AST, ALT, and GGT normalize after resuscitation, the liver may be suitable for transplantation. Organs from donors with serologic evidence of viral hepatitis may also be appropriate for transplantation under special conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-donor-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Donor selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General considerations for donor selection for kidney transplantation, including the components of the evaluation by the organ procurement organization, donor exclusion criteria and ABO matching, and the kidney allocation policy in the United States, are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organ-sharing-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organ sharing in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Assessment of the potential donor for kidney recovery includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine &ndash; Ideal donors generally have relatively normal serum creatinine levels. Elevated creatinine levels may be a predictor of poor graft function, and require further evaluation to determine renal function. However, kidneys with impaired renal function from acute tubular necrosis have been transplanted successfully with recovery of renal function following transplantation. The recipient may require temporary support with dialysis following transplantation until renal function recovers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis and urine culture &ndash; A urinalysis is also important to assess for casts and protein excretion and presence of infection. A urine culture is also sent prior to organ recovery. In some cases a renal ultrasound is performed to evaluate the anatomy; ultrasound of the donor kidneys is not routine unless an anatomic variant is suspected. </p><p/><p>Intrinsic renal disease and parenchymal trauma are exclusion criteria for donation. Risk factors for graft failure include technical issues during implantation, degree of immune sensitivity in the recipient, and pre-recovery organ injury (eg, ischemia and hypoxia); these apply to donors of all ages. The benefits of living donor transplantation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Kidneys from donors younger than three years are sometimes discarded because there is an increased risk of graft thrombosis, however, the <em>en bloc</em> technique, in which both kidneys are recovered together and transplanted with the vascular pedicle, has been used with good success rates in small adult recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The high risk of vascular complications limits the use of this procedure in children, however, technical advances are allowing <em>en bloc</em> kidneys to be transplanted with improved success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Renal mass must be adequate for the size of the recipient, and is a predictor of graft failure, so kidneys from small pediatric donors should be allocated first to recipients of similar weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Each case must be discussed with the transplant surgeon to determine if the kidneys will meet the need of the potential recipient (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;, section on 'Inadequate renal mass'</a>). Use of therapeutic hypothermia in deceased organ donor to enhance delayed graft function has not been evaluated in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donor selection for potential cardiac recovery is particularly stringent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. There should be no history of pre-existing coronary or valvular disease. Inotropic support should be minimized, and adjusted to maintain a normal blood pressure for age. Increased need for inotropic support with concomitant lactic acidosis may indicate poor cardiac performance and requires careful evaluation for the causes of dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential pediatric organ donor&quot;, section on 'Inotropes and vasopressors'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to recover and transplant a heart from a potential donor will be made by the OPO and transplant surgeon based upon organ function, size, disease process, and underlying circumstances that resulted in the death of the donor, just like any other potential organ for transplantation. Organ assessment in intensive care includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12 lead EKG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac enzymes (troponin and CK-MB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac angiography (in selected cases)</p><p/><p>The echocardiogram should be performed after stabilization of the donor. Echocardiograms performed immediately following neurologic death will likely have evidence of dysfunction and ischemic changes related to the catecholamine storm and hypertension that ensues prior to brainstem herniation. In the older child, a pulmonary artery catheter may be requested to further define cardiac function.</p><p>Cardiac size may limit transplantation for the potential recipient to accept the donated organ. In some cases it might be reasonable to transplant a smaller heart into a bigger person. The converse (transplanting a bigger heart into a smaller person) occasionally is also possible, such as when the recipient has a longstanding cardiomyopathy with a relatively large heart size. Specific measurements will be conducted to determine if the heart is the appropriate size for the recipient.</p><p>The surgeon, with background knowledge of the hemodynamic parameters, performs the final assessment of ventricular function visually during the organ recovery procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organ assessment in the intensive care unit requires:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen challenge test and serial arterial blood gas analysis &ndash; To determine whether the patient's lungs are suitable for organ donation, an oxygen challenge is performed. The potential donor is preoxygenated with an FiO2 of 1.0, and PaO2 is measured. If the PaO2 is &gt;300 mmHg, the lungs are considered suitable for donation in many centers. Values lower than this threshold suggest lung injury, infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atelectasis. Because low values may be caused by atelectasis, alveolar recruitment may be achieved by strategies to improve oxygenation. Serial analysis of arterial blood gas between oxygen challenge tests provides further information about respiratory function and response to interventions.

This is usually based on donor and recipient height, although some centers also use estimates of lung volume made from chest radiographs. Lobar transplantation or reduction of the lung size by surgical stapling has been reported for pediatric recipients when donor lung size is excessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

Donor lung injury occurs after brain-stem death due to hemodynamic instability, neurogenic edema and hormonal changes, and this can impair graft function in the recipient. In a retrospective study, early lung retrieval from traumatic brain dead donors did not compromise outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Lungs from donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) donors are being recovered and transplanted with good success in adults. Success of these DCDD organs is in part because lungs from this type of donor have not been subjected to the hemodynamic, neurologic, and hormonal changes associated with neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Criteria defining the ideal characteristics of a lung donor include are an age less than 60 years, a normal chest radiograph, good gas exchange, and no history of either primary pulmonary disease, aspiration, or cardiopulmonary surgery. Relative and absolute exclusion criteria are discussed in detail separately.

In the United States, the Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative initiated in 2003 has significantly increased rates of organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These initiatives have resulted in more organs being recovered and transplanted in children over the past 10 years, with a significant decrease in children dying while awaiting an organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These statistics do not include other children who are removed from the waiting list because their condition deteriorates and they become too sick to transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512387661\"><span class=\"h2\">Organizational and educational initiatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important elements of the strategy include placing hospital-based organ procurement coordinators within active donor hospitals, encouragement of early involvement of the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) in the donation process, and collaboration with intensive care specialists. For pediatric donation, collaboration between OPO coordinators and pediatric intensivists is particularly crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In the United States donor registries have been established, which allow healthy individuals express their intent to donate their organs after death. Authorization for donation in children must be obtained from parents or a surrogate. Ongoing education about donation with families and loved ones is essential so a decision is made before a tragic event which can create more stress when a family is faced with making decisions about end-of-life care and donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after circulatory determination of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large proportion of the increase in donors is due to the use of donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) (see <a href=\"#H1424602446\" class=\"local\">'Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD)'</a> above). While most donated organs still come from donors declared dead by neurologic criteria (also known as standard criteria donors, SCD), the use of organs from DCDD donors has substantially increased the supply of organs available for pediatric and adult recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. </p><p>Graft survival of DCDD organs are similar to organs recovered from DNDD donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/5,43,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,43,49-51</a>]. The ethics of transplantation of organs from DCDD donors has been considered and supported by many societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/11,12,47,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,47,52-54</a>]. Most children's hospitals in the United States have developed policies regarding DCDD, but there is considerable variation among these policies regarding procedures and personnel for declaring death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Although few organs are recovered from DCDD donors at any one institution, the total number from all children's hospitals could substantially increase the number of organs available for transplantation. </p><p>DCDD requires close collaboration with the OPO to determine donor suitability, which includes estimated time to circulatory arrest and recovery of organs (warm ischemic time). Often, withdrawal of life sustaining medical therapies is done in the operating room or in the perioperative area to minimize organ ischemic time. It is important to recognize that the timing of circulatory death following withdrawal of medical therapies for DCDD is very unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Families should be made aware of the possibility that donation may not be possible if circulatory death does not occur within a specified time period. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3661480384\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal donation is another promising approach that may increase the number of organs available for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Historically, there were concerns about establishing &quot;brain death&quot; in the neonate. However, one study suggested that determination of brain death could be made on clinical evaluation only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], and the revised pediatric brain death guidelines in the United States state that brain death can be determined in infants 37 weeks estimated gestational age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Infants younger than 37 weeks gestation were excluded since no experience to determine brain death in this age group exists. Cerebral edema or intracranial bleeding normally leads to severe neurological injury in the newborn and very rarely causes brain death. Withdrawal of life sustaining medical therapies is the more predominant mode of death on neonatal ICUs.</p><p>Organ recovery from neonatal DCDD donors to increase the pool of organs for transplantation is increasing. One study observed that 8 percent of neonatal intensive care units (NICU) deaths were potentially appropriate for DCDD organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Another study also concluded that recovery from neonatal DCD donors are an important source of transplantable organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. <em>En bloc</em> kidney recovery from small pediatric donors is being increasingly attempted (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Kidneys'</a> above), and the possibility of <em>en bloc</em> kidney transplantation from neonatal donors has also been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Procurement of other organs has been more contentious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Hearts recovered from neonatal DCDD donors have been transplanted with good success in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Liver cells are being recovered from DCDD donors and are being used in clinical trials for liver cell therapy for congenital metabolic disorders of the liver in children. Other possible candidates for DCDD donation include anencephalic infants. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ transplantation has become the treatment of choice for end-stage organ failure in carefully selected individuals, but many candidates die while waiting for a needed organ because of the increasing gap between the numbers of donors and recipients. This is particularly true for children, for whom size and weight constraints place additional burden on finding suitable organs for transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most organs used for transplantation continue to come from donation after neurologic determination death (DNDD), also known as standard criteria donors (SCD). However, more organs are being recovered from donors who have died after meeting criteria for donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD). Neonatal donation is another area of growth that is providing more needed organs for children. (See <a href=\"#H1086342983\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Donation after circulatory determination of death'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3661480384\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal donation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early identification and management of the potential donor increases the likelihood of successful recovery of organs for transplantation. The process ideally requires a specialized team led by pediatric intensivists, in close consultation with the local Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) and transplant physicians and surgeons. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Donor identification and selection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ donation is an important part of end-of-life care. Families of all potential donors should be given the opportunity of organ donation. Donation is a decision made by the family, not by the medical team. The care team should provide support for the grieving family and communicate clear messages about the finality of neurologic death, using sensitivity and simple terms. Assistance from palliative care physicians can provide another valuable resource during end-of-life care. The opportunity of organ donation should be preserved and should be a separate discussion from withdrawal of life sustaining medical therapies, unless the parents initiate a conversation regarding donation prior to determination of death. Early involvement of the OPO and transplant coordinators can facilitate effective communication and family support. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Family communication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation of the potential donor is performed to determine tissue type and basic donor serology, assess organ function, and identify any underlying infection or contraindications to donation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54890 \">table 3</a>). No assumptions about donor suitability should be made until discussions with the OPO have occurred. Pediatric donors are subject to additional organ-specific size considerations.
