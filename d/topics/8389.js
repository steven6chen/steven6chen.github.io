The scrotum is the skin sac that holds the testicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55941 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Hydroceles are common in newborn baby boys. They usually go away by the time the baby is 1 year old. Older boys and adult men can also get hydroceles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868408\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a hydrocele?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hydrocele usually does not cause symptoms, except when it gets very large. When it does, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or discomfort in the scrotum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling as though the scrotum is heavy or full</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or irritation in the skin around the scrotum</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868423\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a hydrocele?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light test &ndash; Your doctor can shine a powerful light on the area of your scrotum where there is a swelling. If the light passes through, it means nothing solid is blocking the light. The fluid in a hydrocele does not block the light, so if the light goes through that, it is good proof that the swelling is a hydrocele.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body. An ultrasound can tell the doctor if you have a hydrocele or a different condition.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868440\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a hydrocele treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what caused the hydrocele and what symptoms it causes. Treatment is not always necessary. Some hydroceles go away on their own. Depending on your age, symptoms, and type of hydrocele, you might not need treatment.</p><p>If a baby has a hydrocele that does not go away by age 1, he will probably need surgery to remove the fluid or the sac that holds it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868455\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicocele-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Varicocele (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
