This topic will review androgen production in pre- and postmenopausal women, the possible consequences of androgen deficiency, and the effects of androgen therapy in postmenopausal women. A more detailed discussion of the diagnosis and management of female sexual dysfunction, specifically, female sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal</span> disorder (formerly referred to as hypoactive sexual desire disorder), is found separately.

Though abundant in the circulation, DHEAS, DHEA, and androstenedione may be considered pro-hormones, requiring conversion to testosterone or DHT to express their androgenic effects. DHT is the main intracellular androgen.</p><p>Androgens are produced in the adrenal gland, the ovary, and from the peripheral conversion of pro-hormones.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DHEAS, although a weak androgen, is the most abundant androgen. It is produced solely by the adrenal gland at a rate of 3.5 to 20 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Circulating levels are in the range of 75 to 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (2 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DHEA is also produced in the adrenal gland (50 percent), the ovary (20 percent), and from peripheral conversion of DHEAS (30 percent), with total production rates of 6 to 8 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Serum DHEA concentrations range from 0.2 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (7 to 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. DHEA is converted to DHEAS in the adrenal, liver, and intestines (which contain a sulfotransferase).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the adrenal glands and peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue, small amounts of DHEA and DHEAS are converted to more active androgens such as androstenedione, androstenediol, testosterone, and 5-dihydrotestosterone, and estrogens such as estradiol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a>. These hormones then exert their usual androgenic and estrogenic effects via the androgen and estrogen receptors, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androstenedione production is split equally between the adrenal gland and the ovary. Daily rates of production are 1.4 to 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and circulating levels are in the range of 160 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (5.6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone is synthesized in the adrenal gland (25 percent), the ovary (25 percent), and from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione (50 percent). Daily production rates in women are in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> compared with 5 to 7 mg a day in men, and circulating levels are between 20 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (0.7 to 2.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> with the lowest concentrations found during the early follicular phase followed by a 20 percent increase at midcycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nearly all (99 percent) of circulating testosterone is protein-bound (mainly to sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, any impact on SHBG concentration (eg, oral estrogen-mediated increase in SHBG) affects the concentration of <span class=\"nowrap\">free/active</span> testosterone. SHBG normally decreases after menopause, at least partially due to the decline in serum estradiol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DHT is largely an intracellular androgen. DHT is produced within target cells by the 5-alpha reduction of testosterone. DHT acts within the cell, and little DHT re-enters the circulation; hence, the serum concentration is relatively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of age and menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies show that serum androgen concentrations (total and free testosterone, androstenedione) gradually decline in women of reproductive age, with no further decrease after clinical menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>The secretion and serum concentrations of both DHEA and its sulfate decrease markedly with age from the third decade onward, so that in 70 to 80-year-olds, serum concentrations of both are about 20 percent of those in persons 20 to 30 years old (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73628\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73628 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. In women, this decline is accompanied by a substantial fall in urinary 17-ketosteroid (17-KS) excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73628\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73628 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The vast majority of evidence, with the exception of one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], suggests that the postmenopausal ovary continues to be an important source of androgen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/14-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-25</a>] but not estrogen production. Ovarian testosterone production remains relatively constant after natural menopause, thereby increasing the relative ovarian contribution to overall testosterone production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These observations are substantiated by the larger ovarian-to-peripheral serum gradient of testosterone in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and by the 40 to 50 percent decrease in serum testosterone concentration seen after oophorectomy in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The relatively high rate of androgen production in the postmenopausal ovary is due to the increase in gonadotropin secretion, which stimulates steroidogenesis in ovarian hilar cells or luteinized stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Ovarian stromal tissue has receptors for both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>], and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates androstenedione, estradiol, and progesterone secretion by isolated ovarian cortical stromal and hilar cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In addition, postmenopausal women given hCG have a small increase in serum testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but not estradiol, concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC ROLE OF ANDROGENS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523297363\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgens play a critical role in male reproductive development and function, but their role in female reproduction is less clear. In addition to providing the substrate for estrogen synthesis during follicular development, studies have shown the importance of appropriate androgen balance, as both androgen excess and androgen deficiency are associated with abnormalities in follicular development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In addition, some data suggest a role for androgens in prevention of follicular atresia and promotion of follicle growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523297369\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has also been proposed that androgens play a role in female sexual function, but the magnitude of the role is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The assertion that low androgen levels play a role in female sexual function is based upon the known role of androgens in male sexuality as well as clinical trials of exogenous testosterone in postmenopausal women in which supraphysiologic doses exerted a positive influence on some aspects of female sexuality. In addition, in women with hypopituitarism, clinical trial data have reported benefits in sexual function in women with both corticotropin (ACTH) and gonadotropin deficiency, but only when serum testosterone concentration was increased to the upper limit of normal for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism#H151093784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;, section on 'Androgen replacement'</a>.)</p><p>However, in studies that measure serum hormone levels and sexual function in women, the correlation between androgen concentrations and sexual function is weak. In addition, women with hyperandrogenism (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]) do not exhibit beneficial sexual effects (although women with severe hyperandrogenism from ovarian or adrenal androgen-secreting tumors sometimes experience intrusive sexual thoughts).

These possible effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse cardiovascular effects &ndash; In women, androgens have been thought to be atherogenic, largely based upon on the higher rates of cardiovascular disease in men compared to women and the possible higher risk in women with androgen excess (eg, PCOS) compared to normal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Women with PCOS are more likely to have lower HDL, higher triglycerides, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and an increase in small dense LDL particles when compared with women of similar body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance without PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>].

In women, estrogen is the primary sex steroid regulator of bone (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis#H15652976\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Estrogen'</a>). Low serum androgen concentrations have been associated with lower bone density and an increase in fracture risk in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>], but an effect of exogenous testosterone on bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture risk has not been demonstrated.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that serum androgen concentrations (total and free testosterone, androstenedione) gradually decline in women of reproductive age, with no further decrease after clinical menopause. The secretion and serum concentrations of both DHEA and its sulfate decrease markedly with age from the third decade onward, so that in 70 to 80-year-olds, serum concentrations of both are about 20 percent of those in persons 20 to 30 years old. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Androgen production'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, which suggests against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency because of the lack of both a well-defined clinical syndrome and age-based normative data for serum testosterone and free testosterone concentrations. That said, there are a number of conditions that may represent androgen deficiency syndromes, including bilateral oophorectomy, primary adrenal insufficiency, and hypopituitarism, particularly in women with both corticotropin (ACTH) and gonadotropin deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Androgen deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a short trial (six months initially) of testosterone <strong>only </strong>for postmenopausal women (natural menopause or bilateral oophorectomy) with a diagnosis of female sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal</span> disorder (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H470432367\" class=\"local\">'Sexual function'</a> above). This approach is consistent with the Endocrine Society&rsquo;s Clinical Practice Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women. Practical aspects of testosterone use, including monitoring, are reviewed separately.
