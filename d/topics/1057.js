Patients with the APS may display a constellation of clinical features including venous and arterial thrombosis, recurrent fetal losses, and thrombocytopenia. This disorder is referred to as the primary APS when it occurs alone; however, it can also be found in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), other rheumatic diseases, and certain infections and drugs.</p><p>Types of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that have been characterized include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies causing a false-positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus anticoagulants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I</p><p/><p>There appears to be a relationship between the isotype and titer of aPL and the risk of thrombotic events. Higher titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) aPL, for example, have been reported to be associated with a greater incidence of thrombotic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The kidney is one of the organs that can be compromised in patients with aPL. Renal complications directly resulting from thrombotic events associated with these antibodies include glomerular disease, large vessel renal involvement, and coagulation problems relating to dialysis and renal transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>].</p><p>The pathology, manifestations, and treatment of renal involvement in patients with APS are presented here.

In a retrospective study of 160 patients who were diagnosed with primary APS, renal involvement (defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [124 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria &gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with or without hematuria) was identified in 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Ten of the 14 patients had a renal biopsy that showed membranous nephropathy (n = 4), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (n = 2), TMA (n = 2), and vascular lesions consistent with chronic antiphospholipid nephropathy (n = 2). Both patients who had diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis developed full-blown lupus 13 and 18 years after the diagnosis of primary APS. At a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (range 6.9 to 14 years), none of the patients with membranous nephropathy had developed clinical evidence of lupus, although it is possible that lupus-related signs or symptoms were suppressed by immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease in antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with lupus and aPL commonly have a history of systemic thromboses, fetal loss, neurologic disorders, and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/1,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,20</a>]. In patients with lupus, the principal laboratory features that correlate with the presence of high titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) aPL are thrombocytopenia, the presence of a false-positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis (fluorescent treponemal antibody [FTA] negative), and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/1,8,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,21</a>]. Renal disease in this setting may result from microthrombi <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deposits of immune complexes.</p><p>Isolated microangiopathic thrombosis is a relatively unusual finding in patients with APS and lupus. Only approximately 10 percent of such patients in whom renal biopsies are performed show glomerular microthromboses as the major<strong> </strong>histopathologic finding. Nevertheless, aPL can cause significant renal damage in patients with lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These histologic and clinical features are similar to those with the APS alone or those with lupus-like features in whom the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are not fulfilled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>To better address the relationships among thrombi, aPL, renal dysfunction, and traditional lupus nephritis, a retrospective study evaluated the findings on renal biopsy in 114 patients with SLE and kidney dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In a review of 111 patients with lupus nephritis who were followed for a mean of almost 15 years and were tested regularly for aCL and lupus anticoagulant, the overall prevalence of aPL was 26 percent. aPL occurred more frequently in patients with membranous lupus (50 versus 22 percent with other lesions).</p><p>It is important to document the presence of glomerular microthromboses in patients with the APS and SLE since the therapy for microthrombi differs from the immunosuppression required for immune complex-mediated lupus nephritis. Such thrombi often recanalize in the absence of an inflammatory infiltrate and in the absence of immune deposits on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy.</p><p>Little is known concerning the relationship between aPL and the overall risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). A prospective, long-term study (median follow-up of 167 months) evaluated 111 patients with lupus nephritis, of whom 29 had aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have found that patients on maintenance hemodialysis have a high prevalence of aPL, a finding associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. In one study, for example, aPL were present in 31 percent of 97 hemodialysis patients (the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies [aCL] in 17 and 16 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The frequency of vascular access thrombosis was much higher in the patients with aPL, as measured by the lupus anticoagulant (62 versus 26 percent in those without these antibodies). Similar findings were noted in another report in which a significant increase in the odds of having two or more episodes of arteriovenous (AV) graft thrombosis was found among the patients with raised aPL titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The incidence of aPL may vary with the type of hemodialysis access used. This was suggested in a cross-sectional study that evaluated hemodialysis patients at a single dialysis facility: 22 percent of 74 patients with AV grafts had a raised titer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) aPL versus only 1 of 17 patients (6 percent) with AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Whether AV grafts induce aPL or patients with aPL require AV grafts could not be determined.</p><p>The experience at one major medical center lends further support to these findings. In a review of 230 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titers of IgG aPL were elevated in 26 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titers of immunoglobulin M (IgM) aPL were elevated in 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titers of both antibodies were elevated in 3 percent</p><p/><p>The mean time to AV graft failure was significantly decreased in the group with elevated IgG antibodies, even though there was no difference in AV fistula clotting between those with and without high IgG antibody titers.</p><p>There does not appear to be an association between the development of aPL and age, gender, or dialysis duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the incidence of such antibodies appears to correlate positively with the type of dialysis modality as well as the use of dialysis since a much lower incidence of aPL has been found both in patients with renal insufficiency in whom dialytic support is not yet required and in those treated with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial number of renal transplant recipients have circulating aPL, which can damage the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 178 transplant recipients, 28 percent had aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Compared with patients without such antibodies, these individuals had a significantly higher incidence of arterial (18 versus 6 percent, p&lt;0.001) and venous (8 versus 2 percent, p&lt;0.001) thrombosis; testing of pretransplant sera revealed that the aPL were present prior to the operation in 85 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second retrospective series, which evaluated transplant recipients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also found a high incidence of significant thrombotic events among those with aPL (60 versus 8 percent in patients without these antibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>Although suggestive, these retrospective observations cannot prove causality. Another retrospective study, for example, reported no increased incidence in allograft loss or reduction in glomerular filtration rate among the 61 of 337 patients with positive aCL. In this study, there was increased use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in those with positive antibodies (20 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, early allograft loss was observed in two of five patients with very high aCL titers who were not being anticoagulated.</p><p>In addition to systemic thrombotic events, a renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) may be observed in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected renal transplant recipients with aCL. This association was suggested in a report of 18 anti-HCV-positive patients, five of whom developed renal TMA between 5 and 120 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. aPL were found in all five of these patients but in only 1 of the 13 without a microangiopathy. The hypothesis that aCL, HCV infection, and renal thrombosis were correlated was supported by the observation that normal aCL titers were found in the seven HCV-negative transplant recipients who presented with renal <span class=\"nowrap\">TMA/hemolytic-uremic</span> syndrome during the same time period and served as a control group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of the patient with APS is generally the same whether or not renal disease is present. Many patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) do not experience thrombotic events or have evidence of renal thrombosis. Indiscriminate anticoagulation of such patients would therefore place a large population at risk for bleeding to achieve a dubious benefit. In contrast, patients with evidence of venous or arterial thromboembolic disease, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the glomeruli and small arteries, or thrombi in the larger vessels <strong>must</strong> be treated to avoid life-threatening vascular damage. Patients with APS who have membranous nephropathy on kidney biopsy warrant consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation, even in the absence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, since such patients are at high risk for thrombotic events.

Summarized briefly, moderate-intensity <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (target International Normalized Ratio [INR] of 2 to 3) appears to be as effective as more intensive anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], while immunosuppressive therapy generally has little effect on aPL. There are insufficient data at present to recommend use of the newer oral anticoagulants in patients with aPL syndrome and renal disease. Patients with catastrophic APS are often treated with plasma exchange.

APS may occur alone (primary APS) or in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), other rheumatic diseases, and certain infections and drugs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary APS causes noninflammatory occlusion of renal blood vessels that, depending on the type of the involved blood vessels, results in renal infarction, ischemic changes, or in thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) involving the glomeruli. Patients who have large vessel involvement present with unilateral or bilateral flank pain, hematuria, and decreased renal function. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease in primary antiphospholipid syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with glomerular involvement, histology often resembles the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Other glomerular lesions that may be observed include membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H19782557\" class=\"local\">'Other glomerular lesions associated with primary antiphospholipid syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with APS associated with SLE present with systemic thromboses, fetal loss, neurologic disorders, thrombocytopenia, a false-positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test for syphilis, and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Among such patients, renal disease may result from microthrombi <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deposits of immune complexes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease in antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients on maintenance hemodialysis have a high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that are associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events, often involving the vascular access. The incidence of such antibodies appears to correlate with the use of dialysis and with the type of dialysis but not with age, gender, or dialysis duration. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A substantial number of renal transplant recipients have circulating aPL, which can damage the allograft. A renal TMA has also been observed in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected renal transplant recipients with aPL. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Renal transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of the patient with APS is the same whether or not renal disease is present. Patients with TMA in the glomeruli and small arteries or thrombi in the larger vessels <strong>must</strong> be treated with anticoagulation to avoid life-threatening vascular damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmapheresis and corticosteroids are of unproven value in the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) related to APS. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiphospholipid-syndrome-and-the-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Escalante A, Brey RL, Mitchell BD Jr, Dreiner U.
