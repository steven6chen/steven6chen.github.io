They are also referred to as AV septal defects, endocardial cushion defects, or persistent AV ostium.</p><p>The management and outcome of patients with AV canal defects will be reviewed here. The anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of AV canal defects are discussed separately.

It is characterized by a primum atrial septal defect (ASD) that is contiguous with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and a common AV valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial AV canal defect is due to incomplete fusion of the endocardial cushions and consists of a primum ASD and a common valvular annulus with two separate valve orifices. Due to abnormal fusion of the left tubercle of the superior and inferior cushions, the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is cleft, which is often associated with mitral valve regurgitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transitional AV canal defect is anatomically a subtype of complete AV canal defect, as it consists of a large primum defect, cleft mitral valve, and inlet VSD. However, dense chordal attachments to the ventricular septum result in small shunting at the ventricular level and delineate distinct left and right AV valve orifices, resulting in a defect that is similar to the physiology of a partial AV canal defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate AV canal defect is a rare subtype of complete AV canal defect, in which a bridging tongue of tissue divides a common AV valve into two distinct orifices. This defect is physiologically similar to a complete AV canal defect and usually has both a large primum atrial and large inlet ventricular septal defects. Due to natural division of the common AV valve into left and right AV valve components by the tongue of tissue, surgical division is not required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173193611\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management approach for atrioventricular (AV) canal defects is based on the type of defect, determining whether there are other associated anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities (eg, relative ventricular size, AV valve regurgitation, and right or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction), and whether or not other cardiac conditions are present (eg, patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]).</p><p>In general, surgical correction is recommended because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the uncorrected defect.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete AV canal defect &ndash; Patients with complete AV canal defects, including those with the intermediate type, generally develop heart failure by one year of age. In addition, uncorrected patients will develop elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to unrestricted pulmonary blood flow, and subsequent pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) resulting in systemic cyanosis due to right-to-left intracardiac shunting (ie, Eisenmenger's syndrome). As a result, in these patients, surgical intervention is recommended by six months of age.

Patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR) are more likely to present earlier with signs of MR, features of atrial fibrillation, or symptoms of heart failure.

The goal of medical management is to improve cardiac function, thereby optimizing the patient's condition before surgery.</p><p>Medical management includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic therapy reduces preload by promoting natriuresis, thereby relieving volume overload and pulmonary congestion. Diuretic agents include loop (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>) and thiazide diuretics.

In children, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the preferred agents, as there is a paucity of data on the use of angiotensin receptor blockers in pediatric heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management#H10100885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;, section on 'ACE inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promoting adequate nutrition, especially in patients with poor feeding and failure to thrive. In these patients, caloric supplementation is often needed and may require the use of nasogastric tube feeding or, rarely, gastric tube insertion before surgical repair.

However, in some cases with unbalanced lesions (ie, one of the ventricles is hypoplastic), a two-ventricle repair is not feasible. In those individuals, surgical palliation is performed using interventions developed for other single ventricular cardiac conditions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H1069697698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Surgical management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8314462\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary complete repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary repair in infancy has an operative mortality of less than 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The objectives of surgical repair are to close atrial and ventricular defects, and to form two separate and competent AV valves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173193872\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgical timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elective surgical repair is recommended prior to six months of age in order to avoid the development of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). Earlier repair should be considered in infants with heart failure who are unresponsive to medical management, symptomatic infants with significant AV valve regurgitation, or those with aortic coarctation. However, surgeons generally consider that optimal valve construction is more easily performed in patients who are older than six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In patients with Down syndrome, heart failure symptoms may not develop, probably due to persistent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from birth. Nevertheless, elective repair is recommended prior to six months of age regardless of whether symptoms are present or not because of concerns of developing PVD. Long-term outcome is similar in patients with Down syndrome repaired during infancy compared with patients without Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Adults with unrepaired complete AV canal defects are rarely encountered and generally have irreversible PVD with associated right-to-left shunting. Patients are not candidates for reparative surgery once PVD is severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173193932\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgical procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the first described successful surgical repair of AV canal defect in 1955 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the surgical correction of complete AV canal defects has undergone a number of modifications. Repair of complete AV canal defect is performed by one of the following approaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single-patch repair</strong> &ndash; In the single-patch technique, prosthetic patch material is placed to close the ventricular and atrial communications. The common AV valve is divided and re-attached to the patch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Two-patch repair</strong> &ndash; In the two-patch technique, prosthetic patch material is used to close the ventricular septal defect (VSD), and the common AV valve is sutured to the top of the patch. The atrial component is closed with a pericardial patch that is sutured to the common AV valve and ventricular patch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Modified (simplified) single-patch repair</strong> &ndash; In the modified single-patch technique, the common AV valve is directly sutured to the crest of the ventricular septum. Pericardium is used to close the atrial component and is sutured to the crest of the ventricular septum, separating the common AV valve into right and left components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This newer technique simplified the one-patch repair and resulted in significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-11</a>].</p><p/><p>There are limited observational data comparing these three techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. The optimal approach for primary complete repair remains uncertain. Most experts in the field suggest the major determinants of a successful outcome are surgeon preference and familiarity with a specific technique and institutional experience, rather than the technique itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a 2017 meta-analysis of 15 observational studies, including 1034 patients who underwent modified single-patch repair or two-patch repair, there were no significant differences between the two groups in early mortality (4.4 versus 5.2 percent, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.52-1.79), overall mortality (5.8 versus 5.5 percent; OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.64-2.19), complete heart block (1.6 versus 2.0 percent; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21-1.87), residual septal defects (3.3 versus 2.3 percent; OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.67-4.06), degree of AV valve regurgitation (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.10, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.06], or reoperation rate (6.3 versus 7.5 percent; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48-1.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Left ventricular outflow obstruction was less common in the modified single-patch repair group, but the difference was not statistically significant (0.6 versus 3.6 percent; OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.02-2.82). Compared with patients who underwent two-patch repair, those who underwent modified single-patch had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time, shorter aortic cross clamp time, and shorter length of hospital stay. Of note, patients in the modified single-patch group had smaller VSD size compared with the two-patch repair group. The modified single-patch has been used preferentially in patients with a comparatively smaller VSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Thus, the utility of this technique remains unclear in patients with a large VSD, and in these patients, it is unclear whether the outcome of this procedure is comparable or better than the other two procedures.</p><p>In a multicenter observational study of 120 children who underwent repair of complete AV canal from June 2004 and 2006, two-patch, one-patch, and the modified single-patch repair were used in 72, 18, and 10 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients who underwent the modified single-patch repair were younger on average compared with those corrected by either the single- or double-patch repair (mean age 2.6 versus 4.4 and 3.8 months, respectively). The overall in-hospital mortality was 2.5 percent, and six-month mortality was 4 percent. The incidence of residual VSD or left AV valve regurgitation was not affected by the age at operation, presence of Down syndrome, or type of repair. There was a lower rate of additional annuloplasty modifications in patients who underwent the modified single-patch repair compared with either the single- or double-patch repairs (0 versus 14 and 30 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266402567\"><span class=\"h4\">Cleft AV valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With any of the three techniques, closure of the cleft in the mitral component of the valve is controversial. Some investigators believe that the cleft in the left AV valve is a true commissure and should be left open so that the repaired valve functions as a three-leaflet valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other investigators state that the cleft should be closed because significant residual left AV valve regurgitation through the cleft is a frequent reason for reoperation.</p><p>Support for this latter view was based on results from a retrospective single-center study of all patients who underwent repair of complete AV canal defects from 1984 to 1997, which showed overall outcomes including that freedom from reoperation for left AV regurgitation was more favorable in patients who underwent left AV valve cleft repair (n = 96) compared with patients in whom the cleft was left open (n = 63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The authors concluded, and we agree, that the AV valve cleft should be surgically addressed whenever the morphology of the left AV valve allows for closure without producing stenosis.</p><p>This approach also appears to be beneficial even in the setting of a parachute left AV valve where there would be a concern for producing left AV valve stenosis with closure of the cleft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8314469\"><span class=\"h3\">Single ventricle palliation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;unbalanced AV canal defect&quot; has been used when there is significant right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) hypoplasia associated with an unequally positioned common AV valve either over the right or over the left ventricle. The management of unbalanced AV canal defect remains difficult. In general, two-ventricle repair is better tolerated in patients with RV hypoplasia than in patients with LV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects#H450999452\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects&quot;, section on 'Balanced/unbalanced classification'</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography is used to measure the relative sizes of the ventricles in patients with an unbalanced AV canal defect and to determine whether or not a complete primary repair is feasible. Echocardiographic features put forth as measures to determine suitability for complete repair include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV valve index &ndash; Derived by the ratio of the area of the AV valve apportioned to the LV over the combined area of the AV valve measured in the subcostal left anterior oblique view. Two-ventricle repair is typically successful when the AV valve index is between 0.4 and 0.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV inflow index &ndash; Secondary inflow diameter into the LV indexed to the left AV valve annulus diameter. LV inflow index less than 0.5 was associated with no survival after two-ventricle repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RV-LV inflow angle &ndash; The angle between the base of the RV and LV free wall and the crest of the ventricular septum. Increasing inflow angle was associated with successful two-ventricle repair. The morphological significance of this angle has not been elucidated, but the smaller angle may relate to a larger VSD and a narrower angle of inflow into the LV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>However, additional echocardiographic descriptors are needed to better discriminate balanced from unbalanced defects. An ongoing multicenter prospective study of AV canal defects is trying to better define the echocardiographic characteristics of balanced versus unbalanced defects and deciding on the surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>When a two-ventricle repair is not possible, palliative intervention (modified Fontan approach) is performed based on techniques developed in patients with single ventricular cardiac defects. The success of this approach is dependent on the competency of the AV valve and the protection of the pulmonary vascular bed.</p><p>Surgical repair typically consists of three staged palliative procedures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H1069697698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Surgical management'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 establishes a controlled source of pulmonary blood flow and provides blood flow from the &quot;single ventricle,&quot; which can either be a dominant right or left ventricle, to the systemic circulation. In some cases, pulmonary artery banding is sufficient, but in others, banding of the pulmonary artery to lower pulmonary artery pressure may lead to worsening of AV valve regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subsequent distortion of the central pulmonary arteries. In these patients, an alternative approach directly shunts pulmonary blood flow from a systemic artery to pulmonary artery through a component of a divided main pulmonary artery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 is performed when the patients begin to outgrow their original shunt. In general, a bidirectional Glenn shunt or a hemi-Fontan procedure is performed that results in direct drainage of blood from the superior vena cava into the pulmonary artery. This leads to improved systemic oxygenation and a decreased volume load on the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 is performed after further growth. This stage entails a modified Fontan procedure that separates the venous and arterial circulations. This separation is obtained by baffling the blood return from the inferior vena cava directly to the pulmonary artery, usually with an extracardiac conduit.</p><p/><p>Similar to HLHS, mortality is high in patients with unbalanced lesions who are not amenable to two-ventricular repair. The three-stage palliative approach reduces early mortality, but the long-term outcome remains uncertain.

However, these defects are associated with a moderate to large left-to-right shunt that is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Thus, with increasing age, patients are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of right heart failure, especially with exertion. Patients with left AV valve regurgitation are more likely to develop symptoms of left ventricular (LV) volume overload and heart failure (eg, growth failure and dyspnea) at an earlier age.</p><p>Elective surgical repair is recommended to lessen the incidence of morbidity later in life including heart failure and atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The goal of surgical repair is to close the interatrial communication, and restore and preserve left AV valve competence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects#H8312866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects&quot;, section on 'Partial and transitional AV canal defect presentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H173193611\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p>Because of low morbidity and nearly absent mortality, surgical repair for partial and transitional AV canal defect is usually performed when the patient is 18 to 24 months of age or, in older patients, whenever the diagnosis is made. This was illustrated in a retrospective multicenter study of 87 patients who underwent repair of a partial or transitional defect in seven centers in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The median age at surgery was 1.8 years; 20 percent of patients had growth failure and one-third of patients had moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation. These last two findings are indicative of a more symptomatic and severely affected cohort. At mean follow-up, there was one death (perioperative fatality of a four-day-old infant who also underwent arch reconstruction), three patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction, and one with a residual atrial septal defect (ASD). Improved weight gain was observed with an increase in the median Z-score of 0.4 units. Left AV valve regurgitation was the most common residual defect, occurring more frequently in children repaired after four years of age. These results suggest that surgical repair before preschool age may be advantageous in preventing left AV valve regurgitation.</p><p>Surgical repair of partial and transitional AV canal defects involves patch closure of the ostium primum defect and mitral valvuloplasty to eliminate or to minimize mitral regurgitation (MR). For moderate or severe MR, surgeons suture the mitral valve cleft closed and perform a mitral annuloplasty when associated annular dilatation is present. Surgical closure of the cleft in the presence of mild or no MR is controversial. For transitional AV canal defects, the ventricular septal defect (VSD) may be closed primarily or with a patch depending on its size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8314483\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H901308524\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative complications include pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, and residual left AV valve regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8314490\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major risk factors for development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with AV canal defects include the presence of Down syndrome and age at operation (the risk increases with age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Failure of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions to fuse correctly during cardiac embryology results in complete (both atrial and ventricular septal defects <span class=\"nowrap\">[ASD/VSD])</span> and partial (only ASD) anatomic forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86346 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H173193592\" class=\"local\">'Various forms of AV canal defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV canal defects require surgical repair because there is considerable morbidity and mortality associated with uncorrected defects. The management approach is based on the type of AV canal defect, determining whether there are other associated anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities (eg, relative ventricular size, AV valve regurgitation, and right or left ventricular outflow obstruction), and whether or not other cardiac conditions (eg, patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]) are present. Our approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H173193611\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete AV canal defects &ndash; Management of complete AV canal defects encompasses initial medical management for heart failure, and either primary complete repair or palliative intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The goal of medical management is to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure, thereby optimizing the patient's condition before surgery. Therapeutic interventions include diuretic therapy, inotropic support, angiotensin blockade, and the provision of adequate nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H8314448\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with a balanced complete AV canal defect (two ventricles are similar in size), we recommend primary surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Repair of complete AV canal defect is performed using single-patch, two-patch, or modified single-patch approaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86337\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86337 \">figure 3</a>). The choice of approach is based largely on surgeon preference and institutional experience. We recommend that repair occur before six months of age rather than deferring repair until later in childhood (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Surgical intervention during early infancy is associated with a low mortality rate and avoids the development of pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H8314462\" class=\"local\">'Primary complete repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8314490\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients in whom a two-ventricle repair is not feasible (ie, patients with unbalanced lesions wherein one of the ventricles is hypoplastic), we suggest surgical palliation be performed using interventions developed for single ventricular cardiac conditions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or tricuspid atresia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8314469\" class=\"local\">'Single ventricle palliation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial and transitional AV valve defects &ndash; For patients with partial and transitional AV canal defects, we recommend surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The rationale for surgical repair in these patients is to reduce morbidity later in life, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Elective surgical repair in early childhood is associated with low morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H8314476\" class=\"local\">'Partial and transitional AV canal defect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall mortality rate for surgical repair of AV canal defects is approximately 3 percent, and the 10-year survival rate exceeds 90 percent.
