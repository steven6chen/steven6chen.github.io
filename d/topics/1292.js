The individual is concerned that embarrassment or humiliation will result, and so he or she avoids such situations, or endures them with intense anxiety.</p><p>SAD is a prevalent condition, estimated to affect between 4 and 10 percent of the adult United States population over a 12-month period. SAD typically begins in childhood or adolescence and, untreated, can be associated with the subsequent development of major depression, substance abuse, and other mental health problems. The disorder can be associated with extensive functional impairment and reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic describes our approach to selecting treatments for SAD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F110492\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110492 \">algorithm 1</a>) and performance-only SAD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F110968\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110968 \">algorithm 2</a>). The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis of SAD are discussed separately, as are the efficacy, side effects, and administration of individual psychotherapies and medications for SAD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Social anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3773408540\"><span class=\"h1\">NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3717761578\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) require immediate treatment. Young adults, in particular, may benefit from education about their disorder and may need time to reflect on the extent to which social anxiety and avoidance have negatively impacted their lives. It is not unusual for a newly diagnosed patient with SAD to be surprised that these symptoms can diminish or resolve with treatment as opposed to being an inalterable aspect of their self. The need for treatment of SAD is rarely an emergency. Most patients have had SAD for many years, and the decision to seek a diagnosis may have taken a long time.</p><p>After the diagnosis of SAD is established, if the patient prefers to meet further before deciding about treatment, the clinician and patient can further discuss the need for treatment in the context of a longitudinal evaluation of the extent to which social anxiety has impacted the individual&rsquo;s quality of life, as well as consideration of future life goals and how those may be affected by social anxiety and avoidance. Once a mutual decision is reached that treatment is indicated, the next step involves discussion of treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3528272813\"><span class=\"h2\">SAD versus SAD, performance only</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5, the subtypes of generalized and nongeneralized social anxiety disorder (SAD) were replaced by SAD and SAD, performance only, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We take the same approach for the two SAD types for psychotherapy, but different approaches to medication treatment. Clinical trials of treatments for SAD studied samples primarily composed of patients with the generalized form of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1299638998\" class=\"local\">'SAD, performance only'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H147157737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Social anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2717449601\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing between psychotherapy and medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both types of SAD, we suggest first-line treatment of SAD with either pharmacotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Both treatments reduce social anxiety compared with placebo, but clinical trials (described below) have not found one modality to be superior to the other. The selection between pharmacotherapy and CBT should be made on the basis of informed patient preference and treatment availability. </p><p>Onset of symptom response may be faster with pharmacotherapy, although CBT appears to result in a more durable response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Speed of onset is rarely an important attribute in the treatment of SAD, as most patients have had the disorder for many years and a difference of a few weeks in response time is largely irrelevant.</p><p>Randomized trials comparing CBT with pharmacotherapy for SAD have not demonstrated clear superiority of one treatment modality over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. As an example, a randomized clinical trial of 128 patients with SAD compared the monoamine oxidase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a> with drug placebo, group CBT tailored for SAD, and the combination of phenelzine and group CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After 12 weeks, there was not a statistically significant difference in response rates (as measured by the Clinical Global Improvement scale) between the CBT group and the phenelzine group; both groups had higher response rates compared with the placebo group (47.1 versus 54.3 versus 33.3 percent). </p><p>Clinical trials have not reliably shown the combination of CBT and medication to be superior to either modality individually. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT and antidepressants &ndash; Clinical trials have found mixed results for the combination of CBT and antidepressant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A trial randomly assigned 295 patients with DSM-IV generalized SAD to one of five groups: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, group CBT, combined group CBT and placebo, combined group CBT and fluoxetine, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A higher proportion of patients responded to fluoxetine (51 percent), group CBT (52 percent), combined group CBT and placebo (51 percent) and combined group CBT and fluoxetine (54 percent) than to placebo (32 percent). However, the group receiving combined medication and CBT did not differ significantly in response compared with groups receiving either monotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the randomized trial of 128 patients with SAD described above, combined group CBT-phenelzine resulted in higher response rates compared with either modality as monotherapy (71.9 versus 47.1 and 54.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT and d-cycloserine &ndash; A large clinical trial examining augmentation of CBT with d-cycloserine, a partial N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, showed no benefit over placebo augmentation at post-test or follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This finding was in contrast to two earlier, smaller trials that suggested that d-cycloserine may accelerate clinical response to exposure for SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p>There is some evidence that the patient&rsquo;s beliefs about the etiology of SAD should be factor in selecting between psychotherapy and medication for the disorder. Among patients receiving the SSRI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> for SAD, those who attributed the onset of their SAD to genetic, biological, and early life experiences had the most rapid response to paroxetine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3809804366\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient preference for psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with either SAD or SAD, performance-only who prefer psychotherapy rather than medication, we suggest first-line treatment with either individual or group CBT customized for SAD rather than other psychotherapies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4212209934\"><span class=\"h4\">Comparative efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a small number of head-to-head clinical trials comparing CBT with other psychotherapies for SAD, providing some evidence favoring CBT. Individual trials found CBT to be superior to interpersonal psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and applied relaxation plus exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Direct comparisons of CBT with psychodynamic psychotherapy did not convincingly favor either treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, a 2013 clinical trial compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy customized to treatment of SAD against waitlist in 495 patients with SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients in both CBT and psychodynamic psychotherapy groups experienced reduced SAD symptoms compared with baseline, and compared with waitlist at post-assessment. CBT demonstrated superior response compared with psychodynamic psychotherapy on some social anxiety measures at post-assessment; however, differences were small in magnitude and not found during the follow-up assessments conducted up to 24 months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A network meta-analysis including 101 clinical trials found CBT to be superior to no treatment, pill placebo, psychological control conditions, and several psychotherapies including psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Network meta-analyses utilize all available data from randomized clinical trials to estimate the effect of each intervention relative to other interventions (even those that have never been compared directly).</p><p>Comparison of placebo controlled trials of psychotherapies for social anxiety disorder suggests that CBT is the best studied and most efficacious of the psychotherapies for SAD. </p><p>A meta-analysis of five randomized trials totaling 318 patients found traditional CBT to be efficacious for SAD compared with placebo control (odds ratio = 4.21; 95% CI 2.07-8.98). Medium to large positive effects (Hedges g = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72; 0.97) on social anxiety symptoms have been seen for group CBT tailored for SAD compared with waitlist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

More recent, tailored CBT protocols, which target specific maintenance factors, have been shown to be more efficacious for SAD, compared with standard CBT approaches to the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23</a>].</p><p>CBT has traditionally been provided to groups of four to six patients with SAD by two therapists in 12 weekly two and a half hour sessions. More recent modifications of this format include individual treatment sessions lasting 60 minutes scheduled weekly for up to 15 weeks.
