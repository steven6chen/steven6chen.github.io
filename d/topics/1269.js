Proliferation of neutrophil precursors, the process of myeloid differentiation, and entry of these cells into the circulation are tightly regulated by cytokines and are dependent on orderly control of gene expression by transcription factors. Neutrophils persist in the peripheral blood for only about 10 hours before they enter peripheral tissues in response to <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/inflammation,</span> or undergo apoptosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-myelopoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of myelopoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increased production of neutrophils may be autonomous (ie, due to malignant disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms) or reactive (ie, in response to infectious or inflammatory processes).</p><p>Approximately half of circulating neutrophils are reversibly adherent to the endothelium (&quot;marginated&quot;), so processes that increase neutrophil demargination can rapidly elevate the WBC count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183554308\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF NEUTROPHILIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of neutrophilia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80503\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80503 \">table 2</a>) vary according to the patient population and clinical setting. As examples, the causes of neutrophilia in hospitalized patients differ from those of asymptomatic ambulatory patients, and children are more likely than adults to have inherited disorders.</p><p>The urgency and nature of the clinical evaluation of neutrophilia are described below. (See <a href=\"#H732441397\" class=\"local\">'Urgency of evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3160636894\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3272424300\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is considerable variability in neutrophil counts in asymptomatic normal populations. Because neutrophilia is defined as at least two standard deviations above the mean, by definition, 2.5 percent of the normal population will be classified as having neutrophilia.</p><p>Normal variation is particularly relevant in the asymptomatic patient with persistent mild neutrophilia. Serial evaluation may be required to establish the absence of underlying pathology. Examination of the parents' or siblings' blood counts may be of help in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>As an example, one report described 34 otherwise healthy subjects with total leukocyte counts of 11,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">40,000/microL;</span> other components of the complete blood count were normal other than occasional thrombocytosis, and bone marrow examination was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No medical problems became apparent after more than 20 years of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4074435695\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections are a common cause of neutrophilia in adults and children, in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Acute infection should be particularly suspected in patients with a total white blood cell (WBC) count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;25,000/microL</span>.</p><p>Based on personal experience, the WBC count may rise as high as <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> in patients with infection or inflammation, but the leukocytosis usually decreases within days of starting treatment. As long as the WBC count is decreasing in response to therapy, the neutrophilia is likely to be reactive.</p><p>Neutrophilia with a left shift is commonly seen in association with acute bacterial infections. The blood smear may reveal toxic granulations, D&ouml;hle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70248 \">picture 1</a>). Support for the diagnosis may come from clinical evaluation, microbiologic studies, and associated clinical findings (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation); markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) are typically abnormal, but nonspecific. Neutrophilia in the setting of viral infections may be accompanied by &quot;atypical&quot; lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-lymphocytosis-or-lymphocytopenia#H6983587\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the child with lymphocytosis'</a>.)</p><p>Certain bacteria (eg, pneumococcus, staphylococcus, clostridial species) may cause particularly high leukocyte counts. Unexplained leukocytosis in hospitalized patients, even without diarrhea, may be a harbinger of <em>Clostridium difficile </em>infection, and usually occurs after 5 to 10 days of antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Neutrophilia in children may be associated with certain viral infections (eg, herpes simplex, varicella), various bacterial infections, leptospiral infections, advanced tuberculosis, and mononucleosis (particularly in the child younger than five years).</p><p>In one study performed in an emergency department, compared with age-matched controls with moderate leukocytosis (WBC 12,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">25,000/microL),</span> patients with WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;25,000/microL</span> were more likely to have an infectious disease (74 versus 48 percent) and had a higher mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2307589968\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both acute and chronic inflammatory processes can cause neutrophilia. Examples include juvenile onset rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease (in which a leukemoid reaction can occur), rheumatoid arthritis in adults, and adult Still's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, granulomatous infections, bronchiectasis, or chronic hepatitis may develop neutrophilia, especially during disease flares.</p><p>Sweet syndrome (also called acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis), is characterized by neutrophilia, fever, and the abrupt appearance of erythematous, painful, cutaneous plaques. Sweet syndrome is discussed in greater detail separately.

CRP and ESR are typically elevated, but they are nonspecific measures of inflammation; nevertheless, these tests are particularly helpful in detecting occult inflammation or infection. There are no diagnostic findings on the peripheral blood smear. Rather, microbiologic studies that exclude infections, or cytogenetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular tests that exclude malignancies (eg, chronic myeloid leukemia) may be required to indict inflammation as the cause of neutrophilia.</p><p>One study of 87 patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis showed that the neutrophil count was the best correlate for active inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

There are no diagnostic abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear, but allergic-type drug reactions are often accompanied by modest eosinophilia.</p><p>Neutrophilia may begin within hours of drug administration (eg, from demargination or accelerated bone marrow release) or days or weeks later (eg, allergic reactions, increased proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differentiation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1138924034\"><span class=\"h2\">Asplenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate neutrophilia is often associated with asplenia, whether it is related to surgical splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], autoinfarction in sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-neutrophilia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], or other causes.
