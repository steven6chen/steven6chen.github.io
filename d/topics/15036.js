Suspected cases of food allergies are often not confirmed when objective investigations, including food challenges, are undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-manifestations-of-food-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Two percent of children in a cohort of 1218 consecutive births followed until four years of age developed egg allergy. Increased risk of respiratory allergy (rhinitis or asthma) was associated with egg allergy (odds ratio [OR] 5.0, 95% CI 1.1-22.3), with a positive predictive value of 55 percent.

Food allergy status was determined based upon the type and timing of clinical symptoms after ingestion of a specific food and results of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to foods using skin prick testing and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptomatic food allergy was associated with asthma in both older (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.5-9.5) and younger children (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.7-16.2). The association was stronger among children with multiple or severe food allergies, especially in older children.

These exposures occur in both occupational and nonoccupational settings.

The most common example is baker's asthma triggered by occupational exposure to wheat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-manifestations-of-food-allergy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, blinded challenges often do not confirm these triggers. Several different food additives, including sulfites and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium benzoate</a>, have been implicated in adverse respiratory reactions.

Further workup for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy is not generally indicated if no specific foods are implicated in the history and if skin tests or in vitro measurements of specific IgE to foods are negative.</p><p>Food is unlikely to be the problem if respiratory symptoms persist after food elimination diets are implemented. Respiratory symptoms that recur after a regular diet has been resumed should be evaluated with a food challenge.

The association between food allergy and asthmatic symptoms is seen mainly in children, especially those with atopic dermatitis, and occurs primarily after ingestion of the food allergen. In adults, isolated asthma as a manifestation of food allergy is most commonly related to inhalation exposure and is seen primarily in food industry workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-manifestations-of-food-allergy/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Patients with both asthma and food allergies are at increased risk for morbidity and possibly mortality from these conditions. Thus, close follow-up of these patients is advised.

Seventeen percent of children developed wheezing during positive food challenges. Eighty-eight patients were monitored with pulmonary function testing during food challenges.
