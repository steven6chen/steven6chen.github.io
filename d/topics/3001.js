The following three cases illustrate some of the problems that can occur with intensive insulin therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 32-year-old man usually has well-controlled diabetes. He takes 4 units of lispro and 18 units of detemir before breakfast (9 AM), 2 to 4 units of lispro at lunch (1 PM), and 4 to 8 units of lispro with his evening meal (5 PM). Despite a severe upper respiratory infection, he is determined to follow his usual exercise program. He awakens at 8 AM and has a blood glucose of 298 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (16.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. He decides to go for a five-mile run before breakfast; he plans to take his morning insulin dose after the run. At that time, he is surprised to find that his blood glucose has risen to 344 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (19.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who take detemir insulin once a day in the morning, the insulin effect may wear off by 8 or 9 AM the next morning. Such a patient has little insulin available before exercise; furthermore, the stress of the intercurrent infection in this case will promote the release of counterregulatory hormones (epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone) that induce relative insulin resistance. The lack of sufficient insulin effect results in glucose being released from the liver but not being taken up by skeletal muscle. Thus, his blood glucose will rise and he may fatigue easily during the run due to the fall in muscle glucose utilization.</p><p>It would have been wiser not to run that day. If this were unacceptable, he should have taken some extra lispro insulin before the run (perhaps 6 units, depending upon his usual algorithm). After the run, his blood glucose would probably have been somewhat lower. If it were still above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> he should have taken another 6 units of lispro before breakfast.</p><p>He should also consider whether he could improve his glycemic control by taking his detemir insulin twice a day or switching to a longer-acting insulin like glargine. However, this change in regimen should not be attempted until he has recovered from the respiratory infection and until he discusses it with his doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 45-year-old woman who has had type 1 diabetes for 24 years has noticed frequent hypoglycemic reactions associated with exercise, such as playing golf, aerobics, or cycling. She takes 6 units of regular and 16 units of NPH before breakfast, 6 units of regular before her evening meal, and 10 units of NPH before bedtime. She has tried to prevent hypoglycemia by eating more food. This has led to weight gain but has not prevented symptomatic hypoglycemia during exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of this patient requires answers to the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What time does she exercise and is it approximately the same time each day?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effect of exercise on blood glucose varies with the prevailing plasma insulin level. When the person is hypoinsulinemic (as often happens after awakening in the morning, before the morning injection), exercise can cause an increase in blood glucose since the glucose released from the liver cannot be taken up by the muscles. On the other hand, exercising shortly after taking an insulin injection may result in faster absorption of the insulin and a rapid decrease in blood glucose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-exercise-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of exercise in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At what site is the insulin injected?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insulin is absorbed most quickly from the abdomen, more slowly from the arm, and slowest from the leg and buttock (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). The best way to rotate injection sites is to give the morning shot in the abdomen (or arm) and the evening shot in the buttock, but to switch sides and exact locations within these areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It might also be appropriate to consider an overall reduction in her insulin dose or to reduce the dose in a specific injection in anticipation of upcoming exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How vigorously is she treating the hypoglycemic reactions?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Low blood glucose levels often lead to a feeling of panic and the intake of excessive amounts of carbohydrate to reverse the reaction. This can have two deleterious effects. First, hyperglycemia may occur for several hours due to the combination of glucose ingestion and glucose released from the liver in response to hypoglycemia. Second, repeated ingestion of extra calories can lead to weight gain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 44-year-old woman is interested in beginning a vigorous exercise program consisting of one hour of racquetball, three times per week, between 9 and 10 PM. Her current insulin regimen consists of 6 units of regular before breakfast, 4 units of regular before lunch, 8 units of regular before dinner, and 10 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> before bedtime.</p><p>On the first day of her exercise program, her blood glucose before dinner (6 PM) is 124 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. She takes her usual dose of 8 units of regular. Her blood glucose is 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before racquetball and 138 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before bedtime. She awakens at 2 AM with a severe hypoglycemic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation and approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscles deplete their stores of glycogen during marked exercise. For several hours after exercise, the muscles then take up glucose to replenish the glycogen stores, thereby gradually lowering the blood glucose. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, she should reduce her dose of regular before her evening meal by perhaps 4 units and she should take a larger than usual bedtime snack. She can use the postexercise glucose levels to assess the changes induced by exercise and food, thereby allowing her to make appropriate adjustments before her next similar workout.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"topicVersionRevision\">Topic 1806 Version 7.0</div></div>","outline":"<div id=\"outlineSections\"><h2>Topic Outline</h2><ul id=\"innerOutline\"><li><a href=\"#H1\" id=\"outline-link-H1\">INTRODUCTION</a></li><li><a href=\"#H2\" id=\"outline-link-H2\">CASE 1</a><ul><li><a href=\"#H3\" id=\"outline-link-H3\">Interpretation and approach</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#H4\" id=\"outline-link-H4\">CASE 2</a><ul><li><a href=\"#H5\" id=\"outline-link-H5\">Interpretation and approach</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#H6\" id=\"outline-link-H6\">CASE 3</a><ul><li><a href=\"#H7\" id=\"outline-link-H7\">Interpretation and approach</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><div><h2>RELATED TOPICS</h2><div id=\"outlineTopics\"><ul><li class=\"plainItem\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-exercise-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Effects of exercise in adults with diabetes mellitus</a></li><li class=\"plainItem\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus</a></li></ul></div></div>","javascript":null}
