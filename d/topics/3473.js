When they are working normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In people with CKD, the kidneys slowly lose the ability to filter the blood. In time, the kidneys can stop working completely. That is why it is so important to keep CKD from getting worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818401\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CKD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, CKD causes no symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your feet, ankles, or legs swell (doctors call this &quot;edema&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you high blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make you very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage your bones</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818408\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep my kidneys from getting worse if I have CKD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you can protect your kidneys by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking blood pressure and other medicines every day, if your doctor or nurse prescribes them to you</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your blood sugar in a healthy range, if you have diabetes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing your diet, if your doctor or nurse says you should</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quitting smoking, if you smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding medicines known as &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,&quot; or NSAIDs. These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). Check with your doctor, nurse, or kidney specialist before starting any new medicines &ndash; even over-the-counter ones.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818415\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the treatments for CKD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People in the early stages of CKD can take medicines to keep the disease from getting worse. For example, many people with CKD should take medicines known as &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot; or &quot;angiotensin receptor blockers.&quot; If your doctor or nurse prescribes these medicines, it is very important that you take them every day as directed. If they cause side effects or cost too much, speak to your doctor or nurse about it. He or she might have solutions to offer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818422\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my kidneys stop working completely?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your kidneys stop working completely, you can choose between 3 different treatments to take over the job of your kidneys. Your choices are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can have kidney transplant surgery. That way, the new kidney can do the job of your own kidneys. If you have a kidney transplant, you will need to take medicines for the rest of your life to keep your body from reacting badly to the new kidney. (You only need one kidney to live.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can have your blood filtered by a machine. This treatment is called &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; but many people call it just &quot;dialysis.&quot; If you choose this approach, you will need to be hooked up to the machine at least 3 times a week for a few hours for the rest of your life. Before you start, you will also need to have surgery to prepare a blood vessel for attachment to the machine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can learn to use a special fluid that has to be piped in and out of your belly every day. This treatment is called &quot;peritoneal dialysis.&quot; If you choose this type of dialysis, you will need surgery to have a tube implanted in your belly. Then you will have to learn how to pipe the fluid in and out through that tube.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818429\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose between the different treatment options?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will need to work together to find a treatment that's right for you. Kidney transplant surgery is usually the best option for most people. But often there are no kidneys available for transplant.</p><p>Ask your doctor to explain all of your options and how they might work for you. Then talk openly with him or her about how you feel about all of the options. You might even decide that you do not want any treatment. That is your choice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34818436\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-between-dialysis-and-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing between dialysis and kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=planning-for-a-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Planning for a kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-problems-caused-by-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone problems caused by kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?
