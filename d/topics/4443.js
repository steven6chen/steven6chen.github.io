In studies of congenital CMV infection after the advent of universal newborn hearing screening, categorization of these infants as &quot;symptomatic&quot; or &quot;asymptomatic&quot; is inconsistent. Historically, they were often classified as &quot;asymptomatic&quot; because the hearing loss may not have been detected at birth. However, with universal newborn hearing screening, many such infants come to medical attention in the newborn period. We consider these infants to represent a distinct category because they are not truly asymptomatic, but their disease is generally milder than that of symptomatic infants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22557899\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526096465\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and management of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease may begin with the fetus in utero and fetal interventions may be indicated if severe, life-threatening symptoms are present in the fetus.

A subsequent randomized clinical trial evaluated six months versus six weeks of valganciclovir therapy in 96 infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection with and without CNS involvement.

Children identified with hearing deficits may benefit from referral to early intervention programs and educational accommodations such as preferential classroom seating.

Infants congenitally infected with CMV may benefit from antiviral therapy, especially if treatment is initiated within the first month of life. (See <a href=\"#H22557885\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with congenital CMV infection are classified according to the presence or absence of apparent symptoms at birth:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Symptomatic&quot; refers to infants with one or more symptoms at birth.

In infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ganciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valganciclovir</a> has been shown to improve long-term audiologic and neurodevelopmental outcomes. At the author&rsquo;s institution, we also treat infants with isolated hearing loss (ie, asymptomatic infants with failed hearing screen), although evidence is lacking and expert opinion varies as to whether the benefits of antiviral therapy outweigh the risks in this group. We suggest not treating asymptomatic infants who pass their hearing screen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

We monitor CMV DNAemia levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) throughout antiviral therapy. DNAemia levels usually decline by the second to fourth week of antiviral therapy.
