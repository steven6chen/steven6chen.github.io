An abnormal level of each of these is the result of one or more genetic abnormalities or secondary to some underlying disease or environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>One definition of dyslipidemia is total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglyceride, or lipoprotein(a) levels above the 90th percentile or high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apoA-1 levels below the 10th percentile for the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71803 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Elevation of LDL-C is common in the general population. Most of these individuals have one or more genetic abnormalities rather than a secondary cause (such as liver or kidney disease) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-causes-of-dyslipidemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary causes of dyslipidemia&quot;</a>). For individuals with LDL-C above 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the genetic defects that lead to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are the most common underlying cause (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview&quot;</a>). This topic will discuss non-FH causes of elevated LDL-C.</p><p>General treatment guidelines for elevated LDL-C and possible indications for the therapy of other dyslipidemias, such as low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated serum lipoprotein(a), are discussed in other topic reviews.

It is highest in populations of patients with premature coronary heart disease (CHD), which can be defined as occurring before 55 to 60 years of age in men and before 65 years in women. In this setting, the prevalence of dyslipidemia is as high as 75 to 85 percent compared with approximately 40 to 48 percent in age-matched controls without CHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59944 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The lipid abnormality is often familial. In one study, for example, 54 percent of all patients with premature CHD (and 70 percent of those with a lipid abnormality) had a familial disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the great majority of patients, inheritance is polygenic and the expression of dyslipidemia is strongly influenced by factors such as obesity (particularly central obesity) and the saturated fat and cholesterol content of the diet. </p><p>In nations with low rates of obesity and where saturated fat intake is low, both the incidence of CHD and the prevalence of dyslipidemia are low compared with North America and Europe. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS OF ELEVATED LDL-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology surrounding the hereditary disorders of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism can be confusing. Individual patients may have one (monogenetic) or more (polygenetic) genetic defects that lead to a particular phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Polygenic hypercholesterolemia'</a> below.) </p><p>The clinical syndrome of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the leading clinical phenotype resulting from monogenic, usually dominantly inherited defects in LDL catabolism. As FH has been well studied and there is an extensive literature, it is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia are examples of syndromes with polygenic inheritance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a relatively common lipid disorder. It occurs in 1 to 2 percent of the general population and accounts for one-third to one-half of familial causes of coronary heart disease (CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and 10 percent of cases of premature CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In affected families, some individuals will have hypertriglyceridemia, some hypercholesterolemia, some both, and some neither. </p><p>The clinical manifestations include premature CHD (particularly in patients with concurrent hypertriglyceridemia), xanthelasma (in 10 percent of cases), and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Coexisting diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance is more common in patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>One study of 63 families with FCHL found that, after adjustment for baseline covariates, 20-year cardiovascular disease mortality was increased among siblings and offspring in FCHL compared with spouse control subjects (relative risk 1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Baseline triglyceride concentrations were not independently associated with an increased risk.</p><p>FCHL is thought to be a genetically complex disease and the phenotype is usually determined by interaction of multiple susceptibility genes and the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Co-inheritance of two or more gene variants potentially affecting lipoprotein metabolism are generally required for the expression of FCHL.</p><p>In many cases, FCHL is caused by overproduction of hepatically-derived apoB-100 associated with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these cases, there is an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. ApoB levels are strongly correlated with LDL phenotype B in FCHL families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]; LDL phenotype B levels are inherited as a Mendelian trait that is distinct from the apoB genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LDL phenotype B is associated with increased serum concentrations of apoB and triglycerides, reduced serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63857 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and a threefold increase in risk of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. LDL phenotype A is associated with large buoyant LDL particles; in comparison, phenotype B is characterized by small, dense LDL particles. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Small dense LDL (LDL phenotype B)'</a> below.)</p><p>A study of 31 extended Finnish FCHL families suggested a novel locus on chromosome 1q21-q23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A follow-up study that included an additional 29 families found that FCHL was linked and associated with the gene encoding upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1); USF1 encodes a transcription factor known to regulate several genes involved in glucose and lipoprotein metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The phenotypic heterogeneity derives from variations in LDL subclass pattern and an associated impairment in lipoprotein lipase (mass and activity) in one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Those patients with abnormal lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function have higher levels of triglycerides (due to decreased clearance) and lower levels of HDL-C (due to reduced production from triglyceride-depleted VLDL remnants) than those with normal LPL activity. In at least some patients, a mutation in the LPL gene is responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because FCHL is phenotypically heterogeneous, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels may vary within an affected individual over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], diagnosis of this disorder or the possible variant hyperapobetalipoproteinemia requires family data. The presence of one of these two conditions is suggested by an LDL-to-apoB ratio of less than 1.2 (normal value &gt;1.4).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first-line treatment of FCHL is a statin, irrespective of whether or not triglyceride levels are elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which is effective therapy for lowering apoB levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The potency and dose of statin should be chosen with the aim of achieving LDL-C &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in primary prevention and &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in secondary prevention. High intensity statins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 80 mg daily and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> 40 mg daily) lower triglycerides by 43 percent in patients with triglycerides as high as 800 to 850 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The main reason for introducing statins before fibrates in hypertriglyceridemic dyslipidemias is not that they are better at lowering triglycerides, but because of the randomized clinical trial evidence that they are safe and that they decrease cardiovascular disease risk and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Similar evidence does not exist for fibrates. </p><p>It should be kept in mind that when triglyceride concentrations are high (&ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> the laboratory may be unable to provide accurate LDL-C measurements; non-HDL cholesterol targets should be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins#H24362266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of blood lipids and lipoproteins&quot;, section on 'Non-HDL cholesterol'</a>.)</p><p>If the LDL-C or non-HDL-C therapeutic goals are not reached, addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> can be considered. Generally, bile acid sequestrants are avoided in hypertriglyceridemia, which they may exacerbate. The exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colesevelam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colesevelam</a>, which, if administered to achieve greater lowering of LDL or non-HDL-C, has a lesser adverse effect on triglycerides in studies that included an upper triglyceride limit of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> while reducing the total atherogenic burden of apoB-containing lipoproteins, and it improves glucose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Often, triglycerides will remain elevated after statin treatment (with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>). The decision to add a drug to lower triglycerides is a difficult one. For many years, fibrate drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">niacin</a> were employed for this purpose, but randomized clinical trial evidence does not support any effect of these drugs in reducing cardiovascular disease events or improving overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Subgroup analysis does suggest that fibrate monotherapy can decrease the likelihood of CHD events in hypertriglyceridemia. However, it is uncertain that this is the case in patients also receiving statin treatment. As the benefit is uncertain, we suggest referring statin-treated patients with significant residual hypertriglyceridemia to a lipid specialist for consideration of additional therapy. An alternative is to consider adding a highly purified omega-3 fatty acid preparation to the statin treatment to decrease triglycerides further. Evidence, although conflicted, does suggest improved survival from taking highly purified omega-3's in people with CHD. Furthermore, the risk of myopathy is not increased in combination with statin treatment as it is with fibrates and niacin.</p><p>Glucose intolerance is common in hypertriglyceridemia and when type 2 diabetes is discovered in hypertriglyceridemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> should be considered as initial treatment, because of its action in mitigating weight gain and improving lipid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYGENIC HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Without genetic testing, it can be difficult to differentiate polygenic hypercholesterolemia from familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Studies have identified minor low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-elevating alleles that contribute to the familial basis for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar to patients with monogenic FH, these patients have familial aggregation of moderate hypercholesterolemia and the premature onset of coronary heart disease (CHD). The lipid profile shows an elevated LDL-C level, and (usually) a normal triglyceride level; tendon xanthoma are not seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66747 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-overview#H384771452\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview&quot;, section on 'Genetic considerations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetics of polygenic hypercholesterolemia are poorly understood but multiple abnormalities in LDL metabolism are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>These abnormalities in LDL metabolism include mild defects in the LDL receptor, defective apoB-100, increased synthesis of apoB, and the presence of the apoE4 phenotype. ApoE is required for receptor-mediated clearance of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein remnants from the circulation. ApoE4 has a higher affinity for the LDL receptor than the other apoE isoforms. The enhanced lipid binding leads, via negative feedback, to downregulation of LDL receptor synthesis and consequently a secondary rise in LDL-C levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Apolipoproteins'</a>.)</p><p>A genetic study of over 600 patients with clinical FH and 3020 controls attempted to distinguish patients with polygenic and monogenic FH by genotyping for the three known genetic causes of FH (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genetics of elevated LDL-C'</a> above) and 12 common LDL-C raising single-nucleotide polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this study, only about 50 percent of patients with clinical FH had monogenic FH; of these, many had multiple minor cholesterol-elevating alleles. Multiple genetic mutations were often found in those labeled as having a polygenic cause (none of the three known genetic causes found). &#160;</p><p>In a study of over 20,000 coronary artery disease-free individuals, the prevalence of LDL-C &ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was 6.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Using whole exam sequencing, about 25 percent of these (1.7 percent) had an FH mutation. In patients with very high LDL-C levels (&ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and no FH mutation compared with controls (LDL-C &lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> the risk of coronary artery disease was sixfold higher (odds ratio: 6.0, 95% CI 5.2-6.9). However, in patients with LDL-C &ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and an FH mutation, the risk was 22-fold higher (odds ratio 22.3; 95% CI 10.7-53.2). </p><p>Multiple studies and reviews have evaluated the relationship between apoE genotypes (particularly the apoE4 allele) and both LDL-C and the incidence of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].

One gene that may contribute is the gene for cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which plays a central role in reverse cholesterol transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. CETP moves cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver by transferring cholesteryl ester from HDL-C to apoB-containing lipoproteins with triglyceride transfer in the opposite direction. Increased CETP activity may be proatherogenic and is associated with LDL phenotype B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>LDL phenotype B levels are also influenced by acquired conditions. As an example, they are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the manifestations of the acquired insulin resistance syndrome such as hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased waist-to-hip ratio, low levels of large HDL particles, and systolic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>High hepatic lipase activity hydrolyzes triglyceride in triglyceride-enriched LDL and triglyceride-enriched HDL particles, which results in small, dense LDL particles and smaller HDL particles (HDL-S [HDL3 cholesterol by ultracentrifugation]), and increased HDL particle size. Interventions that alter hepatic lipase activity can reduce the concentration of small, dense LDL particles. Among patients in the FATS trial with a personal and family history of CHD and apoB levels &ge;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> intensive lipid-lowering therapy with lovastatin-colestipol or niacin-colestipol produced a significant reduction in hepatic lipase activity and an increase in large, buoyant LDL particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These changes were associated with a significant improvement in disease severity; in a multivariate analysis, an increase in LDL buoyancy was most strongly associated with regression of CHD, accounting for 37 percent of the variance of change in coronary stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effect of hepatic lipase may be related to a polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene promoter, the most common being a C to T substitution. The presence of a C allele is associated with higher hepatic lipase activity; smaller, denser, and more atherogenic LDL particles; and lower serum HDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The angiographic improvement with lipid lowering is most prominent in subjects with small, dense LDL and lower serum HDL-C, suggesting that hepatic lipase polymorphism might have predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This hypothesis was evaluated in a study of 49 men with established coronary disease and dyslipidemia; patients with the CC genotype had the greatest decrease in hepatic lipase activity, improvement in LDL density, and regression in coronary atherosclerosis (96 versus 60 and 0 percent for TC and TT genotypes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Increase in coronary risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small, dense LDL particles have been consistently associated with CHD in case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/13,47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,47-51</a>]; however, these studies are limited because they did not control for the total LDL particle or apoB concentration. The Stanford Five-City Project evaluated the association between LDL particle diameter with incident fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in a nested case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The study included 124 case-control pairs (90 pairs of men and 34 pairs of women). The patients with MI had a smaller LDL size (mean 26.17 versus 26.68 nm, p&lt;0.001) and there was a graded association across quintiles of LDL size. Small LDL size was a stronger independent predictor of CHD than all other parameters except for the total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio.</p><p>The Physicians' Health Study used a nested case-control study to evaluate whether small, dense LDL particles and nonfasting triglyceride levels were independent predictors for MI in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The study group included 266 cases and 308 controls that were matched for age and smoking status. The cases had a significantly lower average LDL diameter (25.6 versus 25.9 nm, p&lt;0.001) and higher serum triglycerides. Small, dense LDL was associated with higher triglyceride and lower HDL-C levels, and LDL diameter was not an independent risk factor after adjustment for the high triglyceride levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It may be possible to refine the risk associated with small, dense LDL particle size. In a prospective study of over 2000 men, for example, the ability to predict CHD was improved by measuring the cholesterol concentration in the small LDL particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>In addition to determining coronary risk, LDL particle size is also an important predictor of the response to risk-factor reduction. The Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project (SCRIP) was a four-year angiographic trial of multifactorial risk reduction versus usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. LDL particles were classified by density into a &quot;buoyant&quot; (density &lt;1.0378 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL)</span> or &quot;dense&quot; mode (density &gt;1.0378 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/mL)</span>. Cholesterol-lowering therapy produced a significant treatment benefit only in the dense-mode subjects. As noted above, an improvement in LDL density and regression of atherosclerosis appears to be most prominent in patients with the CC genotype for the hepatic lipase gene promoter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Study examined the associations of small, dense LDL versus large buoyant LDL in multivariate models that controlled for the total LDL particle concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this analysis, small, dense LDL was not as closely associated with a similar risk for cardiovascular disease events as large buoyant LDL. </p><p>At any level of LDL-C, individuals with an increased number of small LDL particles have higher LDL particle (LDL-P) concentrations. In multivariate models, LDL-P size is not related to increased cardiovascular risk after adjustment for LDL-P concentration or its surrogate measure apolipoprotein B (apoB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/38,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,53</a>]. Thus, LDL size represents part of the pattern of atherogenic dyslipidemia, and it is not a specific therapeutic target. In individuals with disorders of insulin resistance (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes), LDL-C under-represents cardiovascular risk due to the discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Thus, LDL-P, or its surrogate measure apoB, has been considered a target of therapy, as this measure is associated with a twofold higher risk of cardiovascular disease events than LDL-C. Moreover, in statin-treated patients, apoB levels are more strongly associated with residual cardiovascular risk than LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Based on the high residual cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes patients who achieve current recommended LDL-C targets on statin therapy, we agree with the American Diabetes <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology Foundation-issued consensus statement recommending measurement of apoB (or LDL-P concentration) in patients at high cardiometabolic risk, as well as treatment of high levels of apoB or LDL-P concentration, after therapeutic interventions have been initiated for treatment of LDL-C and non-HDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].
