Alternative options include intraoperative multiple saline wash-outs, intraoperative single-dose application of topical antibiotic or <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/corticosteroid</span> drops, and postoperative prolonged application (typically 3 to 5 days) of topical <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/corticosteroid</span> drops. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Early onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of recurrent TTO in infants and young children involves the same measures used to control recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), including immunization, handwashing, and withdrawal from daycare, if feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-prevention-of-recurrence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Prevention of recurrence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;, section on 'Target groups'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-conjugate-vaccines-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) conjugate vaccines in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water precautions are not generally recommended, although they are advised in certain situations (eg, swimming in a lake, pond, river, or ocean; submerging in a bath; deep diving) and for certain patients (eg, those with active, recurrent, or prolonged otorrhea; those with a prior history of problems with water exposure). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Water precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children two years and younger, TTO is usually caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, and <em>Haemophilus influenza. </em>In cases of TTO that persist despite oral antibiotic therapy and in older children in whom TTO is usually induced by water penetration, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are more prevalent. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with uncomplicated acute TTO (ie, without systemic symptoms, occlusion of the auditory canal, auricular cellulitis, or immunocompromise), we suggest topical therapy with ear drops containing a fluoroquinolone plus a corticosteroid rather than topical aminoglycoside ear drops, oral antibiotics, or observation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In our practice, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> otic suspension, four drops into the affected ear twice daily for five to seven days. Observation is a reasonable alternative for selected patients since some of these episodes resolve spontaneously. Daily suctioning is also advised. (See <a href=\"#H797278\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated acute TTO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest systemic antimicrobial therapy for TTO in infants and children with systemic infection or occlusion of the auditory canal and for children with TTO who are immunocompromised (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> (75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> divided twice daily for 10 days) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> (with high-dose amoxicillin) is typically used as empiric therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Complicated acute TTO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with refractory TTO should be referred to their otolaryngologist for further evaluation and treatment. Antimicrobial therapy for refractory otorrhea should be based upon culture and sensitivity results.
