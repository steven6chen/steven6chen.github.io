Two major issues will be addressed: acute management to terminate the arrhythmia and chronic therapy to prevent recurrence.

The treatment strategy depends upon the patient's presentation and clinical status (hemodynamically stable or unstable). The approach consists of initiating therapy while continuing to assess the patient's condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53559 \">table 1</a>). The following discussion is generally in agreement with the 2010 Pediatrics Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67438\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67438 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Continuous ECG monitoring during therapeutic maneuvers provides insight into the cause of tachycardia and helps in the planning of chronic therapy.</p><p>The most important initial clinical determination to make in children presenting with a tachyarrhythmia is whether there are signs of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, heart failure, shock, or decreased level of consciousness. Unstable patients require immediate intervention to terminate the rhythm.</p><p>Affected children can be asymptomatic except for fussiness or palpitations, or may be unconscious with signs of cardiovascular collapse. The acute management depends on whether the patient is hemodynamically stable or not (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53559 \">table 1</a>).

A narrow complex tachycardia should be converted in synchronous mode, in which a shock is not delivered during the vulnerable repolarization period; this will avoid possible precipitation of ventricular fibrillation.

The ECG pattern seen during termination of the tachycardia can help determine its mechanism.</p><p>The vagal maneuver usually used in infants or young children is application of a bag filled with ice and cold water over the face for 15 to 30 seconds. This elicits the diving reflex, frequently interrupting the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This maneuver is successful in 30 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>].</p><p>Another method that may be successful in infants is rectal stimulation using a thermometer.

The drug is administered by rapid IV injection at a site as close to the central circulation as possible. This is followed immediately by a 5 mL normal saline flush to speed delivery to the heart, which is needed because the drug is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. The patient should be supine and should have ECG and blood pressure monitoring.</p><p>An alternative regimen consists of an initial bolus of 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> if no response is seen within two minutes, the dose is increased by 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> increments every two minutes until termination of the arrhythmia or a maximum dose of 0.25 to 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 12 mg is given.</p><p>The average effective dose is approximately 0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a> is metabolized by an enzyme on the red cell surface, a higher dose is required when given through a peripheral compared with a central vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Adenosine</a> interacts with A1 receptors on the surface of cardiac cells; the resulting effects include slowing of the sinus rate and an increase in the atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This interrupts the reentrant circuit of tachycardias that require the AV node for reentry, which account for the great majority of cases of SVT in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Adenosine</a> terminates 80 to 95 percent of episodes of AVRT, which accounts for almost three-quarters of episodes of SVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and approximately 75 percent of episodes due to other causes of SVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/13,15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,19</a>].

As a result, procainamide may be used safely in patients with WPW syndrome without the risk of provoking accessory pathway conduction. Procainamide has potential for serious adverse effects, and, therefore, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist is advised.

In such patients, we offer the parents the option of expectant management and no specific treatment. We monitor the child for at least 24 hours and teach the parents how to check the heart rate and to terminate SVT episodes using vagal maneuvers (eg, applying an ice bag to the face, performing the Valsalva maneuver, assuming a head-down position, inducing the gag reflex, and other techniques). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Vagal maneuvers'</a> above.)</p><p>The rationale for this strategy is that patients who present at &lt;5 years old have a high likelihood of outgrowing their SVT and may not require chronic therapy, which may be associated with side effects.

In one study, infants with SVT and structurally normal hearts were classified as simple (completely controlled by one medication) or complex (recurrent episodes needing at least one medication change for control) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

For an infant, this consists of the application of an ice bag to the face for 15 to 30 seconds.
