It is typically a self-limited condition with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy. However, KD may cause cardiovascular complications, particularly coronary artery (CA) aneurysms. These, in turn, can lead to coronary occlusion and cardiac ischemia and result in significant morbidity or even mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of CA aneurysm development and associated morbidity and mortality have dramatically decreased as a result of treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). This therapy is effective for preventing CA abnormalities, but the benefits in children who have already developed CA aneurysms are more equivocal. Thus, expeditious diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to achieve the optimal clinical outcome. The initial treatment of KD is discussed in this topic review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, cardiovascular sequelae, and treatment of refractory KD are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-kawasaki-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory Kawasaki disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3881491061\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION OF HIGH-RISK PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theoretically, it should be possible to stratify therapy for KD according to disease severity defined by the likelihood of developing coronary artery (CA) aneurysms. However, no criteria have been developed that can reliably distinguish children who are not at risk of developing severe disease at the time of initial presentation. Thus, all children diagnosed with KD or incomplete KD are treated at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Studies are ongoing to determine what risk factors identify those patients who will not respond to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) treatment and who would therefore benefit from more aggressive initial therapy for KD. The first retrospective study to look at risk factors for refractory KD used the database of the 2003 to 2004 nationwide survey of KD in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the 15,940 patients with KD, 20 percent did not respond to initial IVIG therapy. These nonresponders had a dramatically higher risk for CA aneurysms (odds ratio [OR] 10.38, 95% CI 6.98-15.45) and giant CA aneurysms (OR 54.06, 95% CI 12.84-227.65) compared with responders. One of the risk factors identified was initial treatment at or before the fifth day of illness (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.66-2.15). However, a review of data from the 1997 to 2004 nationwide KD surveys suggests that earlier initial treatment might have reflected more clear-cut and therefore more severe disease at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the high incidence of retreatment among children initially treated before the sixth day of illness could simply support the impression that severe vasculitis requires more aggressive therapy.</p><p>Risk stratification has proven useful in identifying Japanese children with KD at high risk of IVIG resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], but further studies are needed to prospectively validate criteria for identifying high-risk patients in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These studies have led to the addition of glucocorticoids as part of initial therapy in certain patients at high risk for IVIG resistance (refractory KD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H1213989795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for coronary artery aneurysms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-kawasaki-disease#H623748\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory Kawasaki disease&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>The risk of IVIG resistance in Japanese children with KD can be ascertained using the Kobayashi score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114504\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114504 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or other similar validated scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. These scores can be used to determine which patients might benefit from additional initial therapy with glucocorticoids. As an example, the RAISE (Randomized controlled trial to Assess Immunoglobulin plus Steroid Efficacy for Kawasaki disease) trial that examined the addition of glucocorticoids to the initial regimen defined children with KD as high risk for IVIG resistance if they had a Kobayashi score &ge;5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In these populations, different risk factors can identify children in whom significant CA dilatation is likely to occur despite treatment with IVIG. Extrapolating from the RAISE trial, some centers elect to treat such children with adjunct glucocorticoids because they believe that the potential benefits outweigh potential risks. It is important to stress, however, that no data are yet available demonstrating that such an extrapolation is valid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children with enlarged coronary arteries at presentation, prior to IVIG treatment</strong> &ndash; A retrospective study of 500 children with CA aneurysms found that CA Z-scores at presentation were highly predictive of outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The suggested cutoff for initial Z-scores ranges from 2.0 to 3.0, depending upon the desired balance between minimizing unnecessary use of glucocorticoids versus minimizing development of CA aneurysms in the greatest number of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young infants with KD</strong> &ndash; Children under six months of age have up to a 35 percent risk of developing CA aneurysms despite timely treatment with IVIG, and children from 6 to 12 months of age are also at higher risk of failing to respond to IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Young age is included in many risk scores, including the Kobayashi score, and is the most sensitive marker of increased CA risk. Accordingly, it is used by some centers as an independent indication for augmentation of initial therapy with glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children with KD associated with shock</strong> &ndash; Though the literature consists mostly of case reports and case series, children with KD who present with shock are at higher risk of failing to respond to IVIG.

These patients have a higher rate of failing to respond to IVIG and an increased mortality rate. Outcomes are poor in children with KD and MAS whose diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Thus, augmentation of initial IVIG is an attractive option even though it is not clear whether addition of glucocorticoids alone affects outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

A retrospective review evaluated 195 patients with KD who developed coronary artery (CA) aneurysms at four centers in the United States from 1981 to 2006, 53 (27 percent) of whom were not treated for KD, because they did not fulfill diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

IVIG has additional beneficial effects in KD, such as rapid resolution of the almost universal lymphocytic myocarditis seen in the disease. We recommend treating patients who are newly diagnosed with KD with IVIG at a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> to reduce the risk of CA aneurysms. Treatment is most effective if given within the first 7 to 10 days of the illness but is still given after 10 days in patients with persistent fever, ongoing signs of systemic inflammation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CA aneurysms. IVIG is given as a single infusion over 8 to 12 hours. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism of the beneficial effect of IVIG remains unknown. IVIG appears to have a generalized anti-inflammatory effect, with reduction of fever and acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. However, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may rise further after IVIG because positively charged proteins such as immunoglobulins increase the sedimentation of red blood cells, regardless of the degree of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Possible mechanisms by which IVIG improves outcomes in KD include modulating cytokine levels and production, augmenting T cell suppressor activity, downregulating antibody synthesis, and providing anti-idiotypic antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Cost-benefit analysis reveals that IVIG treatment of KD is one of the most cost-effective medical therapies available, leading to tremendous short- and long-term savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVIG with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> is more effective than aspirin alone in decreasing the risk of CA aneurysms, and there is a dose-response effect of IVIG (the highest dose studied is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25-30</a>].

The duration of fever also decreased with increasing IVIG dosing. The relative risks (RRs) of developing CA aneurysms 30 days after receiving varying doses of IVIG plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, compared with aspirin alone, were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IVIG dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.43-1.50)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IVIG dose of 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.92)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IVIG dose of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.15-0.83)</p><p/><p>The dose-response effect of IVIG implies that additional modifications of this treatment regimen might lead to further improvement in outcome. There are no data, however, documenting effects of treating patients with doses greater than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span>. Increasing the dose is limited by the cost and availability of IVIG, as well as by potential side effects. There is also concern for the large volume that is administered to patients who may not be able to tolerate the fluid load, although, in clinical practice, this has not been a significant problem in patients with KD. The potential for additional benefit with the prevalence rate for CA complications already reduced fivefold with standard therapy also is not clear. Nevertheless, the dose response to IVIG provides the theoretical basis for the practice of IVIG retreatment of patients who have persistent or recrudescent fever after initial IVIG therapy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-kawasaki-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory Kawasaki disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized, controlled studies comparing IVIG therapy alone with combined IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> therapy. In one retrospective report from Taiwan, IVIG 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> was administered initially to patients without concomitant aspirin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Low-dose aspirin (as an antiplatelet agent) was subsequently prescribed following resolution of fever. In 128 of 162 patients (80 percent), fever resolved within 24 hours of completion of IVIG therapy. At the time of diagnosis, 10 percent of patients had CA aneurysms. Subsequent CA aneurysms formed in 3 percent of patients whose fever normalized within 24 hours of completing IVIG therapy. These results are comparable with those seen in studies of children treated initially with both IVIG and aspirin. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> below.)</p><p>The beneficial effects of IVIG are not limited to the prevention of CA aneurysms. Echocardiographic data suggest that another common manifestation of KD, depressed myocardial contractility, also may be more rapidly reversed by IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVIG is most effective when administered in a single infusion given over 8 to 12 hours.

There are few data on the efficacy of IVIG therapy administered more than 10 days after the onset of KD in preventing CA aneurysms. The AHA and AAP guidelines recommend that IVIG be administered to children with KD within the first 10 days of illness and, if possible, within the first seven days of illness because the rate at which children with KD develop aneurysms increases significantly after the ninth day of illness. Nonetheless, IVIG should still be administered to patients with KD who present after the 10<sup>th</sup> day of illness if they have persistent fever without another explanation, aneurysms, or evidence of ongoing systemic inflammation (eg, elevated CRP or ESR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Two retrospective studies reported a lower incidence of cardiac sequelae and a shorter duration of clinical symptoms (eg, fever) for patients treated before day 5 or 6 of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. On the other hand, in the nationwide surveys of KD in Japan, there was no difference in the incidence of CA aneurysms between 4731 patients treated early (&le;day 4 of illness) and 4020 patients treated between days 5 and 9. However, patients treated early were more likely to require retreatment with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,4,5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,11</a>].

A case-control study of 150 children treated with IVIG 10 to 20 days (cases) or 4 to 8 days (controls) after the onset of illness found that the rate of coronary artery lesions (CALs; dilatation or aneurysm) during the convalescent period was significantly higher in cases (27 percent) versus controls (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the effectiveness of IVIG treatment after 10 days was unclear because approximately one-half of patients in the late group had already developed CALs before receiving IVIG. In fact, among patients without CALs before treatment with IVIG, the percentage developing de novo CALs after treatment was 8 percent in both the early- and late-treated groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of intravenous immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVIG is a biologic product pooled from donor plasma that undergoes a number of manufacturing procedures including different methods of sterilization. These processes may result in variable efficacy in treating patients with KD among the different brands of IVIG. However, data are not sufficient to identify a brand of IVIG that is most efficacious in the treatment of KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite its advantages, IVIG is an expensive and potentially toxic intervention. Significant hemolysis requiring transfusion can occur within 5 to 10 days of infusion due to isoagglutinins in the IVIG products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of hemolysis is dose related and is particularly increased in patients who receive more than one dose of IVIG. Children with non-type O blood are also at increased risk of developing significant hemolysis following IVIG therapy.</p><p>The greatest long-term concern with any blood product is the potential transmission of bloodborne pathogens. As an example, more than 100 cases of hepatitis C occurred in recipients of a single brand of IVIG in 1994 (none were in children with KD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Since that time, manufacturers have introduced a variety of elaborate sterilization procedures including lyophilization, pasteurization, and addition of solvent detergents. These are generally effective in rendering the product free of at least lipid-soluble viruses so that transmission of hepatitis C is no longer a risk. However, other pathogens, such as parvovirus, might escape neutralization by these procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Other stages of the purification of IVIG may inactivate detergent-resistant viruses, and confirmed reports of transmission of viruses are rare with available preparations of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Clinicians should remain cognizant of such risks, but significant toxicity is rare, and the benefits outweigh risks in children with confirmed KD. The adverse effects of IVIG are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Aspirin</a> was one of the first treatments used for KD because of its anti-inflammatory effects (eg, reduction in the duration of fever) and antiplatelet effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, it is unclear if the addition of aspirin provides greater anti-inflammatory effects than does IVIG alone. Several meta-analyses have shown that aspirin does not affect aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The question of whether the benefits of aspirin warrant its continued use in KD is unlikely to be answered since all prospective studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of IVIG in treating KD also employed moderate to high doses of aspirin.</p><p>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> used to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect during the acute phase of illness is relatively high, with a recommended range of 30 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in four divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,23,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,45,46</a>].

Once fever has been absent for 48 hours, patients are generally switched to a low dose of aspirin, 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, for its antiplatelet effect. This low-dose aspirin regimen is continued until laboratory markers of acute inflammation (eg, platelet count and ESR) return to normal, unless CA abnormalities are detected by echocardiography.</p><p>CRP usually normalizes within one to two weeks of IVIG treatment; however, normalization of ESR typically takes an additional one to two months. Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> therapy generally is complete within two months of the onset of disease in children with no CA abnormalities. Alternative regimens, such as treatment with high-dose aspirin until the 14<sup>th</sup> day after fever onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] or low-dose aspirin (ASA; 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> from the start of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], are used by other practitioners. Other anti-inflammatory agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, may be used if the patient also has prolonged episodes of arthritis. The antithrombotic regimen for patients with persistent CA aneurysms is reviewed in greater detail separately.

The previously mentioned review of six randomized, controlled studies, which evaluated varying doses of IVIG and aspirin, demonstrated no difference in the prevalence of CA aneurysms between patients receiving moderate-dose aspirin (30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and those receiving high-dose aspirin (80 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risk of CA aneurysms was only dependent upon IVIG dose. For each IVIG dose, the risk of CA aneurysms was the same in each of the aspirin subgroups when evaluated at 30 days (subacute) and 60 days (convalescent) after diagnosis. This suggests that aspirin at any dose does not affect the incidence of CA changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2337643802\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited observational data also suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> offers little additional benefit to initial IVIG therapy. In the previously mentioned retrospective study of 162 children with KD, 80 percent of the 153 patients who received a single dose of IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> with no concomitant aspirin therapy had resolution of fever within 24 hours of completing IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The incidence of subsequent CA aneurysms in this study was 3 percent in the patients who received IVIG therapy alone. This is similar to the rates seen in studies of patients treated with combined therapy of IVIG 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> and aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Several retrospective studies have examined different <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> doses, with no differences seen in the rate of CA abnormalities. In a retrospective study from Taiwan, children with KD received either &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of aspirin until the fever resolved and then 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of aspirin (n = 305) or low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> from the onset of initial treatment (n = 546). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to IVIG resistance rate, CA lesion formation, or duration of hospitalization. The group on initial moderate-to-high-dose aspirin had significantly lower levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of CRP and hepcidin compared with the low-dose aspirin group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In another retrospective study, children with KD at two Canadian centers received either low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> from diagnosis or initial high-dose aspirin (80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> used for a mean of 4.5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The odds of IVIG resistance was greater in the low-dose aspirin group (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.1) in a multivariable logistic regression analysis, with a second dose of IVIG given in <span class=\"nowrap\">28/122</span> patients (23 percent) in the low-dose group compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">11/127</span> (7.3 percent) in the high-dose group.

A retrospective, nonrandomized cohort study avoided some of the risks of other retrospective studies by comparing outcomes at three institutions that routinely used high-dose aspirin (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> to outcomes at three centers that used low-dose aspirin (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day),</span> rather than different doses used at the same institution (potential bias by indication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Overall, 1213 subjects were included, 848 receiving high-dose and 365 low-dose aspirin. There were no differences in the risk of CA abnormalities in the low-dose versus high-dose groups (22.2 versus 20.5 percent, 95% CI -4.5 to 5.0 percent).

Theoretically, these risks may be increased in patients with KD. Aspirin-binding studies have suggested that the hypoalbuminemia of children with KD predisposes them to toxic levels of free salicylate despite measured (total) salicylate levels within the therapeutic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The recommended therapeutic regimens are designed to maintain any potential beneficial effects of aspirin in KD while minimizing the risk of toxicity by lowering the dose to antiplatelet levels as soon as inflammation is improving.

In a retrospective Japanese cohort study of 176 patients with severe KD, the rate of bradycardia (heart rate less than the first percentile for normal children) in patients who received initial therapy with IVIG plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> from February 2012 onward was significantly higher compared with those treated with IVIG alone prior to this date (79 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

The highest incidence was in children less than three years of age who had cardiac sequelae during the first episode. Recurrences most commonly occurred within the first 12 months after the initial episode of KD.</p><p>In this report, however, a recurrent episode was defined as rehospitalization of a patient who satisfied the diagnostic criteria for KD. In order to determine a true recurrence rate, follow-up studies must use a more precise definition of recurrence: a separate episode fulfilling KD criteria after an earlier occurrence has fully resolved, typically at least two months later. Episodes that occur sooner may well represent recrudescent or persistent KD and not truly recurrent disease.

The temperature should also be taken if the child feels warm or recurrent clinical signs of KD seem to be developing. Such heightened vigilance continues until the next outpatient follow-up visit, which usually occurs 7 to 10 days after discharge. Any child who develops a fever should be evaluated for recurrence of other manifestations of inflammation, for interval coronary artery (CA) dilatation on echocardiogram, and for other causes of fever. These patients should be retreated for presumed recrudescence of KD unless there is clear evidence of another explanation for fever.

Children who remain clinically well following IVIG therapy and have a normal echocardiogram at two weeks seldom develop new abnormalities. Conversely, those with CA aneurysms, or those at higher risk for developing CA dilatation, warrant more frequent echocardiograms.
