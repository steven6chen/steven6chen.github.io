However, subsets of patients at increased risk of recurrence can be defined based upon the characteristics of the primary tumor (thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration) or the presence of lymph node metastases. (See <a href=\"#H157827536\" class=\"local\">'General approach to adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lymph node involvement (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663%7EONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 graphicRef110664 \">table 1A-B</a>)) and those with stage IV disease who have undergone definitive resection of all sites of disease are at significantly increased risk for recurrence and death from melanoma, and adjuvant immunotherapies and targeted therapies are now available that have been shown to improve survival in these patients. Selection of a specific agent depends largely on <em>BRAF</em> mutation status and toxicity profiles. (See <a href=\"#H278152576\" class=\"local\">'Stage III disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In most patients whose tumor is <em>BRAF</em> wild type or unknown, we recommend adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2582712797\" class=\"local\">'Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients whose tumor contains a <em>BRAF</em> V600 mutation, we suggest adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> rather than targeted therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Both have been shown to improve survival, but they have not been compared directly. Our preference for nivolumab in most patients is based on the safety and tolerability profile. (See <a href=\"#H3784284259\" class=\"local\">'Nivolumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4217444200\" class=\"local\">'Targeted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with stage IIIA disease, regardless of <em>BRAF</em> mutation status, the chance of disease recurrence is less than 20 percent, and therefore, observation should also be considered an option. (See <a href=\"#H157827536\" class=\"local\">'General approach to adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at increased risk of recurrence with stage II melanoma (primary tumor &gt;4 mm, or &gt;2 mm with ulceration) were also excluded from the phase III <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> versus ipilimumab trials. Adjuvant therapy with checkpoint inhibitors or targeted agents has not been evaluated in this patient population. Despite the increased risk of recurrence, adjuvant therapy is not generally recommended because of the toxicity associated with adjuvant therapy and the relatively favorable prognosis compared with those with lymph node involvement, as well as the relatively high likelihood of significant benefit from systemic therapy in the small subset of patients who do ultimately relapse. (See <a href=\"#H157827560\" class=\"local\">'High-risk node-negative (stage IIB or IIC) disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical trial enrollment with a checkpoint inhibitor or targeted therapy may be an alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at low risk of recurrence (no lymph node involvement and tumor &le;4 mm in thickness without ulceration or &le;2 mm in thickness with ulceration, stage IIA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663%7EONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 graphicRef110664 \">table 1A-B</a>)), there is a high probability of cure.
