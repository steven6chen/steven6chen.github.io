The ectocervix (surface of the cervix that is visualized on vaginal speculum examination) is covered in squamous epithelium, and the endocervix, including the cervical canal, is covered with glandular epithelium. CIN refers to squamous abnormalities. Glandular cervical neoplasia includes adenocarcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma.

Hysterectomy is an option for women who are incompletely treated with excision or ablation or who have recurrent CIN. Nonsurgical treatments are investigational. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518602\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical excision versus ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablation is rarely performed in the United States because it has few advantages compared with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Both types of procedures can be performed in an office setting and are associated with a low morbidity rate. Excisional procedures provide a diagnostic specimen, which is a significant advantage. There is no evidence that either ablation or excision is more effective, but the available studies have methodologic limitations and do not clearly address CIN 1 and CIN 2,3 separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excisional</strong> <strong>treatments</strong> are referred to as cone biopsies or cervical conization, because they typically consist of the removal of a cone-shaped specimen that includes the transformation zone and a portion of the endocervix. Cold knife conization (performed with a scalpel) has been largely replaced by LEEP, also called large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). Laser conization is another technique. Conization techniques and decisions regarding the choice of excisional procedure are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;, section on 'Comparison of methods'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ablative treatments </strong>use an energy source (eg, cryotherapy, laser) to destroy the transformation zone. Ablative techniques and decisions regarding the choice of ablative method are discussed separately.

There are few high-quality studies comparing the efficacy of excision versus ablation. Additional factors that influence the decision are risk of adverse effects, cost, and convenience. </p><p>The sections below review the evidence and clinical considerations regarding the choice of excisional or ablative therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518618\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with CIN 2,3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is required for CIN 2,3, with the exception of selected young women. For young women with CIN 2,3 and an adequate colposcopy, either observation or treatment is acceptable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H2854058\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H2854050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Young women'</a>.)</p><p>For most women with CIN 2,3 with an adequate colposcopy, we suggest treatment with excision rather than ablation. In general, LEEP is preferred over cold knife cone because it can be performed in the office setting. For women with CIN 2,3 with an inadequate colposcopy, recurrent CIN 2,3, or endocervical sampling with CIN 2,3, we recommend excision rather than ablation.</p><p>Data are limited regarding the efficacy of excision versus ablation for CIN 2,3. However, in our practice, we prefer excision for all women treated for CIN 2,3 because it provides a diagnostic specimen, and these women have a higher risk of progression to invasive disease.

For women with CIN 1 with a prior cytologic sample reported as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), or normal cytology in the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 or 18, recommended follow-up is cotesting with cytology and an HPV test at one year. For women with CIN 1 and a preceding cytologic test of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out HSIL (ASC-H), either an excisional procedure or observation with cotesting at 12 months and 24 months are recommended. Women with CIN 1 that persists for at least two years may continue follow-up or may undergo treatment.

There are few high-quality data comparing excision with ablation, and the randomized trials that exist do not provide information regarding use of these techniques in women with CIN 1 compared with CIN 2,3. </p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized trials of treatment in women with any degree of CIN included five trials that compared an excisional method with an ablative method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There were insufficient data to make an overall comparison between excision and ablation. </p><p>LEEP was found to superior to cryotherapy in one trial, although the results were not analyzed by CIN grade. In this trial, LEEP resulted in a significantly lower rate of residual disease at 12-month follow-up compared with cryotherapy (3.6 versus 11.2 percent; relative risk 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.78); however, this was based on few events (six cases of residual disease in the LEEP group and 18 in the cryotherapy group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There was no significant difference in the rate of residual disease between methods in most trials, but the majority of these lacked statistical power. Because of this limitation, it remains unclear whether laser ablation is as effective as conization. In women with high-grade disease, the risk of forgoing diagnostic information and missing a cervical cancer requires that use of any therapy other than excision be supported by high quality evidence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518643\"><span class=\"h4\">Diagnostic specimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal difference between the two types of procedures is that no specimen is removed in ablative procedures, and thus, there is no diagnostic information and no information regarding whether disease is present at the margins of the treated area. For this reason, an excisional procedure is required for diagnostic purposes in the following situations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk of invasive disease &ndash; For women in whom cervical cancer is suspected, it is crucial to obtain diagnostic information and evaluation of surgical margins. Use of p-16 staining may improve classification and risk stratification of these lesions. However, reporting of p-16 status is not universally available. (See <a href=\"#H518703\" class=\"local\">'Positive margins'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H20896350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)<br/><br/>The incidence of occult squamous carcinoma and glandular disease detected by conization was illustrated in a study of 1189 patients who underwent LEEP; six patients (0.5 percent) had microinvasive squamous carcinoma and 15 (1.3 percent) had adenocarcinoma in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Two (33 percent) of the squamous carcinomas and 10 (67 percent) of the adenocarcinomas in situ were not recognized by cytology and colposcopy. Another series of 3738 women who underwent laser ablation for CIN reported nine cervical cancers (0.24 percent) during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glandular disease is present &ndash; Glandular disease may be located in the transformation zone or endocervical canal and lesions are often not contiguous (&quot;skip lesions&quot;), so colposcopically directed biopsy of the transformation zone is insufficient for diagnosis. As noted in the study of 1189 patients described above, this may result in occult glandular neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, women with an inadequate colposcopic examination may require a diagnostic excisional biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518651\"><span class=\"h4\">Future obstetric risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excision has been associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes (second trimester pregnancy loss, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery) in large observational studies. In clinics in which ablation is not available, LEEP is the preferred excisional method because it appears to be associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery than cold knife conization. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Reproductive effects of treatment&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518659\"><span class=\"h4\">Morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excisional methods are typically thought to be associated with greater morbidity than ablative therapy. However, the meta-analysis of randomized trials found no significant difference in adverse effects (eg, hemorrhage, pain) and some trials showed a trend toward less morbidity with excisional methods (eg, LEEP versus laser ablation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].<br/><br/>However, women planning a subsequent pregnancy may prefer to take some risk of disease recurrence to offset the risk of preterm delivery. These women should be offered the choice of either laser ablation or excision and counseled about the risks and benefits of each. (See <a href=\"#H518651\" class=\"local\">'Future obstetric risks'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518671\"><span class=\"h2\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy is not a first-line treatment for CIN because the risk of significant morbidity with hysterectomy is higher than with less invasive treatment modalities (excision, ablation). Hysterectomy is reserved for women with CIN 2,3 with a positive conization margin who have completed childbearing and who would benefit from a definitive procedure. For women with a histologic diagnosis of recurrent or persistent CIN 2,3, either a repeat diagnostic excisional procedure or hysterectomy is appropriate. Hysterectomy may be necessary in women with scarring or shortening of the cervix from prior treatments that prohibits a repeat excisional procedure. Scarring may increase the risk of complications of a repeat conization or limit the results of further testing (ie, scarring may obscure premalignant cells). In addition, a definitive procedure is preferable for women who are not willing or able to comply with long-term follow-up.</p><p>If invasive disease is suspected, a conization may be performed and sent for frozen section prior to hysterectomy to confirm that cervical cancer is not present and that a radical hysterectomy is not indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518679\"><span class=\"h2\">Other treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several alternative methods for treatment of CIN have been developed, all of which are currently investigational.

Five patients developed microinvasive disease and one patient developed stage 1B carcinoma.</p><p>Post-treatment HPV status was found to be somewhat more effective than positive margins in predicting recurrence in a meta-analysis that included 128 studies and over 40,000 women treated with conization for CIN 2+ and followed for at least 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Positive margins were found in 23.1 percent. Based on data from 25 studies, the risk of residual or recurrent CIN 2+ was increased in women with positive margins (relative risk 4.8, 95% CI 3&middot;2-7&middot;2). Based on 18 studies, the sensitivity and specificity to predict subsequent CIN 2+ were: margin status (56 and 84 percent); high-risk HPV status (91 and 84 percent); combination of both margin and HPV status (99 and 58 percent). Absolute CIN 2+ risks associated with each measure were: negative margins (0.8 percent); positive margins (17 percent); HPV-negative (0.8 percent); and HPV-positive (28 percent). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518711\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative excisional specimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A completely negative excisional specimen raises concern that the lesion was missed.

The recurrence rate after a negative LEEP was similar to that after a LEEP with a positive margin (24 versus 27 percent), and 24 percent of these patients had subsequent neoplastic findings, including two carcinomas and eight high-grade lesions, after a median follow-up of two years.

If both tests were negative at six months, the risk of persistent or recurrent CIN 2,3 was 4.6 percent; if both tests were negative at 6 and 24 months, the risk was 1.8 percent. By contrast, if either test was positive at six months, the risk of persistent CIN 2,3 or worse was 45 to 60 percent, indicating the need for immediate evaluation and treatment for these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717280032\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have a history of CIN 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ and who have been appropriately treated or had spontaneous regression of cervical neoplasia should be routinely screened for at least 20 years following diagnosis, even if this extends screening past age 65 years, based upon guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, the American Cancer Society, and the American Society for Clinical Pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Women with a history of CIN 2,3 in the past 20 years appear to have a 5- to 10-fold higher risk of cervical cancer compared with the general population. This is based upon data from longitudinal studies. One retrospective study included over 37,000 women in a British Columbia, Canada database. At 18 years after treatment, the rate of cervical cancer was higher in women treated for CIN (81 percent with CIN 2,3, the remainder had CIN 1) compared with women without CIN (37 versus 6 per 100,000 woman-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, a systematic review of retrospective studies of women treated for CIN reported a rate of cervical cancer of 56 per 100,000 woman-years until 20 years after treatment; only three studies followed women for 16 to 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>While the professional societies' recommendation for prolonged screening applies only to women with CIN 2,3, a major limitation of the data cited above is that they include women treated for CIN 1. Other data show that the risk of cervical cancer following CIN 1 is significantly lower than for CIN 2,3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H6303884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignant disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H574899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignant disease'</a>.)</p><p>An additional challenge regarding screening women with CIN 2,3 for 20 years is that confirmation of this diagnosis is often difficult. Many women do not recall their history over this period of time or may not have been told a specific diagnosis, and medical records are not always accessible. In our practice, we ask all patients about their cervical cancer screening history. If the patient is certain that she had a conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure, we regard her as having a history of CIN 2,3. If she reports a history of cryotherapy or a history of &quot;an abnormal Pap smear,&quot; we regard her history as uncertain. In addition, some women with a history of CIN 2,3 may report a normal screening history. We obtain medical records whenever possible. </p><p>Cervical cancer screening is discussed in detail separately.

In a retrospective study of over 8000 women with abnormal cervical cytology, 19 percent were lost to follow-up, including 8 percent of those with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. During a period of time when a patient is lost to follow-up, lesions may regress or worsen and re-evaluation is often necessary.</p><p>When a patient is diagnosed with CIN 2,3 and treatment is delayed, in our practice, we proceed with the planned treatment without re-evaluation if the interval from the time of diagnosis is up to 6 to 12 months. Once the treatment delay has been more than 12 months, we reassess the patient with cervical cytology, colposcopy, biopsy, and ECC. In such cases, the goals of reevaluation are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclude the development of a lesion suspicious for microinvasive or invasive carcinoma. In the case of a suspected microinvasive carcinoma, a conization would be indicated. In the case of a gross lesion suspicious for cancer, all that may be needed is a cervical biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and conization of a gross lesion would and should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the patient for potential resolution of her high-grade lesion. As discussed above, regression is particularly likely in the postpartum patients and young women and particularly important for any young patient who is desirous of future fertility for whom the treatment-associated risk of preterm delivery has to be considered in the context of higher spontaneous regression rates of CIN 2,3.

This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 19 studies with 6543 women with no history of CIN who underwent hysterectomy; during follow-up, 1.8 percent had an abnormal vaginal cytology result and 0.12 percent had VAIN, and there were no vaginal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. For this reason, screening guidelines in the United States from the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concur that most women do not need posthysterectomy vaginal cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/65,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,68-70</a>].

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends ongoing screening of these women for at least 20 years after treatment of CIN 2,3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This recommendation is based upon studies that found that the risk of invasive cervical cancer among these women remains greater than that among the general population of women, and the increased risk persists for as long as 20 to 25 years (56 per 100,000 woman-years versus 5.6 per 100,000 woman-years in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. For women who undergo total hysterectomy, there is a low risk of vaginal cancer. As an example, the meta-analysis of 19 studies reported the following rates of abnormal vaginal findings in women with CIN: women with CIN 1,2 (3.1 percent abnormal cytology; 1.3 percent abnormal biopsy; no cancers) and CIN 3 (14.1 percent abnormal cytology; 1.7 percent abnormal biopsy; one vaginal cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

CIN refers to squamous, not glandular, abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H521439\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstays of treatment of CIN are excision or ablation of the transformation zone of the cervix (an anatomic area that contains the transition from the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix to the glandular epithelium of the endocervix). Hysterectomy is an option for women who are incompletely treated with excision or ablation. (See <a href=\"#H518594\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with CIN 1, follow-up is required. Women with CIN 1 that persists for at least two years may continue follow-up or may undergo treatment. For women with CIN 1 who undergo treatment, we suggest loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) rather than conization or ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with CIN 2,3 with an adequate colposcopy, we suggest treatment with excision rather than ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For women with CIN 2,3 with an inadequate colposcopy, recurrent CIN 2,3, or endocervical sampling with CIN 2,3, we recommend excision rather than ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy is not a first-line treatment for CIN. Hysterectomy is a reasonable option only for women with CIN 2,3 who have a positive conization margin, who have completed childbearing, and who value a definitive procedure more than avoiding potential operative complications. (See <a href=\"#H518671\" class=\"local\">'Hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical treatments (excision or ablation) reduce the risk of invasive cancer of the cervix by 95 percent in the first eight years after therapy. Most failures occur within two years, but recurrences may occur up to 20 years later.
