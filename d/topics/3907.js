The restricted leaflets typically have a conical or dome-shaped appearance during systole, with an orifice in a shape similar to a &quot;fish-mouth&quot;. Calcification of the stenotic valve is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In addition to pulmonary stenosis, there may be pulmonary artery dilation as a consequence of underlying connective tissue abnormality and eccentric flow due to the stenotic valve. If pulmonic valve stenosis is sufficiently severe, right ventricular hypertrophy may occur over time. Right ventricular chamber enlargement is not expected in patients with pulmonic stenosis unless there is associated pulmonary regurgitation.</p><p>A small proportion of patients (particularly those with Noonan syndrome) have a markedly dysplastic valve, with prominent leaflet thickening, little commissural fusion, and often a hypoplastic annulus and proximal pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

In comparison, varying degrees of secondary outflow tract narrowing are commonly seen as part of the overall muscular hypertrophy of the right ventricle induced by pulmonic stenosis. This secondary obstruction often regresses following valvotomy or valvuloplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and treatment of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is one of the cardinal features of tetralogy of Fallot.

It is rare as a de novo finding in adults but can be seen in children either as part of another congenital defect or as an isolated abnormality. Right ventricular pressure overload is seen at catheterization, and angiography usually demonstrates multiple focal or diffuse areas of stenosis. When isolated, it occurs most often at the left pulmonary artery takeoff, presumably due to changes related to the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty may offer these patients successful short-term reduction in right ventricular hypertension and alleviation of symptoms.</p><p>Pulmonary arterial stenosis often occurs in association with other cardiac or noncardiac congenital defects. These include tetralogy of Fallot and the congenital rubella syndrome as well as rarer disorders such as Williams syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Alagille syndrome, and LEOPARD syndrome. Branch pulmonary stenosis are a potential sequelae of prior Blalock-Taussig shunts and both main and branch pulmonary stenosis may result from the arterial switch repair of transposition of the great arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-d-transposition-of-the-great-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of D-transposition of the great arteries&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival into adulthood is common in patients with pulmonic stenosis, even in the absence of surgical correction or valvotomy. However, fibrous thickening and occasionally calcification of the valve with age may result in decreased valve mobility and increased obstruction. Thus, the patient who is initially asymptomatic may begin to experience symptoms that vary from mild exertional dyspnea to signs and symptoms of right heart failure, depending upon the severity of obstruction and the degree of myocardial compensation. Moderate to severe obstruction may lead to an inability to augment pulmonary blood flow during exertion, resulting in exercise-induced fatigue, syncope, or chest pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and treatment of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical findings are related to severity of stenosis, thus the findings in adults with pulmonic stenosis are often subtle, since most patients have mild to moderate disease. The typical constellation includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominence of the jugular venous &quot;A&quot; wave, although overall jugular venous pressure is usually normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent right ventricular systolic impulse with a left para-sternal lift.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systolic ejection murmur with maximal intensity at the left upper sternal border. The murmur duration increases with increasing degrees of stenosis at valve level, and its peak intensity occurs later in systole. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.) In patients with milder stenosis, the murmur will vary with respiration. The murmur radiates to the back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pulmonary ejection sound (or click). Presence of this high frequency component usually denotes a mild or moderate degree of stenosis, since it occurs earlier in systole with severe stenosis, and eventually becomes &quot;buried&quot; in the first heart sound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The ejection click decreases in intensity with inspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splitting of the second heart sound results from prolonged ejection and delay in the pulmonic component. The degree of splitting increases with more severe stenosis, and may become fixed in the most severe forms due to a fixed right ventricular output or development of conduction delay.

Pulmonic regurgitation may also be detected as a decrescendo, diastolic murmur; this finding is more prevalent following valvotomy or valvuloplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

If image quality is inadequate by echocardiography, CMR is an option to assess severity of valve disease and impact on the right ventricle. For those patients who may have more complex anatomy, MRI can more accurately delineate anatomy of the right heart and pulmonary arteries. In patients with pulmonary regurgitation, CMR is valuable in clinical decision making because it can more accurately measure right ventricular volume and function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical concerns are shared equally among those with varying severity of pulmonic stenosis, regardless of the type of treatment given (medical or surgical).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Infective endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of infective endocarditis in patients with pulmonic stenosis followed to adulthood is very low compared to other types of valvular heart disease (0.9 per 10,000 person-years versus 27.1 for those with aortic stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, the risk is a little more than twice that in the general population (0.38 per 10,000 person-years).</p><p>In addition, there are currently no data regarding the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with pulmonic stenosis because of the relatively low incidence of endocarditis. Furthermore, the risk of anaphylactic reactions to antibiotic prophylaxis may be as common as the incidence of endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The 2007 American Heart Association guidelines on the prevention of bacterial endocarditis recommended that only patients with the highest risk of the development of endocarditis receive antimicrobial prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most patients with valvular heart disease, including those with pulmonic stenosis, are not included in this group unless they have had prior endocarditis or have a prosthetic valve.
