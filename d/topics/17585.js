In 2015, the annual mortality rate for prevalent United States dialysis patients was 181 <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/1000</span> patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cardiac disease is the major cause of death, accounting for approximately 37 percent of all-cause mortality in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database, the single, largest, specific cause of death is attributed to arrhythmic mechanisms or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, the term sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been used, even if a patient was successfully resuscitated. Such cases have been referred to as &quot;aborted SCD&quot; or &quot;resuscitated SCD,&quot; and patients who experienced such events were said to be &quot;sudden death survivors.&quot; Clearer and more rational definitions of SCA and SCD were proposed in 2006 by the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/HRS)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p>&quot;[Sudden] cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation. If corrective measures are not taken rapidly, this condition progresses to sudden death. Cardiac arrest should be used to signify an event as described above, that is reversed, usually by CPR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> defibrillation or cardioversion, or cardiac pacing. Sudden cardiac death should not be used to describe events that are not fatal.&quot;</p><p>Throughout this topic review, we will use the terms &quot;SCA&quot; and &quot;SCD&quot; as defined in the 2006 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> document.</p><p>The treatment of SCA and the prevention of SCD in the dialysis population are provided in this topic review. Detailed discussions of SCA in the patient without kidney disease and the epidemiology and evaluation of SCA in dialysis patients are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of SCA consists of acute resuscitation, which is the same in patients with and without renal failure. With respect to those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), electrolyte issues are particularly important in this setting. Thus, the 2006 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/European</span> Society of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/ESC)</span> guidelines state the following: &quot;The acute management of ventricular arrhythmias in end-stage renal failure should immediately address hemodynamic status and electrolyte (potassium, magnesium, and calcium) imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supportive data for advanced cardiac life support in adults with sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">External defibrillators in the dialysis unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the majority of SCA events in dialysis patients do not occur during the delivery of hemodialysis, those that do provide the opportunity for rapid and appropriate interventions that may improve survival. A specific issue in the hemodialysis population is whether external defibrillators should be present in all dialysis units to facilitate prompt defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation <span class=\"nowrap\">(VF)/ventricular</span> tachycardia (VT).</p><p>The rationale is that overall success depends in part on how quickly defibrillation is performed, as well as the high rate of SCA in dialysis units. It is estimated, for example, that the SCA rate in dialysis units is 3.8 to 7 per 100,000 hemodialysis sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>There are a few studies that provide detailed data on cardiac arrest and arrhythmia occurring during dialysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of 47 SCAs occurring in dialysis centers in Seattle and King County (United States) found that the annual incidence was approximately 0.75 SCA events per center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In 29 patients (62 percent), the cardiac rhythm was VF or VT, with an overall survival to hospital discharge of 30 percent for the whole group and 38 percent for the <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study reported the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (including SCA) in one Montreal, Canada dialysis center during the period from 1997 to 2004 that involved over 307,553 dialysis sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An arrhythmia was identified in 19 patients; VT or VF was documented in six (32 percent). A total of 24 SCAs were reported, with 18 patients (75 percent) surviving 30 days and 14 patients (58 percent) surviving 60 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third retrospective study evaluated 102 SCAs occurring at a dialysis center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among 72 cases, the initial abnormality was VF or VT. Survival was only 15 percent at one year among those who survived transportation to the hospital.</p><p/><p>Given the frequency of SCAs in dialysis units, these data would suggest that onsite defibrillation capability in all dialysis centers would be beneficial. A large amount of published data suggest that health care workers can use automated external defibrillators (AEDs) safely and effectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, limited data suggest that AEDs in dialysis centers may not provide a significant survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study, there was no significant difference in one-year survival after SCA in centers with and without AEDs (8.8 and 7.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One key question from this study is how cardiac arrest survivors from dialysis units were subsequently managed. The long-term benefit of successful onsite defibrillation may be attenuated by recurrent, future cardiac events if the surviving patients received no further interventions, such as the treatment of myocardial ischemia or defibrillator implantation.</p><p>Even when an AED is available, the device may not be appropriately used. In one study, for example, an AED was found to be attached prior to the arrival of emergency personnel in only 50 percent of dialysis patients with SCA who were being treated in centers with AEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The reasons for the underutilization of this device are unclear.</p><p>Despite these limited data, we agree with the 2005 National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease in Dialysis Patients, which recommend basic life support (CPR) training for dialysis unit staff and onsite capability for external cardiac defibrillation, either with an AED or standard manual defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paucity of evidence exists concerning the prevention of SCA in dialysis patients. This is principally because of the exclusion of dialysis patients from nearly all clinical trials that used SCA or sudden cardiac death (SCD) as an endpoint and the absence of any subgroup analyses on those occasions when this population was included.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures unique to dialysis patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to general measures for primary and secondary prevention of SCA in the dialysis patient is unclear. It may vary in part with the dialysis patient's risk of SCA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Risk factors and causes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dialysate composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dialysis patients are generally at increased risk of SCA, cardiac arrest during hemodialysis remains a particular concern. Modification of the dialysate composition, particularly potassium and calcium concentration, may alter the risk of cardiac arrest.</p><p>An increased risk of cardiac arrest may be associated with a low potassium concentration in the dialysate. In a retrospective study of dialysis unit-based cardiac arrest, patients who suffered a cardiac arrest at the time of dialysis were twice as likely to be dialyzed against a 0 or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> potassium dialysate bath compared with controls, despite the same predialysis potassium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another study found an independent twofold increase in sudden death for patients dialyzed with a potassium bath of &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this study, there was no evidence for a benefit of low-potassium dialysate, even among patients with higher predialysis serum potassium levels. In another study of 37,765 participants, compared with dialysate potassium &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> dialysate concentrations &le;1.5 and &le;2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> were associated with increased risk of SCD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.74 and HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.37, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The magnitude of the association of SCD with dialysis potassium &le;1.5 was greater among patients with serum potassium &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>Given this increased hazard of cardiac arrest, it is prudent to avoid the use of low-potassium dialysate baths, when feasible (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> potassium). However, the nephrologist is presented with a very difficult problem in medically noncompliant patients who routinely have chronic hyperkalemia. In such patients, scheduling more frequent dialysis sessions is preferred, if possible, to the use of very low potassium dialysate baths, particularly in light of the study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This approach reduces the magnitude of acute intradialytic potassium changes and permits the use of higher potassium baths, thereby avoiding postsession hypokalemia. However, if more frequent dialysis sessions are not feasible, the nephrologist may not have the luxury of an &quot;ideal&quot; dialytic prescription regarding potassium baths.</p><p>Any dialytic therapy that is associated with significant hypokalemia is associated with an increased hazard of digoxin-related tachyarrhythmias. In patients who are known to have large, unavoidable fluctuations in serum potassium levels, we would therefore recommend avoidance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, if possible.</p><p>Low-dialysate calcium concentration has also been associated with cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. In a case-control study, 510 patients who had a witnessed cardiac arrest were compared with 1560 matched control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Low-calcium dialysate (&lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> higher corrected serum calcium, and increasing serum dialysate calcium gradient were all associated with increased risk of cardiac arrest.</p><p>The most commonly used dialysate calcium concentration for chronic hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>We suspect that low-magnesium dialysate may also be important; low serum magnesium levels were associated with higher all-cause mortality in Japanese dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but few data exist on SCD risk and magnesium dialysate levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Nocturnal hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although unproven, long-duration, quotidian dialysis might reduce the risk of SCA in hemodialysis patients since it minimizes the large volume and electrolyte shifts that occur with conventional, thrice-weekly dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of specific medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues surrounding the use of specific medications in dialysis patients with heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increased risk of SCA are discussed below and in appropriate topic reviews. Some of these medications include beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a review of some of the data concerning the use and effect on SCA of medications including beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ARBs in dialysis patients. There are <strong>no</strong> compelling data to support the use of medications for prevention of SCA in dialysis patients without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is unclear whether beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the risk of SCA and SCD in dialysis patients without heart failure. One observational report from the US Subset of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) found that beta-adrenergic blockers are underutilized, with only 24 percent of dialysis patients with coronary artery disease or prior myocardial infarction (MI) receiving the therapy. However, hemodialysis patients treated with beta-adrenergic blockers had lower overall mortality, although cause-specific mortality was not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a subsequent analysis of DOPPS, beta blockers were associated with a lower risk of SCD among dialysis patients (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrospective studies have suggested a survival benefit from the use of ACE inhibitors in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As an example, one retrospective study of 60 hypertensive dialysis patients treated with ACE inhibitors and 60 patients not treated with such agents found a 52 percent risk reduction in all-cause mortality despite no significant difference in blood pressure reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Whether the favorable effects reported in these studies derived from a reduction in SCD is unknown. In contrast to these studies, one randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the ACE inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosinopril</a>, in dialysis patients with LV hypertrophy failed to show any benefit of active treatment in the occurrence of cardiovascular events, including cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARBs may provide protection against cardiovascular mortality, including SCD, among general dialysis patients. In one trial, 80 dialysis patients with no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or no therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There was a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and total mortality in the treatment group (zero and four sudden <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/severe</span> arrhythmias in the treatment and standard-therapy arms, respectively). Serum potassium levels were not significantly affected by active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, further studies are necessary before the use of ARBs in dialysis patients without heart failure can be recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SECONDARY PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate treatment of SCA consists of acute resuscitation. This is followed, in survivors, by attempted long-term prevention of recurrence by nonpharmacologic and, less often, pharmacologic therapies.</p><p>The type of medication being administered at the time of the event may impact survival post-SCA. This was shown in a retrospective study of 729 patients who sustained a cardiac arrest in a hemodialysis clinic, of whom 310 and 80 patients survived 24 hours and 6 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. After statistical adjustment, beta blocker therapy was significantly associated with survival at 24 hours (odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.86), while survival at six months was associated with beta blockers (OR 0.32, CI 0.17-0.61), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/angiotensin</span> II receptor blockers (ARBs; OR 0.51, CI 0.28-0.95), and calcium channel blockers (OR 0.42, CI 0.23-0.76).</p><p>Although intriguing, the interpretation of this study is difficult since the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) was not clearly incorporated in the analysis and the treatment of survivors was not adequately explained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, this study was limited by confounding by indication. This issue requires further study in large, prospective, randomized trials.</p><p>General issues surrounding secondary prevention are similar in patients with and without end-stage renal failure. This is discussed in detail separately.

As a result, resuscitated cardiac arrest is a class-I indication for placement of an ICD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Evidence for use of ICD therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Although there are no randomized, prospective studies that have examined the outcomes after ICD placement in dialysis patients who have survived SCA, limited retrospective evidence suggests that ICDs lower mortality in such dialysis patients.</p><p>We therefore recommend the use of ICDs for secondary prevention in dialysis patients. This is consistent with the 2006 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA)/European</span> Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines which state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p>&quot;Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients awaiting renal transplantation, should be treated conventionally, including the use of ICD and pacemaker as required, in patients who are receiving chronic optimal medical therapy and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than one year.&quot;</p><p>The benefits of an ICD for secondary prevention in this setting were best described in a retrospective cohort study that evaluated the outcomes of dialysis patients who survived ventricular fibrillation <span class=\"nowrap\">[VF]/cardiac</span> arrest and either received an ICD (460 patients) or did not receive an ICD (5582 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. ICD placement was associated with a significant reduction in risk of death (relative risk [RR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.50-0.66 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72475 \">figure 1</a>)).

A retrospective study suggested a more modest estimate of the survival benefit associated with ICDs among dialysis patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54540 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Although the cited study may be limited by the retrospective nature of the study design and by possible confounding by indication, these data support the use of ICDs in the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in dialysis patients.</p><p>Despite this possible survival benefit, ICDs are markedly underutilized in dialysis patients. As an example, the previously described study found that only 8 percent of dialysis patients with a history of resuscitated cardiac arrest received such a device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Cardiovascular Special Studies Center has also published data on ICD utilization, temporal trends, and estimated survival in dialysis patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69902 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60670 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the time period 1999 to 2008, 9573 US hemodialysis patients received an ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) device (5541 for secondary prevention and 4032 for primary prevention of SCD). The estimated one-year mortality overall was approximately 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73475 \">figure 5</a>). There was a progressive increase in utilization of ICDs for primary prevention of SCD over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75637\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75637 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Sudden cardiac arrest during hemodialysis session</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among nondialysis patients, it has been thought that patients with a life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the setting of a reversible arrhythmogenic disorder, such as ischemia or an electrolyte abnormality, have a low risk for recurrent SCA after correction of the underlying problem. Thus, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines state that ICD placement is not recommended for arrhythmia due to reversible causes. Similarly, earlier ICD guidelines from national organizations stated that &quot;transient or reversible disorders&quot; were a contraindication to device implantation. However, the 2006 ICD guidelines cautioned against attributing an arrest to reversible causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most such patients, with or without end-stage renal disease (ESRD), remain at high risk for SCD, even if coronary revascularization is performed and abnormalities are reversed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the CMS guidelines were clearly not designed for dialysis patients (although they are CMS beneficiaries), since their application to the setting of SCA occurring during dialysis is problematic. It is unclear, for example, how to accurately define a preventable, reversible cause among patients undergoing mandatory electrolyte shifts during a hemodialysis session. Although a simplistic approach would be to &quot;avoid large electrolyte shifts,&quot; this cannot be accomplished with conventional, thrice-weekly hemodialysis sessions. Even patients being dialyzed with a 3 mEq potassium dialysate bath will be exposed to rapid intradialytic potassium shifts.</p><p>The likelihood that a dialysis patient will be exposed to repeated electrolyte imbalances strongly suggests that these recommendations do <strong>not</strong> apply to this patient population. Thus, we recommend that dialysis patients resuscitated from SCA occurring during dialysis should be treated in exactly the same fashion as SCA occurring outside the hemodialysis center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Issues in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis patients present unique challenges to ICD placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased risk of bleeding and infection following cardiac rhythm management device implantation in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

It is unclear whether dialysis patients with similar clinical characteristics receive the same benefit in terms of primary prevention of SCD.

However, there are no prospective data on dialysis patients with cardiomyopathy. Patients were excluded from ICD trials if they were on dialysis or had no renal function data reported. In addition, dialysis patients, if included, have not been the subject of any subgroup analyses.

Although it is tempting to conclude that any high-risk population will benefit from ICD therapy, it is plausible that competing risks in the dialysis cohort may reduce the favorable impact of device implantation on survival. Only retrospective and observational studies have evaluated this question.
