Classic galactosemia, caused by complete deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), is the most common and severe type. The early signs and symptoms, such as liver dysfunction, susceptibility to infections, failure to thrive, and cataracts can be prevented or improved by early diagnosis and treatment, but patients can still have chronic and progressive neuropsychiatric impairments. Diagnosis requires measurement of enzyme activity in red blood cells.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of galactosemia caused by genetic defects are reviewed here. The management of galactosemia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=galactosemia-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Galactosemia: Management and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic galactosemia occurs in approximately 1 of 60,000 livebirths. However, the reported incidence of galactosemia varies geographically from 1 in 30,000 to 40,000 in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] to one in one million in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The estimated incidence in the United States is 1 in 53,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactose is a sugar found primarily in human and bovine milk and milk products as part of the disaccharide lactose. Lactose is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose by the intestinal enzyme lactase. The galactose then is converted to glucose for use as an energy source (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50614 \">figure 1</a>). Free galactose also is present in some fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, brussels sprouts, bananas, and apples. Altered metabolism of galactose caused by deficient enzyme activity or impaired liver function results in elevated blood galactose concentration and the condition known as galactosemia. Impaired galactose metabolism appears to alter gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, which may contribute to cognitive and other problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Galactosemia can result from deficiencies of three different enzymes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50614 \">figure 1</a>), each with a distinct phenotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency</strong> &ndash; The most common and severe form of galactosemia is caused by deficiency of GALT, the enzyme that converts galactose-1-phosphate (galactose-1-P) to uridine diphosphate galactose (UDPgalactose) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50614 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complete deficiency of GALT activity is known as classic galactosemia, often referred to by the isolated term, &quot;galactosemia.&quot; Untreated patients typically have failure to thrive, liver and renal dysfunction, and sepsis. Both treated and untreated patients may have cataracts, abnormal neurodevelopment, and premature ovarian failure. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these complications are unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Partial GALT activity occurs in numerous variants. The most common of these is the Duarte variant, in which patients have one Duarte allele and one classic allele <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/G),</span> resulting in GALT activity that is approximately 5 to 25 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with two Duarte alleles <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/D)</span> have approximately 25 percent normal GALT activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients with GALT activity &ge;50 percent of normal appear to have little to no evidence of neonatal or long-term morbidity if untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

The only consequence of GALK deficiency is the development of cataracts. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying this localized defect are unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose 4-epimerase (GALE) deficiency</strong> &ndash; UDP GALE converts UDPgalactose to UDPglucose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50614 \">figure 1</a>). In most patients with GALE (or epimerase) deficiency, the defect is localized to red blood cells (RBCs). The pathogenic mechanisms underlying this limited defect are unclear. These individuals typically have normal growth and development, whereas patients with generalized GALE deficiency in both RBCs and all other tissues present with symptoms similar to classic galactosemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactosemia is an autosomal-recessive disorder. More than 150 disease-causing mutations have been characterized for the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (<em>GALT</em>) gene, located on chromosome 9p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although a few are common. Fewer than 10 percent of mutations occur in multiple ethnic groups or geographic areas.</p><p>The most common alleles occurring in the North American population are the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77985\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77985 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Q188R &ndash; Glutamine to arginine missense mutation at amino acid position 188. It is the most common classic galactosemia allele in Caucasian and Hispanic Americans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>K285N &ndash; Lysine to asparagine missense mutation at amino acid position 285. It is a classic galactosemia allele that is a frequent occurrence in Eastern Europeans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S135L &ndash; Serine to leucine missense mutation at amino acid position 135. It is the most common allele in African Americans with classic galactosemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N314D &ndash; Asparagine to aspartate missense mutation at amino acid position 314 (Duarte variant allele). This allele is thought to be more prevalent in European populations than those of African or Asian ancestry, but actual detection rates vary significantly depending upon the screening approach used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Individuals with classic galactosemia have two classic alleles <span class=\"nowrap\">(G/G)</span>. Individuals with the Duarte variant are compound heterozygotes, with one Duarte allele and one classic allele <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/G)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phenotype does not appear to correlate with genotype in classic galactosemia, although data are conflicting. In one study, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were lower in children homoallelic for the Q188R mutation than in those heteroallelic for Q188R with other mutations (73.6 versus 94.8), independent of sociodemographic characteristics and metabolic control (galactose-1-P levels) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in other reports, deficits in cognitive function, neurologic signs, and ovarian failure did not correlate with genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Thus, mutation analysis is not useful for prognosis or therapy in an individual with classic galactosemia.</p><p>African Americans may have a milder form of galactosemia, probably because the S135L allele is more common in that population. However, the milder disease also may be caused by other epigenetic (not heritable) factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic galactosemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic galactosemia caused by complete deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) is the most common and severe type. Early diagnosis and treatment usually prevent or resolve the early signs and symptoms, such as liver dysfunction, susceptibility to infections, failure to thrive, and cataracts. However, despite dietary management, neuropsychiatric and ovarian problems occur in most adolescents and adults with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>All states in the United States and several other countries include galactosemia in their newborn screening (NBS) programs. However, affected infants may become symptomatic before the screening results become available (approximately 10 to 14 days after sample collection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, clinicians must consider the diagnosis in infants with the signs and symptoms noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2855222991\"><span class=\"h3\">Early manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with classic galactosemia usually present in the first few days after birth and initiation of feedings that contain galactose (eg, breast milk or cow's milk-based formula), often before the results of NBS are available. The use of galactose-limited or galactose-free formulas (such as the soy protein-based Enfamil ProSobee, which has demonstrated safety in infants with galactosemia) may mask the initial presentation.</p><p>Specific signs and symptoms occur with different frequencies.

They may have edema and ascites, a full fontanelle, encephalopathy, and excessive bruising or bleeding.</p><p>Cataracts may be present at birth but generally appear after two weeks as a result of galactitol deposition in the lens. In untreated classic galactosemia and galactokinase deficiency, typically there is initial clouding of the embryonic nucleus in the central lens followed by spreading to the cortex. Occasionally, children who are not caught early develop a nuclear cataract as they grow, similar to nucleus <em>pulverulentus</em> (derived from the Latin &quot;pulver&quot; = dust) where the nucleus of the lens looks like a cloud of dust.

The cataracts usually are bilateral and resolve with dietary therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A rare presentation of GALK deficiency is pseudotumor cerebri [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The mechanism is thought to be increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oncotic pressure resulting from elevated CSF galactitol concentration. Clinical features of classic galactosemia such as liver, kidney, and brain damages typically are not present in GALK deficiency. Hypergalactosemia is the only abnormal biochemical laboratory finding. There are no other laboratory findings of note for GALK deficiency on routine laboratory testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase (GALE) deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficiency of GALE is classically thought to be confined to erythrocytes. Affected individuals typically are asymptomatic, although erythrocyte levels of galactose-1-P are elevated. Generalized deficiency of this enzyme is rarely described.</p><p>In one report, five children from two families with generalized epimerase deficiency had dysmorphic facial features, sensorineural deafness, poor growth, and global developmental delay but not ovarian failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, another review of 10 patients found a spectrum of GALE activity ranging from 15 to 64 percent of control levels, suggesting that the metabolic defect is a continuum from mild (ie, red cell) to severe (ie, both red cells and lymphoblasts) impairment of galactose metabolism in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Quantitative assay of RBC GALT activity (using a fluoroimmunoassay or radioimmunoassay) is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Fluorometric assay of GALT enzyme activity'</a> below.)</p><p>Quantitative assay of RBC GALT activity may be affected for as long as three months by the transfusion of RBCs from a normal donor. In such cases, DNA testing for the Q188R mutation is helpful if the patient is homozygous but does not exclude classic galactosemia caused by other mutations. Other tests that may be helpful in transfused infants include measurement of GALT activity in the RBCs of both parents to determine whether they are carriers and measurement of RBC galactose-1-P in the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased RBC galactose-1-phosphate concentration is a characteristic finding of classic galactosemia.

In the majority of cases, enzyme analysis along with RBC galactose-1-phosphate and analysis of common mutations is sufficient to establish a diagnosis. Full gene sequencing alone (ie, without enzyme or other biochemical testing) may not be able to confirm a diagnosis, because of the large number of GALT mutations and difficulty in assessing pathogenicity of rare mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal counseling should be provided before conception to parents with a family history of galactosemia or a previously affected child.

In this test, elevated galactose levels inhibit bacterial growth around the filter paper blood spot after incubation in a special medium. False-negative results may occur in infants who fed poorly before the blood sample was obtained, were fed soy formula initially, or received antibiotics. If galactose levels are elevated, further testing should include an assay for GALT activity and electrophoretic mobility, and measurement of epimerase (GALE) and kinase (GALK) activity in RBCs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Other causes of elevated galactose are discussed above.

It is an autosomal-recessive disorder and occurs in approximately 1 in 60,000 livebirths. Infants with classic galactosemia usually present in the first few days after initiation of galactose-containing human breast milk or cow's milk-based feedings. Signs and symptoms include jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, diarrhea, and sepsis (particularly due to <em>Escherichia coli</em>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classic galactosemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative assay of red blood cell (RBC) GALT activity is necessary to confirm the diagnosis classic galactosemia.
