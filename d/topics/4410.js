Studies indicate that children involved with child welfare and living away from their parents in informal placements with relatives have had similar life experiences. Thus, providing health care for children involved with child welfare, and especially those in foster care, requires an understanding of childhood trauma and its potential negative impact on the developing brain; the unique health, mental health, developmental, and educational problems of children and adolescents in foster care; and the structure, goals, and mandates of the foster care system as this will facilitate provision of appropriate comprehensive care to this vulnerable population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Comprehensive health care for children and adolescents in foster care will be discussed here. The epidemiology of foster care and an overview of the foster care system in the United States are presented separately.

They are classified as children with special health care needs by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) because of the high prevalence of chronic medical, developmental, and mental health problems, most of which predate placement in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Most children in foster care have at least one chronic medical problem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57645 \">table 1</a>) and one-fourth have three or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/2,4,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6-10</a>].

Understanding the impact of multiple adverse childhood experiences is fundamental to providing appropriate care for these children. Their health problems are compounded by the trauma of removal and separation from their parents and the ongoing uncertainty of living in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/2,7,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,14-17</a>].</p><p>Children in foster care have often experienced multiple adversities by the time they enter foster care. Infants and young children entering foster care have high rates of prenatal substance exposure, prematurity, and chaotic and inappropriate caregiving by impaired parents and other care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Children entering foster care may have experienced significant levels of interpersonal violence in their families and communities and impaired caregiving in addition to the maltreatment in the form of abuse or neglect that resulted in removal and placement in foster care. Adolescents in foster care also have high rates of prior maltreatment, and rates may be higher among adolescents in congregate versus family foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Maltreatment is the ultimate breach of the parent-child relationship. Most young children in foster care have experienced ongoing or intermittent neglect of their most basic needs; they also may have been physically or sexually abused. Rigid, harsh discipline by a parent with unrealistic expectations is common in maltreating families, as is the absence of normal predictable nurturance and routines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The terms complex childhood trauma and toxic stress are used to describe the cumulative childhood adversities and subsequent chronic stimulation of the neuroendocrine stress system and inflammatory pathways that negatively affect brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/13,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20-24</a>] and overall health. The areas of the brain most affected are those involved in executive function, memory, emotional regulation, attention, and stress reactivity. The impact on cognitive and emotional development manifests as insecure attachment, intellectual disabilities, inattention, poor emotional self-regulation, impulsivity, hyperactivity, emotional reactivity, hyper-arousability, hypervigilance, and other behavioral and emotional problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/4,13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13,25</a>]. Ongoing exposure to early maltreatment in a setting lacking in protective factors can erode the resilience of children over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mental health issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mental health is the most significant health concern for children and adolescents in foster care. Behavioral and emotional problems rooted in childhood trauma and deprivation are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/1,10,25,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,25,27-31</a>]. Primary care providers should be vigilant in monitoring children and adolescents in foster care for past or current mental health problems. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mental health'</a> below.)</p><p>Children may present with symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention that mimic other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dysregulation of sleep, eating, and elimination are common and most often due to altered structure and function of specific areas of the brain. Thus, the provider needs to include trauma as part of their differential diagnosis of common childhood emotional and behavioral symptoms.</p><p>The frequency and severity of emotional problems related to complex childhood trauma may be compounded by the child's lack of security and permanence in foster care; lack of stability in placement exacerbates underlying emotional and behavioral problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. More than one-third of children in foster care have moderate to severe emotional problems, and another one-third have less severe disabilities.</p><p>Behavioral exacerbations may be precipitated by a number of factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visitation with birth parents, particularly if it is erratic or causes the child to relive the trauma of separation or rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stress of changes in placement, unrealistic expectations of <span class=\"nowrap\">foster/kinship</span> parents, and court appearances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in caseworkers, childcare providers, or therapists that magnify losses in the lives of these children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reminders of prior trauma, which may be subtle and escape the notice of the caregiver; a child or adolescent presenting with the symptoms noted below should be assessed for exposure to trauma reminders (see <a href=\"#H530937209\" class=\"local\">'Manifestations of mental health issues'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Most studies regarding the emotional health of children in foster care are flawed by small sample size and lack of standardized instruments, criteria for psychopathology, and norms for children in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, foster parent, social worker, or adolescent self-reports may underestimate emotional or developmental problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study of children entering foster care in California, for example, 84 percent were found to have emotional or developmental problems during comprehensive assessment, but only 33 percent of foster parents or social workers reported such problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a longitudinal national study, mental health access was low compared with mental health need but improved as children entered school or had more contact with health care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Disparities in mental health access remain a significant issue for children in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], with white children having more access than children of other <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicities</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Access to mental health is increased among young children (age two to five years) and those who have experienced sexual abuse (compared with neglect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, children in nonrelative foster care appear to have better access to mental health than those in relative foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. As young people &quot;age out&quot; of foster care, their access to mental health care also decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Children in foster care account for a disproportionate amount of Medicaid mental health expenditures and are more likely to use Medicaid-reimbursed mental health services and high-cost services (eg, emergency department, inpatient) than children eligible for Medicaid through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/25,28,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,41</a>]. Children in foster care also are more likely than those in TANF to have a mental health problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The mental health symptoms of children in foster care often are manifestations of trauma and can be difficult to distinguish from other problems such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The possibility that a child has experienced significant trauma that has not been identified or appropriately addressed should be considered in children with multiple mental health diagnoses.</p><p>Mental health issues related to early trauma also are prevalent among adolescents in foster care, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 17-year-olds entering foster care in Missouri, 61 percent had at least one psychiatric disorder during their lifetime; 62 percent reported that their earliest psychiatric problem was manifest before entering foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly one-third of older adolescents in foster care in the Midwest Study had affective or substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-five percent of young adults in the Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study had posttraumatic stress disorder (a rate nearly twice that in Vietnam war veterans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p>The AAP and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry strongly recommend that children entering foster care have a full mental health evaluation within several weeks of placement by a trauma-informed, pediatric mental health professional. The failure to view behavioral and emotional symptoms through a trauma lens may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Traumatic stress symptoms usually are treated with evidence-based psychotherapies, although medications may be prescribed in the short-term for the treatment of specific symptoms, such as insomnia. Caregivers may need to be counseled to use trauma-informed positive parenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and that medication is a temporary solution to assist with symptoms until the child can access trauma-informed mental health services. However, there are also children who have comorbid mental health diagnoses for which medication may be recommended. However, there is great concern about the patterns of psychotropic medication use among children and adolescents in foster care. Several studies have demonstrated several problems including a high prevalence of psychotropic medication use, polypharmacy, prescription of medication for a diagnosis for which the medication is not indicated, and use of two or more drugs from the same class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530937209\"><span class=\"h4\">Manifestations of mental health issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manifestation of emotional disorders related to trauma and toxic stress varies by intensity and frequency of <span class=\"nowrap\">stressors/trauma;</span> the age, temperament, and coping capacities of the child; and the presence or absence of protective factors in the child's life:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and young children frequently have sleeping and feeding disorders, extreme fussiness or irritability, and tremors related to withdrawal from prenatal substance exposures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preschool and early school-age children may have problems with toileting, emotional self-regulation, sleep, frequent tantrums, aggression, transitions, impulsivity, destructive behaviors, and hyperactivity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety is more common and depression is less common among children in foster care than expected. However, depression may be a later manifestation of early childhood trauma and manifest in adolescence.

Ideally, the investigating child protective worker or foster care caseworker has a standardized health history form completed by the birth parent. Otherwise, the medical home provider with appropriate authorization or foster care caseworker may need to seek health information from previous sources of care (if known), schools, childcare settings, immunization registries, and newborn screening programs.</p><p>Although some have advocated for a medical passport (a portable health record that travels with the child or a web-based or electronic passport), a standardized, universally accepted health passport has not been developed. A few states have a centralized health information system into which health information is entered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. While the child is in foster care, it is helpful to collect and maintain up-to-date immunization records, the medical problem list, medication list, and pertinent psychosocial information. Such information should follow the child through placement changes or changes in providers. Ideally, the medical home remains constant even if a placement change occurs, so that the medical home serves as the central repository of health information while the child is in foster care. Laws and regulations around information sharing vary among states so that it is best to seek direction from the state child welfare system or health attorney regarding who <span class=\"nowrap\">can/should</span> have access to health information, including via the patient portal of electronic health records.

Other difficulties in the provision of quality health care for children in foster care include the [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of an organized system of health care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of adequate health care coverage for all their health needs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of a documented health history provided by the biological parents or caregiver at entry to foster care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High mobility of the child among foster care placements and into and out of foster care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High turnover rates of case workers and other professionals in the system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of health provider knowledge about the impact of trauma on children and its treatment</p><p/><p>State Medicaid systems rarely adequately reimburse for all the services that these children require, especially mental health services. In general, Medicaid may not pay for services that have been shown to be of benefit to highly traumatized children, such as therapeutic foster care, mentored visitation, and evidence-based mental health services such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Some communities have addressed these problems by enrolling Medicaid-eligible children and adolescents in foster care into prepaid capitated health plans (Medicaid managed care) to provide an immediate, organized system for comprehensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. However, mental health care has not always been adequately addressed or covered by managed care. Other communities have provided a centralized source of comprehensive care or identified preferred providers who are willing and able to provide the scope of required services by cobbling together a variety of funding streams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Many such programs ensure quality health services but operate at a substantial deficit. Some states mandate immediate enrollment of children in foster care into Medicaid Managed Care (MMC). Ideally, states would negotiate with MMC to define a package of benefits that would promote integrated care models, preventive mental health services, and appropriate coverage for children with complex medical, mental health, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental health problems. As of January 1, 2014, any young adult emancipating from foster care at age 18 years or older can retain their Medicaid coverage until age 26 years. Federal law requires that Medicaid coverage be available to the young adult graduate of foster care who moves out of state.</p><p>The diffusion of authority and responsibility for the health care of children and adolescents in foster care results in a number of complexities. Child welfare is ultimately responsible for the health care of children and teens in foster care, but parents retain legal guardianship and consent rights until the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/teen</span> is freed for adoption. Thus, foster caregivers and relatives have physical custody but do not have the right to consent for health care in most states. Laws around who may consent for human immunodeficiency virus screening and have access to screening results also vary from state to state. Adolescents in foster care who have capacity to consent are covered by laws governing minors in their state. Caseworkers often have limited health information available to them at the time of removal and placement. In addition, they may have insufficient knowledge or training to know what types of information should be collected, or how to access needed health care services. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children and adolescents in foster care may have had fragmented or sparse access to health services before placement. Foster parents are typically provided with little past health history and may need to choose the child's health care provider with little guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].</p><p>Delays in referrals are common as professionals may wait to see whether the child will remain in foster care before making the referral. Many young children do not receive adequate preventive health care while in placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial screening ideally should occur within 72 hours of removal from the birth parent and placement in a foster or kinship home, shelter, or group setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/63,64,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64,74</a>].

It is important to see the child or adolescent privately for at least a few minutes to ensure that the child feels supported and cared for in their placement, and to perform health risk behavior screening (particularly for adolescents). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Health needs'</a> above.)</p><p>Anticipatory guidance, particularly related to chronic illness and behavioral concerns, may help to avoid unnecessary visits to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/32,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,77</a>].

In addition to the usual components of health history, information for a child in foster care should include information about the child's reason(s) for placement, trauma history, legal status, and the names and roles of the child welfare workers who are responsible for the child (eg, foster parents, caseworker, law guardian). Information should be gathered from as many sources as possible (previous health care providers, caseworkers, foster parents, natural parents, other relatives, schools, childcare centers, etc) to obtain medical, family, social, behavioral, and educational histories that are as complete as possible. Information is often not available at entry to care and often takes weeks to months to obtain.</p><p>Child welfare is ultimately responsible for obtaining and sharing health information since the child is in their care and custody. However, clinicians may be able to assist by providing a form for the caseworker to fill out or assisting with information gathering. Details of the child's current foster care history and any past foster care history are important since clinicians are often the gatekeepers to other needed care and often find themselves in the role of interpreting information for caregivers and children. Thus, the following information is helpful for health providers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age and circumstances under which the child entered the foster care system, including the psychosocial history (maltreatment history, family composition, family disruption, domestic violence exposure, family mental health history, family involvement with criminal justice, etc)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of placements and the <span class=\"nowrap\">circumstances/reasons</span> for the placement changes, some of which may have occurred prior to foster care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's feelings about being in foster care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency and nature of contact or visitation with biologic parents and siblings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The composition of the foster family (adults in the home; children in the home whether birth, adopted, or in foster care)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How other children in foster care fared in this foster family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The foster parents' attitudes and beliefs regarding discipline</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How the foster parent approaches integrating children in foster care into their family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The requirements of any potential reunification plan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current permanency plan goal(s) (ie, reunification, placement with a <span class=\"nowrap\">relative/kinship</span> caregiver, adoption, emancipation, placement change)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the child is free for adoption or adoption is in process</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children placed in foster care should have a comprehensive physical examination that remains sensitive to their prior trauma history to assess their health status. Particular attention should be paid to growth parameters, skin findings, vision, hearing, dental, musculoskeletal, and neurologic health. Young children should be screened for developmental problems. Adolescents should be assessed for sexual maturation and fitness for sports participation.

Additional considerations include the child's level of comfort, cooperation, and willingness to engage in the examination. Although every part of the child's skin should be viewed during the course of the examination, the examination does not require fully undressing the child, which may be traumatic. Whenever possible when there is suspected sexual abuse, genital examination should be performed by a trained forensic clinician.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth &ndash; Assessment of growth is an important component of the physical examination for children in foster care.

Developmental screening may help the provider to determine which children do not need further assessment versus those who require monitoring or referral. The accuracy of information depends upon how familiar the foster caregiver is with the child. Screening with a validated instrument may increase the detection of developmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H2651325861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Approach to screening'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Referral for a full developmental evaluation is preferred to screening for this high risk population, but screening is reasonable in communities lacking the resources to conduct full evaluations for every child in foster care. For children age 0 to 3 years in the United States, Early Intervention (EI) is the appropriate evaluation resource; children with documented child neglect or abuse are automatically eligible for an EI evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. For preschool-aged children, school districts have the responsibility to conduct an educational assessment and develop an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 plan for children with identified needs who meet eligibility criteria. Referral is not necessary for those children who already have an IEP or 504 plan, but providers may want to obtain a copy and monitor its implementation.

Child welfare is mandated by law to maintain children in their school of origin whenever possible, even if they have to provide transportation to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. However, extraordinary travel requirements may qualify as a compelling reason for a child to change schools upon entry to foster care. Communication between the foster parents, school personnel, the caseworker, and the clinician are essential to the identification and amelioration of school issues. School personnel may need help in understanding the child's behavioral issues in the context of his or her history of trauma and loss. The comprehensive evaluation and management of children with developmental and educational disorders requires an organized system of follow-up and consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Many children in foster care have symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, and the pediatric provider may receive requests for pharmacologic treatment of presumed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, in a child with a history of trauma, ADHD symptoms require a full mental health assessment before considering initiation pharmacologic treatment of ADHD.

Adolescents may be at risk for these infections because of unsafe sexual practices, tattoos, body piercing, or needle-sharing. </p><p>The guidelines for testing children and adolescents in foster care for these conditions vary from state to state. However, we suggest that children and adolescents entering foster care be tested for hepatitis C, syphilis, and HIV. We screen children for hepatitis B if they do not have documentation of complete immunization. Tuberculosis screening may be warranted for children with increased risk, including exposure to an infected individual or an individual at high risk whose status is unknown.

Urine pregnancy screening is also recommended for all adolescent females in foster care beginning at age 11 to 12 years. In an observational study of children entering foster care from one county, 7 percent of adolescents tested positive for <em>Chlamydia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>Pediatric providers should become familiar with the particular emancipated minor laws and regulations governing HIV risk assessment, screening, and information sharing for the foster care population in their state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. As a general rule, birth parents retain the right to consent for HIV testing unless the child is eligible for adoption or parental rights have been terminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Most come from countries in which parasitic, bacterial, or viral infections are common, so the initial screening should include: hepatitis B and C, rapid plasma reagin, HIV, complete blood count (CBC), and screening for tuberculosis. If the CBC has a higher than usual percentage of eosinophils or absolute eosinophil count, screening for parasitic diseases endemic to the country of origin is recommended. A negative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> does not exclude tuberculosis infection in a malnourished individual, so repeat testing in several months <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a chest radiograph is recommended.

As of January 1, 2014, youth who age out of foster care can retain their Medicaid coverage until age 26 years.</p><p/><p>In addition, pediatric health care providers may wish to participate in aspects of foster care at the community level. They may help to identify and recruit foster parents, participate in continuing education programs for the staff of child welfare agencies or foster parents, share in the development of policies and procedures for health care for children in foster care, or become a member of a citizens' review board that monitors the planning of agencies on behalf of the children in their care. Pediatric health providers may also wish to work at the state level through their local AAP chapter. Since 2008, states have been required to engage pediatricians in the development of health care oversight systems for children in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comprehensive-health-care-for-children-in-foster-care/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children in foster care are a uniquely vulnerable population, with an increased prevalence of chronic medical, developmental, and mental health problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57645 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex childhood trauma underlies many of the health problems affecting children and adolescents in foster care. Their health problems may be compounded by the trauma of removal and separation from their parents and the ongoing uncertainty of living in foster care. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Complex childhood trauma and toxic stress'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care for children and adolescents in the foster care system includes information gathering, an admission health series consisting of at least three visits, developmental or educational evaluation, mental health evaluation, and a proactive <span class=\"nowrap\">preventive/monitoring</span> health care schedule. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Health care provision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial health screening should occur within 72 hours of removal from the birth parent. The objectives of this encounter are: assessment for abuse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neglect, contagious diseases, acute mental health issues, and acute or chronic health needs requiring immediate attention. In addition, this is an opportunity to provide guidance regarding the empathetic management of behaviors related to prior trauma. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Initial screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The comprehensive health assessment should occur within one month of placement. The goals of the comprehensive assessment are to identify and formulate a management plan for each health problem and ensure that the plan is communicated to the child welfare caseworker and foster parent. Referral for mental health, developmental, educational, and dental assessments should be made if not already in process. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Comprehensive health assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The follow-up visit should occur 30 to 60 days after the comprehensive assessment. The follow-up visit provides an opportunity to review newly obtained health history, including the results of the mental health and developmental (or educational) evaluations, assess adjustment to foster care and visitation, monitor for abuse and neglect, and provide support and guidance to the foster parent and child. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up visit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children in foster care should receive preventive health services according to the American Academy of Pediatrics' schedule for children in foster care. Additional monitoring visits are suggested according to the following schedule: monthly until age six months; every three months from age 6 to 24 months; and every six months from 24 months to 21 years. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Recommended health surveillance schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric practices providing medical care for children in foster care should be trauma-informed and organized to accommodate the special needs of these children.
