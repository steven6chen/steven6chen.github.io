This topic will review Tourette syndrome. Other hyperkinetic movement disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TS is thought to result from a complex interaction between social and environmental factors and multiple genetic abnormalities. In most cases a bilineal transmission (inheritance from both parents) is clearly evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Despite a large number of genetic studies, no single or even multiple causative genes for TS have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The disorder likely results from a disturbance in the striatal-thalamic-cortical (mesolimbic) spinal system, which leads to disinhibition of the motor and limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although the genetic basis remains elusive, several loci have been identified as candidate susceptibility regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The discovery of a mutation in the SLITRK1 gene on chromosome 13q31.1 was a major advance in the search for the elusive TS gene or genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The SLITRK1 gene is expressed in brain regions previously implicated in TS (cortex, hippocampus, thalamic, subthalamic and globus pallidus nuclei, striatum, and cerebellum) and it appears to play a role in dendritic growth. However, it is not clear how the altered gene product leads to the complex neurobehavioral disorder. This mutation appears to be a rare cause of TS as it has not been found in hundreds of TS patients tested.</p><p>Another possible rare genetic cause of TS is a mutation in the HDC gene on chromosome 15q21-q22, as detected in two generations of a family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The HDC gene encodes for L-histidine decarboxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of histamine from histidine. In the central nervous system, histaminergic neurons are located in the posterior hypothalamus but have widespread axonal connections to other brain regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These findings suggest the possibility of using pharmacologic manipulation of histaminergic neurotransmission to treat TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, it is unknown how histamine abnormalities might cause or contribute to TS symptoms.</p><p>Neuropathologic examinations have detected no consistent brain abnormalities in patients with TS, but a number of neuroimaging studies have found evidence of structural or metabolic changes in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study using volumetric MRI found that gray matter volumes in the left frontal lobes were smaller in patients with TS than in controls, supporting the loss of the normal left &gt; right asymmetry in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that used 3-Tesla MRI to evaluate 52 adult patients with TS and 52 matched controls, patients with TS had reduced depth and thickness of gray matter in the pre- and post-central, as well as superior, inferior, and internal frontal sulci, suggestive of abnormal brain development in TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of anatomic imaging studies found that caudate volumes were reduced in children and adults with TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, tic severity in children with TS correlated with sensorimotor cortex volume reduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has shown variable rates of glucose utilization in basal ganglia as compared with controls. One study, utilizing [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans, identified a TS-related pattern characterized by increased premotor cortex and cerebellum activity and reduced resting activity of the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>Although it has been proposed that antibodies to basal ganglia neurons from Group A streptococcal infection may contribute to pathogenesis of TS in some patients, there is little or no evidence that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) plays a role in the development of TS. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis&quot;, section on 'PANDAS syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717219457\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a meta-analysis of 21 population-based studies that specifically assessed TS in children, the pooled prevalence of TS was 0.52 percent (95% CI 0.32-0.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other studies have found that TS affects males more often than females by a ratio of approximately 4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Most but not all reports suggest that the prevalence of TS is similar among different ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], with the exception that TS appears to be uncommon or rare among African Americans and sub-Saharan black Africans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Prenatal maternal smoking may be associated with an increased risk for TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tics are the clinical hallmark of TS. The onset of TS is typically is between 2 and 15 years, although the diagnosis may be delayed until 21 years in some cases. The average age at onset is approximately 6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>], and the disorder is manifested by age 11 years in 96 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most patients with TS also have comorbid problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).</p><p>As discussed below, TS often improves in adulthood (see <a href=\"#H1717219450\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). Nonetheless, the most common cause of &quot;adult-onset&quot; tics is TS that remits after puberty and reappears as tics later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other causes of tics seen in adults are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tics are sudden, brief, intermittent movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal or phonic tics). Tics have been considered involuntary, but tics can temporarily be voluntarily suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>].</p><p>The tics in TS can be categorized as either simple or complex. Simple tics include eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head jerking. Many patients have complex sequences of coordinated movements, including bizarre gait, kicking, jumping, body gyrations, scratching, and seductive or obscene gestures. Certain characteristics of the tics, including the waxing and waning nature, the irresistible urge before and relief after a tic, and the temporary suppressibility may result in the mistaken diagnosis of a psychogenic disorder. One of the most characteristic features of tics is the presence of premonitory feelings or sensations, which are relieved by the execution of the tic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Involuntary vocalizations, ranging from simple noises to coprolalia (obscene words), echolalia (repetition of words), and palilalia (repetition of a phrase or word with increasing rapidity), frequently occur. Coprolalia occurs in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many patients also experience copropraxia (obscene gestures), echopraxia (mimicking of gestures), bizarre thoughts and ideas, thought fixation, compulsive ruminations, and perverse sexual fantasies.</p><p>Violent or forceful neck tics in patients with TS rarely have been associated with injuries including cervical disc herniation, compressive and noncompressive myelopathy, and cervical artery dissection with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Thus, some experts advocate more aggressive management of severe forceful neck tics, including the use of botulinum toxin injections or even deep brain stimulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comorbidity in TS is frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a large international registry of 3500 patients with TS, comorbid conditions included ADHD (60 percent), OCD (27 percent), obsessive-compulsive behavior (32 percent), learning disorder (23 percent), and conduct <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/oppositional</span> defiant disorder (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to have behavioral problems such as sleep difficulties, coprolalia, self-injurious behavior, and anger control problems. Motor and vocal manifestations were more frequent in boys, whereas girls were more likely to have behavioral problems such as OCD. Only 12 percent of patients with TS had no comorbid conditions.</p><p>The association of behavior disorders with tics in a community-based study was similar to clinic-based reports. In a study of school children aged 9 to 17 years, OCD, ADHD, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders were significantly more common in children with than without tics and with than without TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-half of the author's patients have sleep complaints, including restlessness, insomnia, enuresis, somnambulism, nightmares, and bruxism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Motor tics were recorded during sleep by polysomnography in approximately two-thirds. Several additional reports have found an association between TS and sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Other studies suggest that adults and children with TS have an increased prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neurologic examination in patients with TS is often normal except for the presence of tics. However, some patients have increased rates of normal blinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], subtle oculomotor disturbances related to saccadic eye movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], or other evidence of mild impairment of motor control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard anatomical neuroimaging studies such as routine head CT and brain MRI are unremarkable in patients with TS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, volumetric MRI studies have found evidence of structural changes in the brain. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that caudate nucleus volume loss may be a disease marker of TS. A study using high resolution MRI found that the average volume of caudate nucleus was reduced in patients with TS by five to eight percent compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, a prospective longitudinal study of 43 children with TS found that childhood caudate volume on MRI was inversely associated with the severity of both tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in late adolescence and early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TS is based on the clinical features of the disease, particularly the presence of multiple motor and vocal tics, with onset before age 18 or 21, depending upon which criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The presence of vocal tics such as grunting is required for the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis is often supported by the presence of coexisting behavioral disorders (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above) including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A family history of similar symptoms also supports the diagnosis of TS.</p><p>As noted above, the mistaken diagnosis of a psychogenic disorder may occur because of certain characteristics of the tics in patients with TS, including the waxing and waning nature, the irresistible urge before and relief after a tic, exacerbation during periods of stress and reduction during mental concentration, and the temporary suppressibility. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Tics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no confirmatory laboratory test for TS; the diagnosis is based on a set of clinical diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. The Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group criteria for a definite diagnosis of TS are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both multiple motor tics and one or more phonic tics must be present at some time during the illness, although not necessarily concurrently</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tics must occur many times a day, nearly every day, or intermittently throughout a period of more than one year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomical location, number, frequency, type, complexity, or severity of tics must change over time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of tics before the age of 21 years (the DSM-5 criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] require onset of tics before age 18 years)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involuntary movements and noises must not be explained by another medical condition (or by the physiological effects of substances as per the DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor tics, phonic tics, or both must be witnessed by a reliable examiner at some point during the illness or be recorded by videotape or cinematography</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717219464\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although TS is the most common cause of persistent or recurrent tics, there are many potential etiologies in the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The main entity in the differential diagnosis of TS is transient tics of childhood, which occur in approximately 25 percent of normal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other considerations in the differential include neuroacanthocytosis, drugs such as dopamine receptor blocking agents and cocaine, pervasive developmental disorders, and insults to the basal ganglia resulting from head trauma or stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61505 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The ability to temporarily suppress tics and the premonitory sensations that often precede tics are features of TS that help to differentiate it from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, athetosis, myoclonus, and paroxysmal dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/1,2,27,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,27,49,50</a>].

Specific treatment of TS is guided by the need to treat the most troublesome symptoms, including both tics and comorbid conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), behavioral problems, and mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Many patients require a combination of therapy to treat tics, ADHD, and OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Some clinicians, particularly psychiatrists, recommend behavioral therapy, primarily based on habit reversal therapy (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Habit reversal training'</a> below), as the first step in the management of tics and other features of TS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1797286614\"><span class=\"h2\">Tics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with TS who have tics that are mild and nondisabling, we suggest education and counseling without pharmacologic tic suppression therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. For patients with TS and bothersome tics, we suggest treatment with medications including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>. For patients with TS who have only focal motor or phonic tics, we suggest treatment with botulinum toxin injections into the affected muscles. Where available, we suggest behavioral therapy with habit reversal training for patients with TS and bothersome tics who either prefer nonpharmacologic treatment or who have not tolerated or responded to pharmacologic interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Antidopaminergic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While in the past we have used drugs that block dopamine receptors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a> (starting at 1 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> (starting at 1 to 4 mg daily), we have gradually shifted to dopamine depleter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> (starting at 12.5 mg daily) as the initial drug of choice for patients with troublesome tics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. These drugs appear to have a similar response rate, reducing the frequency and intensity of tics by approximately 60 to 80 percent. In our experience, these drugs are more effective and better tolerated than neuroleptics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">haloperidol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pimozide</a>, which are among the few drugs approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of TS. Tetrabenazine, which depletes dopamine by inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), is particularly useful because it is as effective as the typical neuroleptics, but it does not cause tardive dyskinesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1797287490\"><span class=\"h3\">Alpha adrenergic agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alpha adrenergic agonists <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-61</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">guanfacine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>] may be useful for suppressing tics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], but the evidence for tic reduction with these agents is not consistent. In some trials, alpha adrenergic agonists were no better than placebo for reducing tics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/58,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,63,64</a>], and indirect evidence suggests that the magnitude of effect may be less than that of the dopamine antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, guanfacine and clonidine are effective for treating the symptoms of ADHD, and may be helpful in patients with TS who have ADHD or predominant behavioral symptoms, particularly impulse control problems and rage attacks.

In a single randomized controlled clinical trial of 18 patients with simple motor tics, botulinum toxin treatment resulted in a significantly decline in the number of tics per minute within two weeks of injection compared with placebo (39 percent reduction versus 6 percent increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Outcome evaluators were blind to treatment allocation. After 10 weeks of treatment, the group assigned to behavioral therapy had a significantly greater reduction on the total tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale compared with the control group (-7.6 versus -3.5, group difference 4.1, 95% CI 2.0-6.2). The group difference of 4.1 was considered clinically meaningful. In addition, the behavioral therapy group had a significantly greater improvement on a global measure of overall treatment response.</p><p>Where available, we suggest behavioral therapy with HRT for patients with TS and bothersome tics who either prefer nonpharmacologic treatment or who have not tolerated or responded to pharmacologic interventions. However, several limitations apply. The success of this behavioral management is critically dependent on active involvement of the parents and the therapist, both of whom must be well trained and skilled in the various HRT techniques. Given the demands on time and effort on the part of the patient, the therapist, and parents, it is unlikely that all parties will be able to maintain the needed compliance with the training program to provide sustained benefit. There is also some concern as to whether the mental effort required to fully comply with the various components of HRT could actually interfere with patient's attention and learning.</p><p>While there has been a great deal of effort exerted over the last several decades making the scientific, clinical, and lay community understand the biological basis of TS, the reported response to behavioral therapy may be misinterpreted by some as evidence that tics and TS are of psychological etiology. This is one reason why behavioral therapies are often not covered by insurance or other third party payers. Thus, only a limited number of patients will be able to access this behavioral therapy as compared with pharmacologic treatment, which actually may be more effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1797287605\"><span class=\"h3\">Deep brain stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with TS who have disabling tics that are refractory to optimal medical management may be candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of globus pallidus, thalamus, or other subcortical targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tourette-syndrome/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].
