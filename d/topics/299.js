Acute MR has also been reported in the setting of dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction, particularly in patients with stress cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].

This is in contrast to chronic MR where these adaptations have time to develop and typically preserve hemodynamic stability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The degree of hemodynamic deterioration in acute MR depends upon the etiology and degree of MR, which is often dramatic and rapid in onset. An important factor is left atrial compliance, which is usually normal unless the acute regurgitation is superimposed upon chronic MR. Since the normal left atrium is not compliant, the sudden and marked increase in left atrial volume in acute MR results in an abrupt elevation in pressure within the left atrium. This is immediately reflected back into the pulmonary circulation, often leading to pulmonary edema.</p><p>In addition, because the left ventricle is not dilated and a large fraction of the blood ejected by the ventricle goes backward across the mitral valve, effective forward flow is limited. Despite a compensatory increase in heart rate, forward cardiac output falls, which can precipitate cardiogenic shock. The neurohumoral response to the reduction in cardiac output is an increase in vascular resistance, which exacerbates the regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamics-of-valvular-disorders-as-measured-by-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the degree of regurgitation is limited and left atrial compliance increases, the pressures within the left atrium and pulmonary circulation fall and hemodynamics improve. However, this does not occur in most cases because the amount of regurgitation is large and the left atrium does not accommodate well. Thus, urgent surgical intervention to repair or replace the valve is usually essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute MR usually presents as a cardiac emergency with the sudden onset and rapid progression of pulmonary edema, hypotension, and signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock. In some cases, the pulmonary hypertension leads to acute right-sided heart failure. In clinical practice, acute MR may not be recognized at presentation because the clinical history mimics an acute pulmonary process (such as infection or acute respiratory distress syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and the physical examination findings often are subtle. Physicians should include acute valve regurgitation in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with pulmonary decompensation and consider echocardiography early in the disease course to exclude or confirm this possibility. </p><p>The presentation may not be as dramatic if acute MR is superimposed upon chronic MR or the patient is younger and physically fit. Such patients may present subacutely in the office or clinic, rather than in the Emergency Department. They may note increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and weakness with little or no overt heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with acute MR is often in pulmonary edema and there is evidence of poor tissue perfusion with peripheral vasoconstriction, pallor, and diaphoresis. The arterial pulse is often rapid and of low amplitude or thready due to the reduction in forward stroke volume. When there is an associated increase in right-sided pressure, the neck veins become distended; they may also become pulsatile with a marked &quot;v&quot; wave if the elevated right ventricular pressure leads to tricuspid regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cardiac apical impulse is hyperdynamic but is usually normal in location because left ventricular size is normal. If, however, acute regurgitation is superimposed upon chronic MR, the cardiac impulse may be displaced due to the underlying left ventricular enlargement. There may be a hyperdynamic precordium with a right ventricular lift due to the acute increase in pressure within this chamber and the development of tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur of acute MR may be early systolic, midsystolic, or holosystolic. However, since the pressure within the left atrium markedly increases during ventricular systole and the pressure gradient between the left atrium and ventricle diminishes or disappears by the end of systole, the systolic murmur is often soft, low-pitched, and decrescendo, often ending well before A2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When present, the murmur is often best heard along the left sternal border and base of the heart, generally without a thrill, and may radiate to the back. It can be confused with an acute ventricular septal defect which, like acute MR, is a complication of an acute myocardial infarction.</p><p>An S3 filling sound is commonly heard but may be difficult to appreciate if tachycardia is present. With the development of pulmonary hypertension, P2 is increased in intensity and the murmurs of pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation may be appreciated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Silent MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients with moderate to severe acute ischemic MR have no audible murmur, particularly those with acute ischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. As an example, a community-based series of 773 patients who underwent echocardiography within 30 days of a myocardial infarction found that 89 had moderate to severe MR; 28 of these patients (31 percent) had no murmur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The presumed mechanism of silent MR is a relatively low systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and left atrium due to the combination of a low systemic blood pressure and elevated left atrial pressure. In addition, acoustic transmission of the murmur may be obscured by obesity and respiratory distress. Thus, the absence of a systolic murmur does not reliably exclude the diagnosis of acute severe MR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing in patients with acute MR consists of an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, echocardiography, and, in some patients, coronary angiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are generally no electrocardiographic abnormalities specifically associated with acute MR. There may, however, be changes that reflect the etiology, such as an acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, or P-mitrale reflecting underlying chronic MR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph usually shows a normal size cardiac silhouette and signs of pulmonary edema. Signs of interstitial and alveolar edema are most commonly symmetric. Occasionally (9 percent in one study), the pulmonary edema is unilateral, typically limited to the right upper lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The echocardiogram, including Doppler studies, should establish the diagnosis, mechanism, and etiology of acute MR.

With papillary muscle rupture, the ruptured head is seen in the left ventricle and usually prolapses back into the left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73295\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73295 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77752\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77752 \">movie 2</a>). Chordal rupture with rheumatic disease more often affects the anterior leaflet, while chordal rupture with myxomatous disease more often involves the posterior leaflet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vegetations on the leaflets may be seen in patients with endocarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of regurgitation is evaluated with Doppler studies.

Thus, when transthoracic echocardiography is nondiagnostic in patients with suspected acute native valve MR (eg, acute heart failure with a hyperdynamic left ventricle), transesophageal echocardiography provides improved images of the mitral valve and assessment of regurgitant severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For prosthetic mitral valves, transesophageal imaging is almost always necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acute severe MR have hemodynamic compromise and exercise testing is not appropriate. However, in patients with ischemic MR, regurgitation that is not severe at rest may become severe with exercise. Detecting significant MR under these circumstances may require exercise echocardiography.</p><p>The mechanism of worsening MR with exercise may be papillary muscle displacement (previously known as papillary muscle dysfunction) or alterations in papillary muscle orientation due to hypokinesis of the underlying left ventricular wall. However, worsening of MR with exercise can occur in the absence of detectable ischemia, as evidenced by the absence of chest pain or typical electrocardiographic or echocardiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Such patients can present with acute pulmonary edema and have a worse prognosis. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Although data supporting efficacy are limited, these lesions are usually revascularized at the time of mitral valve surgery since concurrent bypass surgery typically adds little morbidity or mortality to the procedure.

In most cases, the definitive treatment is prompt surgical intervention. However, medical therapy may be needed to support the patient while the diagnosis is made and in the interval until surgery can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of medical therapy in acute MR is to stabilize the patient in preparation for surgery. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> can reduce MR, by reducing systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The decrease in MR severity increases forward cardiac output and diminishes pulmonary congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Vasodilator use is often limited by systemic hypotension.</p><p>Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation has been used as a temporizing measure prior to emergency valve surgery in patients with acute MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Temporary stabilization may also be achieved using a short-term circulatory assist device (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a>). From a physiologic point of view, a percutaneous transaortic left ventricular assist device (such as an Impella device) should improve forward cardiac output in patients with acute MR and there have been case reports suggesting this approach may provide clinical benefit in supporting hemodynamics until surgical correction of MR can be performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact timing and risk of surgical intervention depend upon whether MR is nonischemic (chordal rupture). Older studies showed a very high risk of surgery for patients with acute MR, with mortality rates as high as 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. In a later multicenter study of surgery for acute severe MR in 279 patients, overall 30-day mortality was 23 percent, but 15-year survival was 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. All 279 patients were hemodynamically unstable before surgery. Valve repair was performed in 27 percent, with valve replacement in the remainder. The cause of regurgitation was ischemic in 45 percent, myxomatous mitral valve disease in 26 percent, and endocarditis in 28 percent. Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were acute myocardial infarction, acute endocarditis, shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and coronary disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Chordal rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prompt mitral valve surgery is recommended for symptomatic acute severe nonischemic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33</a>].</p><p>Acute MR caused by chordal rupture often can be treated early with mitral valve repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Compared with valve replacement, mitral valve repair is associated with a lower operative mortality, preservation of left ventricular function, and better long-term survival. In addition, the risks of a prosthetic valve and anticoagulation are avoided. </p><p>Management of patients with flail leaflet with chronic MR is discussed separately.

Elective surgery is appropriate for acute severe regurgitation due to endocarditis, even in the absence of heart failure. In a propensity-matched study of early versus late surgery for endocarditis, the absolute risk reduction in mortality with surgery was 5.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Risk factors for worse outcomes after surgery include older age, female gender, and poor left ventricular systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In some patients, the risk of surgical intervention may be so high as to be futile.</p><p>In a study of 54 patients undergoing surgery for papillary muscle rupture between 1980 and 2000, 10-year survival was only 35 percent and 10-year survival free of heart failure was only 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These patients had a mean age of 70&plusmn;8 years, were predominantly male (74 percent) and 91 percent presented with cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, or cardiac arrest. Operative mortality (overall 18.9 percent) was high but decreased over time with an operative mortality of 8.7 percent in patients operated after 1990 with coronary artery bypass grafting. </p><p>With the use of echocardiography, partial papillary muscle rupture can be recognized. The prognosis in such patients depends upon the extent of myocardial damage and severity of MR. With partial papillary muscle rupture, some surgeons prefer to stabilize the patient and delay surgery for six to eight weeks after myocardial infarction to avoid operating on the necrotic myocardial tissue. However, many patients cannot be stabilized and acute intervention must be considered. </p><p>The outcomes after surgery for papillary muscle rupture were illustrated in a report of 55 patients with acute ischemic MR who underwent urgent surgery: 25 had complete papillary muscle rupture; 12 had partial papillary muscle rupture; and 18 papillary muscle dysfunction (or papillary muscle displacement) without rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The valve could be repaired in only four patients, with the remaining patients requiring mitral valve replacement. The overall operative mortality was 24 percent with a higher mortality in those who did not undergo coronary revascularization compared with those who did (34 versus 9 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590349\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcatheter mitral valve repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcatheter mitral valve repair has been described in a limited number of patients with ischemic MR in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. One report described treatment of five patients who had high surgical risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The mitral valve clip was successfully placed in all five patients with a reduction in MR severity and pulmonary pressures. One patient died of multiorgan failure within one week of the procedure. The other four patients were alive after one year. However, evidence for the benefit of this approach over surgical intervention is lacking; surgical intervention remains the most appropriate option in most patients.
