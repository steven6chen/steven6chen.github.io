These antibodies may have been present in the recipient at a low level prior to transplant and rise in titer with an anamnestic response after transplant, or may develop afterwards (so-called de novo HLA antibodies). Generally, if HLA antibodies are identified in the potential recipient, the corresponding HLA antigens are avoided in a donor (so-called virtual cross-match). Hyperacute rejection is a rare form of humoral rejection that occurs in the first 24 hours following lung transplantation in recipients who have preformed anti-HLA antibodies.

While BOS is felt to be largely a manifestation of chronic lung transplant rejection, several other risk factors have been identified. Less commonly, chronic vascular rejection is also present and manifests pathologically as atherosclerosis in the pulmonary vasculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Restrictive allograft syndrome &ndash; Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) has been proposed as an additional type of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. In contrast to the obstructive defect characteristic of BOS, RAS is characterized by upper lobe-predominant fibrotic changes and restrictive pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Evidence indicates that it is useful to consider this as a subtype of allograft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], particularly because it has prognostic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>] and patients with RAS and lower lobe or diffuse opacities on computed tomography or peripheral blood eosinophilia have a particularly poor survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant pathologic manifestation of chronic lung transplant rejection in the airways is bronchiolitis obliterans (BO, also called obliterative bronchiolitis or OB), and in the pulmonary vasculature it is atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has adopted a grading system for the pathologic findings in pulmonary allograft rejection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61800 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The early lesions of chronic lung allograft rejection are submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67871\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67871 \">picture 1</a>). These are followed by an ingrowth of fibromyxoid granulation tissue into the airway lumen, resulting in partial or complete obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76542 \">picture 2</a>). Granulation tissue then organizes in a stereotypical cicatricial pattern with resultant obliteration of the lumen of the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51639\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51639 \">picture 3</a>). In some instances, the only residual histologic evidence of small airways is found on elastin stains, which demonstrate a ring of circumferential elastin around an otherwise undetectable airway (vanishing airways disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Other histopathologic findings in BO may include bronchiectasis, organizing pneumonia, and various degrees of acute cellular rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, the pathology in restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) includes parenchymal and pleural changes, with alveolar damage and fibrosis of the alveolar interstitium and interlobular septa and visceral pleural fibrosis with or without obliterative bronchiolitis lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23527375\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic rejection is a major source of long-term morbidity after lung transplantation, as it is with heart-lung transplantation. The exact prevalence is uncertain, in part because of inconsistent definitions used among the various reports and different lengths of follow-up. Because the occurrence of BO increases over time, centers with a longer experience report higher prevalence rates, particularly in their later publications. The largest experience, from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) registry, reports that 48 percent of recipients develop BO or BOS by five years after lung transplant and 76 percent after ten years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54760 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6085992\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of BO remains to be defined. Some evidence suggests that BO is a manifestation of a chronic alloimmune response and airway-centered rejection. However, events other than chronic rejection may also contribute. It may be more accurate to view BO as the final common pathway of a number of insults, including some that are not immunologically mediated.</p><p>Many possible risk factors for the development of BO following lung transplantation have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. A panel of experts organized by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation and subsequent studies have categorized various risk factors as probable or possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52692 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/18,21,22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,22,24,25</a>]. Medication noncompliance is listed as risk factor, perhaps due to erratic immunosuppressive drug levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and an associated increase in acute rejection. The following factors are considered probable or potential contributors to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic rejection</strong> &ndash; Evidence suggesting that BO is a manifestation of chronic rejection comes from a number of observations. Donor-specific alloreactive T-cells and increased levels of class II antigen have been found within the alveolar walls and airway epithelium in recipients diagnosed with BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, an oligoclonal CD4+ T-cell expansion is seen in the peripheral blood of patients with BO, but not in control transplant recipients without BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reactivity of recipient lymphocytes to donor antigen-specific class I antigens has been documented by primed lymphocyte testing (PLT) and other assays in patients with BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The development of anti-HLA class I antibodies may precede the development of BO, and de novo anti-HLA antibodies correlates with the loss of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. An increasing number of HLA mismatches between graft and host, particularly mismatches at the HLA-A locus, are associated with an enhanced risk of BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/19,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, the histopathology and clinical presentation of BO in lung transplant recipients closely resembles the pulmonary manifestations of graft versus host disease after bone marrow transplantation, both histologically and clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In particular, recurrent episodes of acute rejection have been identified as a major risk factor in a number of retrospective epidemiologic analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/12,18,24,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,24,40</a>]. Other studies have found that more severe episodes of acute rejection, and those episodes manifesting with lymphocytic bronchiolitis, are associated with particularly high risk for BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Development of donor-specific HLA antibodies after transplantation has also been associated with an increased risk and greater severity of BOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/33,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,44</a>].

Retrospective analyses have demonstrated that CMV may be a risk factor for BO in lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/35,37,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37,45</a>]. At a single center, 231 lung transplant recipients who received CMV-prophylaxis for the first 4 to 14 weeks post-transplant were prospectively followed for development of CMV pneumonitis and BOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Development of CMV pneumonitis within the first six months was associated with a significantly increased risk of BOS (hazard ratio 2.19; 95% CI 1.36-3.51). In a separate study of 139 lung transplant recipients that prospectively monitored community-acquired respiratory viral (CARV) infections, the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction was increased among those with CARV pneumonia (HR 3.94, 95% CI 1.97-7.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, this association has not been confirmed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

While the causal relationship remains to be determined (that is, does early chronic rejection predispose to airway colonization via impaired host defense, or does colonization incite an immune response that contributes to bronchiolitis), these observations suggest that identification and treatment of colonization may be of merit in preventing the progression of chronic rejection, in addition to potentially reducing the risk of invasive distal airspace infection.<strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary graft dysfunction</strong> (PGD), a multifactorial injury to the transplanted lung that develops in the first 72 hours after transplantation, is associated with later development of BO, and the severity of initial PGD correlates with the risk of BO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/25,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,56,57</a>]. The mechanism for such an association is hypothesized to be due to oxidative damage, impairment of nitric oxide synthesis by pulmonary endothelial cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upregulation of HLA class II antigens on the allograft leading to production of anti-donor antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>].

From this group, 26 patients met diagnostic criteria for BOS and underwent fundoplication. Following the procedure, 16 had lower BOS scores, and 13 no longer met criteria for the diagnosis of BOS. Long-term follow-up of these patients suggests that early fundoplication may result in a lower incidence of BOS and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/62,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,66</a>]. In addition, a retrospective cohort study suggests that impedance analysis provides useful predictive value in addition to pH testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The retrospective nature and size of these studies are insufficient to establish a clear causal relationship between GER and BOS.

Most centers use routine home spirometry. Additional testing with measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity are guided by the results of spirometry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In order to monitor for new onset airflow limitation, a &ldquo;baseline value&rdquo; is ascertained after lung transplantation, by taking the average of the two highest values of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>) obtained at least three weeks apart and without preceding bronchodilator inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The values used to compute baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEF<sub>25-75</sub> may be obtained on different days. If these values improve with a longer postoperative time, the baseline value is recalculated with the higher values. </p><p>The spirometric pattern associated with BOS is airflow limitation with a decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> and the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC) ratio. The degree of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> determines the stage of BOS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66742 \">table 5</a>). As BOS represents a persistent otherwise unexplained airflow limitation, patients are not considered to have BOS until two sets of spirometry obtained at least three weeks apart show a significant decrease from baseline. Once the criteria for BOS have been met, the stage of BOS thereafter is determined by the most recent value of FEV<sub>1</sub>. </p><p>Measurement of flow rates in mid-expiration, as assessed by the forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of the vital capacity (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>), appears to be an earlier and more sensitive indicator of airflow obstruction than a decline in the FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans/abstract/21,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,71-73</a>].

On the other hand, virtually all lung transplant recipients who present with new onset or worsening shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms or signs should have a chest radiograph. In addition, a decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 10 percent or greater should prompt a chest radiograph. </p><p>In the early stages of BO, the chest radiograph is typically unchanged compared with the post-transplantation baseline.

In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is typically performed to exclude infection or malignancy as a cause of deteriorating lung function. For patients with a new opacity on chest imaging, BAL is performed in the affected area. When BAL is performed, samples are sent for cell counts and differential, microbiologic stains and cultures, viral testing (eg, nucleic acid or polymerase chain reaction), and cytology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The BAL findings in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">BOS/BO</span> are nonspecific.

The cause of BAL neutrophilia in BO is not known.

The biopsy is used to exclude other causes of dyspnea and airflow limitation (eg, recurrence of an original lung disease such as sarcoid) and to confirm the diagnosis of BO. However, in a patient with advanced airflow obstruction, the morbidity of the biopsy outweighs its utility, and we do not perform it under these circumstances.

Chronic airway rejection, the more common and morbid of the two types of rejection, is identified histologically by the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67871\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67871 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76542 \">picture 2</a>). When a patient has airflow limitation in the absence of other etiologies, but histopathology documenting BO is not available, a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is made.

It is not known whether such a presentation reflects an etiologic role of viral infection or the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. Alternatively, patients may simply present with subtle increases in exertional dyspnea and a decline in spirometry.
