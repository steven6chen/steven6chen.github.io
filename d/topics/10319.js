In most cases of stress cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. </p><p>Stress cardiomyopathy was first described in 1990 in Japan and has since been increasingly recognized around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1,2,6,7,9,10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7,9,10,16,17</a>]. The term &quot;takotsubo&quot; is taken from the Japanese name for an octopus trap, which has a shape that is similar to the systolic apical ballooning appearance of the LV in the most common and typical form of this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93947\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef93947 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112457\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef112457 \">movie 2</a>); mid and apical segments of the LV are depressed, and there is hyperkinesis of the basal walls. A midventricular type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F112459\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef112459 \">movie 3</a>) and other variants have also been described.

The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607854819\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607854826\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress cardiomyopathy is generally a transient disorder that is managed with supportive therapy. Conservative treatment and resolution of the physical or emotional stress usually result in rapid resolution of symptoms, although some patients develop acute complications such as shock and acute heart failure (HF) that require intensive therapy. Appropriate management of shock varies depending upon whether significant left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present. HF management during acute presentation and following stabilization is generally performed according to standard guidelines except that particular care is taken to avoid volume depletion and vasodilator therapy in patients with LVOT obstruction. Recommendations for anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism in patients with stress cardiomyopathy with LV thrombus or severe LV systolic dysfunction are similar to those for patients post-myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607854832\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotension and shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of patients with stress cardiomyopathy develop cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The development of shock may not correlate with the extent of left or right ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One explanation for discordance between ventricular dysfunction and risk of shock is that some shock is caused by LVOT obstruction, which has been described in 10 to 25 percent of patients with stress cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19-21</a>]. </p><p>Since management of shock differs depending upon whether LVOT obstruction is present, patients who are in shock should undergo urgent echocardiography to assess for LVOT obstruction. In some cases, LVOT obstruction is accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation, similar to that seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607854954\"><span class=\"h3\">Without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest cautious fluid resuscitation for patients with hypotension without significant pulmonary congestion (with or without LVOT obstruction). Patients without significant LVOT obstruction who are hypotensive due to LV systolic dysfunction may require inotropic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>) as a temporizing measure. Since the condition is potentially caused by catecholamine excess, the impact of sympathomimetics remains to be established. In a patient with hypotension due to pump failure, inotropic agents may induce LVOT obstruction, but the degree is usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Inotropic therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop moderate to severe LVOT obstruction; a change in the therapeutic approach is not necessary if mild LVOT obstruction develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy#H123895523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;, section on 'Management of hypotensive patients'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with persistent hypotension with symptoms or evidence of consequent end-organ hypoperfusion despite optimization of filling pressures and inotropic therapy may require vasopressor therapy. In this setting, invasive monitoring can be helpful to assess filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.) </p><p>Mechanical circulatory support (eg, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation [IABP]) is the preferred therapy when there is marked LV dysfunction associated with severe hypotension or shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy#H123895523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;, section on 'Management of hypotensive patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607855012\"><span class=\"h3\">With left ventricular outflow tract obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to hypotension due only to pump failure, hypotension associated with moderate to severe LVOT obstruction should <strong>not</strong> be treated with inotropic agents, because they can worsen the degree of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>].</p><p>The recommended approach to patients with stress cardiomyopathy with moderate to severe LVOT obstruction is similar to that for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LVOT obstruction and hemodynamic collapse. Therapy includes the use of beta blockers, which can improve hemodynamics by causing resolution of the obstruction. In addition, in the absence of significant pulmonary congestion, preload should be increased with leg elevation and fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-medical-therapy#H4268009218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Medical therapy&quot;, section on 'Acute hemodynamic collapse in the setting of LVOT obstruction'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with LVOT obstruction and severe hypotension who either do not tolerate or do not adequately respond to beta blockers, an alpha agonist may be added with caution and close monitoring. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenylephrine</a> is a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist that may reduce the gradient by increasing afterload, thereby improving overall hemodynamics. This treatment may be helpful to support blood pressure while a beta blocker is administered to reduce inotropy. However, the vasoconstrictive effects of alpha agonists may be harmful, particularly in those patients who can be prone to coronary vasospasm. Thus, if phenylephrine is used, it should be done with a high degree of caution and very close monitoring of hemodynamics and tissue perfusion. The utility of noncatecholamine agents such as vasopressin or terlipressin in this setting is unknown at this time, but these may be considered as alternative vasopressors.</p><p>In patients with LVOT obstruction with severe hypotension that is unresponsive to initial medical therapy and volume resuscitation, we suggest the use of an IABP. As with patients in shock due to pump failure, those with LVOT obstruction may benefit from an IABP, although there is a slight risk that afterload reduction from the IABP will worsen the degree of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], so the effect of IABP on the LVOT gradient should be evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607855110\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute HF is managed according to standard recommendations, which include supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation as needed, intravenous diuretics to treat volume overload, and vasodilator therapy as needed to correct elevated filling pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV afterload. Volume depletion and vasodilator therapy should be avoided in patients with LVOT obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>There are no specific randomized trial data to define an optimal medical regimen for stress cardiomyopathy. We treat hemodynamically stable patients with standard medications for HF with reduced ejection fraction, especially as the diagnosis may not be definitive at the time of presentation These include beta blocker therapy and, for patients without LVOT obstruction, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) and diuretics as necessary to treat volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Observational data have suggested that acute use of beta blockers may not improve in-hospital mortality. In a retrospective analysis of 2672 patients, 423 had beta blocker therapy initiated within the first two days, and this group did not have reduced 30-day in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stress cardiomyopathy is a transient disorder, and the appropriate duration of medical therapy is not known given the lack of clinical trial data. We generally treat patients with a standard HF medical regimen until there is recovery of systolic function, which occurs in one to four weeks in most cases. Since the condition may recur, we favor continuing adrenergic blockade with either beta blockers or combined alpha and beta blockers indefinitely in the absence of contraindications or intolerance.</p><p>Further study is needed to identify effective therapy in patients with stress cardiomyopathy. Observational data suggest that beta blocker therapy may not prevent this condition or its recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Over 30 percent of patients in the International Takotsubo Registry study were taking beta blockers when they developed the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There was no evidence of survival benefit at one year from use of a beta blocker at discharge. In addition, 29 of the 57 patients who subsequently developed recurrent stress cardiomyopathy were taking beta blockers at the time of the second event. In contrast, use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB was associated with improved survival at one year. These observational findings are hypothesis generating and are not sufficient to define therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607855168\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential risk of intraventricular thrombus formation and systemic embolization should be addressed in patients with LV thrombus or severe LV systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography (and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging if available) should include evaluation for potential thrombus as well as assessment of the extent of wall motion abnormality. Ventricular thrombus was identified in 1.3 percent of the 1750 patients with stress cardiomyopathy in the International Takotsubo Registry study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Scant data are available to guide anticoagulant therapy to prevent thromboembolism in patients with stress cardiomyopathy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect data are available from randomized trials of anticoagulation to prevent LV thrombus in patients with acute myocardial infarction. As discussed in detail separately, these trials found that approximately 10 days of anticoagulation reduced the incidence of LV thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction#H16390947\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular thrombus after acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Prevention of embolic events'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of anticoagulation to prevent embolization in patients with known LV thrombus is supported by indirect data from observational studies in patients with LV thrombus after myocardial infarction. In these studies, anticoagulation during a period of four to six months was associated with a reduced rate of embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-ventricular-thrombus-after-acute-myocardial-infarction#H16390947\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left ventricular thrombus after acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Prevention of embolic events'</a>.) </p><p/><p>We recommend anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) if intraventricular thrombus is detected, with a suggested duration of approximately three months. The duration of anticoagulation may be modified based on the rate of recovery of cardiac function and resolution of the thrombus. For patients without thrombus but with severe LV systolic dysfunction (ie, ejection fraction &lt;30 percent) and low bleeding risk, we suggest anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) until akinesis or dyskinesis has resolved or for three months, whichever is shorter.</p><p>Standard recommendations for antiplatelet therapy apply to patients with coexisting coronary atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607855250\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most patients with stress cardiomyopathy recover, the risk of severe in-hospital complications is similar to that in patients with acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, the risk of a composite of catecholamine use, cardiogenic shock, the use of invasive or noninvasive ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death was 19.1 percent in patients with stress cardiomyopathy in the International Takotsubo Registry study versus 19.3 percent in a control group of patients with acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In-hospital mortality rates have ranged from 0 to 8 percent (4.1 percent in the International Takotsubo Registry study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/3,4,7,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7,15,16</a>]. </p><p>A preliminary report proposed a risk score to predict the likelihood of acute heart failure (HF) based on the presence or absence of the following three variables: age &gt;70 years, presence of a physical stressor, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the development cohort of 118 patients, the likelihood of developing acute HF was &lt;10 percent in the absence of these risk factors. With one, two, or three risk factors present, the risk was approximately 28, 58, and 85 percent, respectively. A similar gradient of risk was observed when the risk score was applied to the 52 patients in the validation cohort.</p><p>Patients who survive the acute episode typically recover systolic ventricular function within one to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4,7-9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9,25</a>]. In two series, for example, the mean LVEF increased from 29 percent at presentation to 63 percent at a mean of six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and from a median of 20 percent at presentation to 60 percent at two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>However, the risk of adverse events in this older adult population continues after hospital discharge. In the International Takotsubo Registry study, the composite rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, stroke, or transient ischemic attack) during the first 30 days after admission was 7.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. During long-term follow-up, the rate of death from any cause was 5.6 percent per patient year and the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 9.9 percent per patient-year, but no control population was available for comparison. The risk of recurrence was 1.8 percent per patient year. &#160;</p><p>In a study of 100 patients over a mean follow-up of 4.4&plusmn;4.6 years, 17 patients died, but there was no difference in survival compared with an age- and gender-matched population. The recurrence rate was 11.4 percent. In another series of 136 patients, all-cause mortality of stress cardiomyopathy patients was increased compared with that expected in an age- and gender-matched general population; however, the excess mortality was predominantly in the first year and was predominantly due to noncardiac causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] with the most common causes being cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2284529140\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
