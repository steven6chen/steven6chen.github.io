Racemic, dl-sotalol was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in October of 1992 and subsequently for atrial fibrillation (AF) in February of 2000. Since the patent for dl-sotalol has expired, generic dl-sotalol preparations are now available. D- and l-stereoisomers of sotalol have been studied individually, but only dl-sotalol is commercially available. The two isomers contribute to the unique antiarrhythmic properties of sotalol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The d isomer prolongs repolarization by blocking IKr, the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current that is responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the action potential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71390 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This represents a class III effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The l isomer has two actions: it prolongs repolarization and it has beta blocking activity.

The prolongation of cardiac action potential duration does not appear to be related to concurrent beta blockade, since d-sotalol, which has little beta blocking activity, produces a similar delay in repolarization as l-sotalol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The class III effect results from blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) that is responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the action potential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71390 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> does not affect either the resting potential or rapid phase 0 depolarization that is mediated by sodium entry into the cells.

Reverse use dependence is defined as an inverse correlation between the heart rate and the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As a result, the QT interval is prolonged as the heart rate slows, which could explain the association between bradycardia and antiarrhythmic drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) and the possible decrease in drug efficacy at higher heart rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Proarrhythmia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">d-Sotalol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preparation containing only the d isomer has been developed as a &quot;pure&quot; class III drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, in the Survival with Oral D-sotalol (SWORD) trial of patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and either a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or symptomatic heart failure and a remote MI, d-sotalol therapy, compared with placebo, was associated with a significant <strong>increase</strong> in mortality that was largely due to an increase in presumed arrhythmic deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Since the QRS duration is not prolonged, the increase in QT interval results solely from delayed repolarization (ie, the JT interval) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a review of 114 patients given chronic oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> therapy, the average increase in QT interval was 80 and 91 msec with 320 and 640 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the increase in QTc, which is corrected for heart rate, was less prominent (21 and 30 msec, respectively).

As a result, sotalol should be initiated and doses increased in a hospital with facilities for cardiac rhythm monitoring and assessment. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Proarrhythmia'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency with which adverse cardiac events occur was illustrated in a retrospective study of 417 patients who underwent 597 drug trials for conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) or for initiation of maintenance therapy after electrical cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the 72 trials with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> (80 mg orally twice daily), adverse cardiac events occurred in 18 percent: bradyarrhythmias occurred in eight (11 percent), ventricular arrhythmias in two (2.8 percent), and QT prolongation in one (1.4 percent).

Complications occurred within the first three days in 22 of the patients (88 percent).</p><p>After discharge, we generally have the patient return for an electrocardiogram (ECG) at 48 to 72 hours and again at one and two weeks, looking for QT interval prolongation and bradyarrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral sotalol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended initial dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> in adults is 80 mg twice daily whether used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation. If necessary, the initial dose can be increased gradually to 240 or 320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Dose adjustments should be made at three day intervals so that steady-state plasma concentrations can be attained and the QT interval monitored.

In addition, it should be used with caution in patients with reduced renal function, since decreased clearance can result in drug accumulation and possible proarrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>It has been stated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> should not be given with class IA antiarrhythmic drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>) because these drugs may also prolong refractoriness and the combination would further increase the propensity for proarrhythmia. Data exists, however, suggesting that the combination of low dose sotalol and a class IA agent is very effective in preventing the induction of ventricular tachycardia and the spontaneous recurrence of arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a study of 32 patients, for example, this combination markedly prolonged ventricular refractoriness (especially at higher heart rates), thereby eliminating the &quot;reverse use dependency&quot; (a reduction in refractoriness as heart rate increases) observed when sotalol is administered as a sole agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-and-major-side-effects-of-sotalol/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1358169962\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The two isomers contribute to the unique antiarrhythmic properties of sotalol, with d isomer prolonging repolarization by blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current that is responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the action potential, while the l isomer both prolongs repolarization and has beta blocking activity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology and mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> on the action potential duration shows <strong>reverse use dependence</strong>, which is seen with other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. Reverse use dependence is defined as an inverse correlation between the heart rate and the QT interval. As a result, the QT interval is prolonged as the heart rate slows, with an associated risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) and a possible decrease in drug efficacy at higher heart rates. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Class III activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardic and proarrhythmic events occur in up to 20 percent of patients after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> therapy and with each upward dosing adjustment. As a result, sotalol should be initiated and doses increased in a hospital with facilities for cardiac rhythm monitoring and assessment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommended initial dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> in adults is 80 mg twice daily whether used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation (AF). If necessary, the initial dose can be increased gradually to a total daily dose of 240 mg or 320 mg. Dose adjustments should be made at three day intervals so that steady-state plasma concentrations can be attained and the QT interval monitored. The dosing interval requires modification in patients with impaired renal function and reduced creatinine clearance. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oral sotalol'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Renal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless the cause can be reversed because of the risk of further QT interval prolongation and proarrhythmia, particularly TdP.
