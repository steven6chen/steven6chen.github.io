Skin lesions include patches, plaques, or tumors that may be localized or widespread and erythroderma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SS is defined as a distinctive erythrodermic CTCL with leukemic involvement of malignant T cells that typically match the clone in the skin. </p><p/><p>SS may be considered to have either evolved from MF (ie, not initially meeting the criteria for SS) or, more often, to present de novo<em> </em>with full blown signs and symptoms of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In either case, both MF and SS are defined histologically and staged by the same criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast to <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> MF, SS is much more symptomatic, has a lower potential for remission, and lower expected survival.</p><p>In 2007, the staging system for MF and SS was revised to incorporate blood involvement and a standardized definition of erythroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2011, further revisions to the blood and lymph node staging were published that further define and standardize the extracutaneous extent of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These changes in staging permit one to assess the outcomes in patients with erythrodermic MF separately from those of SS. &#160;</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of SS. The diagnosis of MF and the management of these two entities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced stage (IIB to IV) mycosis fungoides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449461398\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a small percentage of cases of SS are associated with human T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(HTLV1/2),</span> which are endemic in southern Japan, the Caribbean islands, and part of the Middle East, the cause of most cases of SS remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The tumor cells appear to be derived from skin homing CD4 positive T cells or central memory T cells that typically express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and high levels of the chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], which provides them with the capacity to traffic bi-directionally into and out of the skin in response to the appropriate chemokines. They are recognized by the frequent loss of CD26 in perhaps more than 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], as well as the loss of CD7 in about 50 percent of cases. The typical immunophenotype of the abnormal peripheral blood T cell population is CD3+, CD4+, CD7-, CD26-, CD8-. Occasionally, SS can occur with the malignant population demonstrating a CD8+ phenotype. SS with the CD8+ phenotype can be associated with retroviral infections <span class=\"nowrap\">(HTLV-1/2</span> or HIV). As such, it is recommended that these serologies be obtained in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H1060895\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotyping confirming T cell origin (CD3+, CD4+)'</a> below.)</p><p>There are substantial data that patients with SS exhibit endogenous immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The cause of impaired immune function has been attributed, at least partially, to the increased production of type 2 T cell (Th2) cytokines by the malignant clone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which can antagonize Th1 immunity leading to decreased IL-12 and interferon gamma production, which are critical for anti-tumor immunity. Activated T cells of patients with SS may also produce increased IL-10 and TGF-beta, which can further complicate the impairment of cell-mediated immunity. In some cases, the malignant T cells can behave like regulatory T cells by manifesting Foxp3 and increased CTLA4 expression with enhanced production of IL-10 or TGF-beta, leading to suppression of normal T cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Increased production of Th2 cytokines have been implicated in some of the characteristic immune abnormalities identified among patients with SS, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased T cell responses to antigens and mitogens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired cell-mediated cytotoxicity, including natural killer cell activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased levels of serum IgE</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral eosinophilia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired dendritic cell functions</p><p/><p>Other causes for depressed Th1 immunity and impaired cell-mediated immunity include increased expression of programmed death domain 1 (PD-1) on the malignant T cells, which can inhibit cytotoxic T cell function. Furthermore, the malignant T cells, as well as CD8 T cells in the setting of SS, often exhibit increased expression of TIGIT, which can also down-modulate normal cellular immune functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, the malignant T cells fail to normally upregulate CD40 ligand expression during activation, which may lead to impaired activation and differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs). It is quite clear that a decline in the number and function of DCs parallels an increase in the circulating burden of malignant T cells. A substantial loss of the normal T cell repertoire also appears to parallel the progression of disease and likely contributes to immune dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These findings have helped guide immune modulatory therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Multiple defects of proapoptotic pathways have been identified, including decreased expression of Fas (CD95), which may be due to hypermethylation of the Fas gene promoter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This abnormality may be overcome by treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> as well as the use of interferon alpha or gamma, leading to the upregulation of CD95 expression, rendering cells more susceptible to Fas ligand mediated death. Other defects include increased expression of the apoptosis inhibitor cFLIP, as well as tumor cell loss of TRAIL-receptor 2 leading to resistance to TRAIL. Defects in apoptosis are presumed to lead to accumulation of the malignant T cells in vivo.</p><p>Molecular gene expression profiles and genetic analyses lend understanding to the proliferative nature of the malignant T cells and to the immune dysregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/11,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17-19</a>]. As an example, alterations in expression of certain transcription factors important for T cell differentiation, particularly upregulation of GATA3, and downregulation of expression of STAT4, may account for the Th2 phenotype in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. The observation of the loss of nuclear pro-IL16 provides further insight into mechanisms underlying the enhanced proliferation of the malignant T cell population. The presence of nuclear pro-IL16 normally contributes to T cell quiescence. Therefore, its loss would lead to cell cycle progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other valuable insights include the observation that T-plastin is expressed in the malignant T cells of patients with SS; this gene is not normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its aberrant expression can facilitate identification of the lymphoma cells for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other findings include mutations and deletions in chromatin remodeling genes, and gain-of-function mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Growing evidence from gene expression profiles, microRNA profiling, and cell marker studies suggests that mycosis fungoides (MF) and SS may be separate entities with differing pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/6,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23-25</a>]. Comparative genomic hybridization has identified chromosomal abnormalities that occur in both MF and SS and abnormalities that are present in either MF or SS, but not both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Importantly, the malignant T cells of patients with SS have been shown to express CD27, CCR7, L-selectin, and CCR4, which are markers of central memory T cells. In contrast, the malignant T cells of patients with MF fail to express CCR7, L-selectin, and CD27 but do express high levels of CCR4 and CLA, which is typical of skin-resident effector T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of MF are discussed separately.

In the United States, analysis of the population based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data from 2001 to 2005 has estimated the incidence at 0.8 cases per million persons per year with a male:female ratio of 2.11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Similarly, data from the Cancer Registry of Norway from 2000 to 2003 estimated the incidence at approximately 0.9 cases per million persons per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. SS is a disease of older adults with very few cases reported among patients &lt;30 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the United States, the incidence appears higher among Whites (0.36 cases per million persons per year) than among Blacks (0.04 cases per million persons per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], but a retrospective study of 393 SS patients that included a high percentage of African Americans reported that 55 percent were White and 43 percent were African American [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. SS is not an inherited disease, and siblings and children of patients with SS do not have an increased risk of developing SS.

The severity of erythema and the body surface area (BSA) involved may wax and wane, but at some point in the disease course the skin involvement should cover over 80 percent BSA so as to meet the disease definition from The International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL), European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC).

Initial studies reported that a significant minority of patients will present with splenic enlargement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Other visceral involvement, especially of the liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract is uncommon at the time of diagnosis, but may occur late in the course of the disease, usually after failure of various treatments. </p><p>An assessment of potential visceral involvement is included in the initial staging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A computed tomography (CT), or a combined positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT,</span> in patients with biopsy proven erythrodermic MF or erythroderma and lymphadenopathy is recommended. This is discussed in more detail separately.

Pruritus is not necessarily related to the degree of blood involvement or the extent and depth of erythema. Pruritus may exacerbate sleep dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;, section on 'Pruritus'</a>.)</p><p>Optimal therapy of pruritus is not well defined. Therapy that ameliorates disease may diminish pruritus, and phototherapy may have a separate beneficial effect beside disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. High doses of antihistamines are occasionally useful in controlling the pruritus, as are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In some cases, systemic steroids are the only treatment that offers relief. Iron stores should be repleted because iron deficiency may exacerbate pruritus. One study reported that IL-31 production by the malignant T cells correlated with the degree of pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]; anti-IL-31 receptor antibody may reduce pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059838\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63648088\"><span class=\"h3\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SS are at increased risk for infection due to a combination of immune dysfunction and physical factors.

They have an increase in the severity of viral (eg, herpes) and bacterial infections. Indwelling catheters or port placement are to be avoided if possible. In one study, the majority of patients with SS demonstrated colonization with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> in the skin or nares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. One should have a low threshold to treat with systemic antibiotics as temperatures can be normal in the face of bacteremia due to the loss of body heat through dilated skin vasculature and a disrupted skin barrier, and blood cultures can be negative despite systemic signs of infection. Patients treated with antibiotics to eradicate the bacteria often demonstrate clinical improvement of signs of skin involvement with the lymphoma. There have also been reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to polyomavirus in patients with SS in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Generally there are atypical lymphocytes in a sparse dermal infiltrate along with epidermotropism (movement of the atypical lymphocytes into the epidermis), which is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of MF. The more diagnostic intra-epidermal aggregates of atypical cells (ie, Pautrier's microabscesses) may or may not be present. Significant edema and a nonspecific infiltrate of inflammatory T cells may predominate, making diagnosis more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Clonality studies can be done confidently on formalin fixed tissue using the BioMed2 primers so that taking a separate biopsy solely for fresh tissue technique is not necessary. The initial clonality testing typically first addresses potential <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> rearrangements since this is the final part of a chain reaction in lymphocyte maturation. However, TCR <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> clonality testing can be negative in cases demonstrating <span class=\"nowrap\">alfa/beta</span> clonal rearrangement.

The largest node should undergo excisional biopsy (rather than a core biopsy or fine needle aspirate), as lymph node staging in MF and SS is dependent on architectural changes. This also permits evaluation for other causes of node enlargement. <em>TCR</em> gene clonality is usually present with nodal lymphoma and should be expected to match that found in the skin and blood.</p><p>In contrast to other types of primary cutaneous lymphoma, enlarged lymph nodes in MF and SS may histopathologically demonstrate reactive change, dermatopathic features, or frank lymphoma. The amount <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> size of the abnormal lymphocytes and the degree of effacement of the normal lymph node architecture are used to give a grade of involvement with one of two different scoring systems (NCI and Dutch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

S&eacute;zary cells are best demonstrated on a buffy coat preparation of the peripheral blood, also called a &ldquo;S&eacute;zary cell&rdquo; prep. Typical S&eacute;zary cells are larger than the size of a normal resting lymphocyte (approximately the same size as a normal monocyte) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, a subset of patients demonstrates a smaller variant of S&eacute;zary cells that are approximately the size of a resting lymphocyte.

Small numbers of S&eacute;zary cells can be observed in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals or those with other benign or malignant diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>S&eacute;zary cell counts are subjective and there is considerable inter-observer variability. However, they are relatively inexpensive to perform and may be useful in clinical practice, especially if all assessments are performed by the same cytopathologist. S&eacute;zary cell counts are usually reported as a percentage of lymphocytes examined, so to get a total S&eacute;zary cell count, the percentage S&eacute;zary cells must be multiplied by the absolute lymphocyte count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1060227\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow cytometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow cytometry of T cell subsets in the blood provides an objective, quantifiable and reproducible means of identifying and tracking blood involvement in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,56</a>]. Flow cytometry may help to define subsets of lymphocytes that are highly correlated with blood tumor burden. The subsets CD4+CD7- and CD4+CD26- are the most commonly utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. The most frequent aberrancies observed in more than 90 percent of patients were a defective CD26 expression or a modification of antigen expression intensity (dim or bright), whereas CD7 expression always varied greatly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

However, the loss of CD7 or CD26 is not distinctive for malignant T cells: they can be seen with aging and with antigenic stimulation and are seen in a small population of normal CD4+ cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There has been correlation of CD4+CD26- counts and morphologically identifiable tumor cells in the blood in at least one published study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], but in many cases there may be discordance between the number of S&eacute;zary cells identified by peripheral smear cytology and the number of atypical lymphocytes with abnormal phenotype identified by flow cytometry.</p><p>Flow cytometry is the preferred method for following patients on therapy or in trials.

The percentage of the lymphocyte population or absolute count of CD4+CD7- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CD4+CD26- T cells or the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> ratio can be used to determine B status for staging purposes and for assessment of response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1060235\"><span class=\"h3\">TCR gene rearrangement clonality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TCR gene rearrangement clonality of the neoplastic lymphocytes in the blood is important to confirm the relationship of any abnormal population of cells to the skin lymphoma. The clone should match that in the skin, keeping in mind, however, that more than one clonal rearrangement may be found if more than one biopsy is performed at two anatomically distinct skin sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449462785\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10118606\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SS should be considered in any patient presenting with erythroderma, regardless of underlying or preceding skin conditions that in themselves can cause erythroderma. The initial evaluation includes a biopsy of involved skin with assessment of the morphology, immunophenotype, and clonality (T cell receptor gene rearrangement status) of cellular infiltrates. If the findings on skin biopsy are suggestive of a cutaneous T cell lymphoma, evaluation of the peripheral blood with a peripheral smear, flow cytometry, and clonality studies can help to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis of SS is suspect but the work-up is inconclusive, these patients should continue to be re-evaluated over time. Those originally presenting with MF may evolve to SS. In one study with a median follow-up of 1.6&plusmn;2.2 years (0.5 to 9 years), 6 of 31 erythrodermic mycosis fungoides patients (eMF) with B<sub>1</sub> blood staging evolved toward SS in a median of 1.2 years (range 0.5 to 2.5 years), all of them expressing blood biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10118634\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is always best to biopsy the most indurated area of skin. If more than one type of lesion (eg, confluent patchy erythema and follicular-based papules or livido-like erythema) is present, a biopsy of each representative type of lesion should be performed. This helps to determine both the extent of involvement and identifies certain prognostic factors, such as folliculotropism. Because the skin infiltrate in SS is generally much less dense than that of plaque stage MF, it is important to minimize any interventions that could affect the infiltrate prior to taking the biopsy: these include topical or systemic corticosteroids and any other immunosuppressive medication. In general the patient should be off of these agents, especially topical steroids, for at least 14 days prior to skin biopsy to help maximize the potential for a firm diagnosis. A minimum of a 4 mm punch biopsy is recommended. In most cases, all pathologic studies including clonality can be performed on formalin fixed tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10118613\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SS is made based upon a pathologic evaluation of the peripheral blood and skin interpreted within the clinical context. The specific criteria used for the diagnosis of SS are helpful not only for research purposes but also in the determination of the treatment of patients with this condition. The International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL), European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC) have grappled with a standardized definition of SS under expanding knowledge about this disease. We agree with the consensus criteria published in, which require the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythroderma defined as erythema covering at least 80 percent body surface area</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clonal TCR rearrangement in the blood identified by PCR or southern blot analysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An absolute S&eacute;zary cell count of at least 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> <strong>or</strong> one of the following two criteria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased CD4+ or CD3+ cells with a CD4 to CD8 ratio of 10 or more</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased CD4+ cells with an abnormal phenotype (such as a CD4+CD7- ratio &ge;40 percent or a CD4+CD26- ratio &ge;30 percent)</p><p/><p>This is equivalent to the T<sub>4</sub> (erythroderma) plus B<sub>2</sub> designation in the TNMB classification syndrome for MF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 \">table 1</a>). Since publication of this revision, blood involvement in <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> (B<sub>2</sub>) has been defined further to include absolute number of neoplastic cells identified by flow cytometry (ie, &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- lymphocytes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For S&eacute;zary cells, B<sub>0</sub> is still defined as &le;5 percent S&eacute;zary <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> as proposed in 1979 by the MF Cooperative Group, but B<sub>0</sub> is also defined as &lt;250 S&eacute;zary <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> to allow the same unit measurement to be used for B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>. When blood involvement is identified using flow cytometry, B<sub>0</sub> may also be defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;250/microL</span> or &lt;15 percent CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- cells. All of the definitions of B<sub>0</sub> are in line with normal values in the blood.</p><p>A representative skin biopsy demonstrating histologic changes that are suggestive of MF is supportive of the diagnosis. At a minimum, there should be a dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with atypical cells and exocytosis of lymphocytes into the epidermis. Immunophenotyping showing a CD4+ or CD8+ predominant infiltrate with deletion of CD7 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CD5 would be supportive of the diagnosis. Analysis of the peripheral blood by either S&eacute;zary cell prep or flow cytometric analysis should identify a significant abnormal population of lymphocytes.

The biopsy would not be expected to show all the immunophenotypic features of MF, nor would the blood involvement typical of SS be present unless the entire picture is in fact representative of PRP-like <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1060544\"><span class=\"h3\">Atopic dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both atopic dermatitis and <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> can present with erythroderma. Given the frequency of atopic dermatitis in the general population, it is not uncommon for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> to have both disorders. One study suggested that specific IgE reactivity to common allergens is common in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Conversely, another study reported that zero of nine patients with SS had any IgE reactivity to Staph enterotoxin or to 103 to 112 environmental and food allergens tested. All four patients with &quot;pre-SS&quot; (erythroderma, elevated total IgE and CD4+ skin infiltrate but not otherwise meeting criteria for SS) and three of three patients with atopic dermatitis had both high reactivity towards Staph enterotoxin and multiple environmental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> food allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Lichenification and prurigo nodularis are common in long-standing atopic dermatitis, as is eyelid involvement, but otherwise there are no typical skin-associated findings that can help to suggest atopic dermatitis versus <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span>. Both eczema and <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> can be accompanied by eosinophilia in the blood and tissue, although it would be unlikely that patients with atopic dermatitis would meet the criteria for B2 staging of <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> in the blood. Lymphadenopathy may be seen in <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> and in patients with atopy and hyper IgE. On skin biopsy, atopic dermatitis has spongiosis as a primary finding, and this can be a helpful clue since the histologic criteria for patch stage MF specifically excludes significant spongiosis. Finding a CD4+ infiltrate and a clonal TCR rearrangement does not exclude atopic dermatitis as a cause of the erythroderma.

This can be a reaction to a topical application (eg, fragrance), exposure to an allergen that is in contact with widespread body areas (eg, fabric softener), systemic exposure to chemicals that are cross reactive with another agent of which the patient has prior contact allergy (eg, ingestion of cashews in someone with allergic reaction to poison ivy), or a generalized photoallergic dermatitis (eg, compositae). Clinically, the distribution of the rash may help to direct one to a particular type of reaction. These patients do not typically have alopecia, nail changes, or keratoderma, such as can be seen with some cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span>. Histologic changes may be similar to those seen with eczema. Patch testing, which could help reveal the inciting agent, is impossible when the patient is erythrodermic. Systemic steroids may be needed to quiet the rash to a point that patch testing is possible.

There may be some clinical clues as to the UVL relationship, such as sparing of finger webs, upper eyelids, behind the ears, and inside skin creases. Histologically, this can be very difficult to distinguish from MF and SS, although there is a tendency for the infiltrate to be more CD8 than CD4 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

It rarely occurs following solid organ transplantation or in other settings where an immune incompetent person receives an infusion of immune competent cells that result in a T cell targeted attack. Acute GVHD may be associated with a widespread erythematous rash or erythroderma. The skin biopsy may reveal dermal lymphocytes with varying degrees of dyskeratosis of epidermal cells. The clinical setting and the associated findings of lung, liver, ocular, and GI disease can usually help distinguish this condition from SS.

Many of these later turn out to have MF or SS, although at presentation they do not meet diagnostic criteria. Erythroderma can also be a nonspecific finding of an underlying systemic B or T cell lymphoma. The histologic findings are nonspecific. At a minimum, a chest radiograph should be performed. If peripheral adenopathy is present, a computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed in addition to biopsy of a representative lymph node. Any patient with erythroderma without a definitive diagnosis should be followed closely and repeat biopsies of skin or biopsy of any new enlarged lymph node performed.

ATL, however, is much more likely to have disseminated extracutaneous disease with frequent lymphoma in the nodes, liver, bone, and central nervous system. A key differentiating feature is the presence of HTLV-I in the malignant cells of ATL, which can be determined by testing for the antibody in the blood.
