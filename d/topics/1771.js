Deficiencies of micronutrients following bariatric surgery can arise from several mechanisms that include preoperative deficiency, reduced dietary intake, malabsorption, and inadequate supplementation. Since obesity is a risk factor of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, all patients should be screened and deficiencies corrected prior to surgery. The postoperative diet and texture progression, micronutrient deficiencies, and their management are reviewed here. </p><p>Bypass procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch <span class=\"nowrap\">(BPD/DS),</span> are known to cause micronutrient malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. The sleeve gastrectomy (SG), which is the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in certain regions, does not involve intestinal bypass but can still lead to certain nutritional deficits. Any bariatric procedure can result in malnutrition if a proper diet is not followed. The specific bariatric procedures, indications, and outcomes are reviewed elsewhere and include the following topics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-perioperative-morbidity-and-mortality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations: Perioperative morbidity and mortality&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-and-long-term-management-of-the-uncomplicated-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative and long-term management of the uncomplicated patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIET AND TEXTURE PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diet after bariatric surgery is based upon a staged approach with emphasis on nutritional needs at each stage of healing and weight loss. Additionally, consideration is given to the texture and volume of food that patients can tolerate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While all post-bariatric surgery patients will benefit from a well-planned dietary advancement that ensures proper healing of the surgery and develops lifelong healthy eating habits, such plans have to take into consideration a large variation in food tolerance depending upon the nature of the bariatric operation (eg, size of remnant stomach, presence of gastrojejunostomy, etc.) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62266 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50516 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4218747629\"><span class=\"h2\">Early (postoperative) diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At each diet stage, nutrient needs and food texture should be emphasized. Although postoperative diet plans are generally surgeon or institution specific, the following approach to the nutritional management of the postoperative bariatric patient is generalizable to most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62266 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50516 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1457068527\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage 1 and 2 diet: Hydration and liquids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immediate postoperative diet should emphasize hydration and protein intake. Patients are started on a clear liquid diet (stage 1) and, after a brief period, are advanced to full liquids and possibly pureed foods, which they will consume for up to several weeks after the operation (stage 2 diet). Early hydration and consumption of protein and carbohydrates to meet metabolic needs are essential, and the stage 2 diet helps to avoid irritation to the surgical areas of the digestive tract. </p><p>Many programs discharge patients from the hospital on a stage 2 diet that includes liquid sources of protein that also contain small amounts of carbohydrate. Other programs discharge patients on a pureed diet. Patients should be taught to recognize signs and symptoms of dehydration. All patients should receive preoperative education that focuses on their postoperative nutritional needs, including guidelines regarding the consumption of an adequate amount of clear and full liquids daily to maintain hydration and urine output. Surgical patients should be provided educational materials, shopping lists, and sample meal plans of when they should be consuming clear and full liquids and how much. Such guidelines should be reinforced through postoperative discharge instructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3852670991\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage 3 diet: Solid foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 14 days after surgery, as the gastrointestinal tract heals and patients are able to tolerate more solid-textured foods, the diet is advanced to include soft solid foods with an emphasis on protein sources, some carbohydrates, and fiber (eg, fruits and vegetables). Patients can advance their diet (texture and portions) as tolerated as long as they follow guidelines for the stage 3 diet. Throughout all of the diet stages, patients should be counselled to consume adequate fluid to prevent dehydration. </p><p>Food tolerance varies widely among patients. Patients are advised to eat slowly, chew food extensively, stop eating as soon as they reach satiety, and avoid taking food and beverages at the same time. Vomiting and epigastric discomfort frequently occur if food is ingested too quickly or when the patient eats more than the stomach pouch or sleeve can hold. During the first few months after surgery, most patients learn to recognize the early satiety provided by a small gastric volume. Because overeating can result in vomiting or nausea, most patients quickly learn to control portion sizes and food reactions. Guidance by an experienced bariatric registered dietitian is strongly advised during the transition between diet stages, per the clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1214851487\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage 4 diet: Micronutrient supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage 4 is when patients reach a stable weight (maintenance weight). Because of the wide variability in the rate of weight loss, healing, food tolerance, and the amount of food patients can consume, it is unpredictable when a patient will reach this stage. Some programs do not have a stage 4 diet, as most patients already tolerate regular foods by stage 3.</p><p>As patients are advancing their diet, they should be encouraged to consume a healthy, balanced diet. While some programs start micronutrient supplementation as early as hospital discharge with chewable or liquid vitamins, all programs require daily vitamin and mineral supplementation by the stage 4 diet. The recommended postoperative micronutrient supplementation following a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric sleeve procedure is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114101 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/1,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3274654240\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrient deficiency, supplementation, and repletion'</a> below.) </p><p>In the past, patients were instructed to take one or two pills of multivitamin a day after bariatric surgery. However, there is wide variability in the formulations of multivitamins, and most do not contain enough elemental iron or calcium to meet the needs of bariatric patients. Thus, a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach does not work for every bariatric surgical patient; supplementation needs to be tailored to each individual's nutritional intake and status based upon regular review of blood chemistries. At a minimum, the supplement should contain the recommended daily allowance (RDA) amounts for vitamin K, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a>, zinc, thiamin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, iron, and copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The minimum amounts of daily vitamins and minerals required to prevent deficiency are summarized in this table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114815\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114815 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H952676654\" class=\"local\">'Postsurgical screening'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrient management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term eating habits are in part determined by the patient's motivation, willingness, and ability to adhere to a healthy diet. Dietary intake longer-term is also dependent upon the type of bariatric procedure performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the changes in both the pouch size and gut hormone signaling, patients may not feel physical hunger early after RYGB, and, when they do eat, they experience early satiety. As weight stabilizes and the need for external calories increases, sensations of hunger and satiety awareness will return; patients may also develop food intolerances and aversions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p>Learning how to choose healthy foods, avoid skipping meals, and prepare meals and snacks on a daily basis is part of the new skills and goals all patients must learn. Patients may need continued reminders that the surgery has changed their body but not the environment. Frequent education, emotional support, and counseling sessions with a registered dietitian experienced with bariatric surgery are essential. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food aversions</strong> &ndash; Food aversions may develop during the transition phase from liquids to soft foods to a full diet, especially if there is prolonged vomiting associated with eating. For patients who enjoyed food variety prior to the surgery, the loss of food variety can result in anger and frustration. These patients will often complain that they experience anxiety and fear when eating. Reassurance and empathy is essential to help the patient overcome food intolerances. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By six months, most patients are able to tolerate most foods and tend to eat three small meals, with or without the inclusion of planned snacks, per day. If vomiting persists or emerges, an evaluation should be performed for anatomical etiologies (eg, ulcer, stricture) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pregnancy. Such patients with food aversions may express &quot;buyer's remorse&quot; and may request extensive investigations for problems with the gastric pouch. Reassurance about the ability of the pouch to tolerate a wide variety of foods with time is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dumping syndrome</strong> &ndash; This may occur to varying degrees, but it usually results in nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, and possibly diarrhea soon after eating within the first few years after surgery. These symptoms intensify when highly refined foods with simple sugars (eg, sweets) are consumed, leading to feelings of weakness and extreme fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;, section on 'Dumping syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications#H8245417\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;, section on 'Dumping syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food intolerances</strong> &ndash; Food intolerances may develop, especially to red meat, and patients may choose a more vegetarian-based diet. However, fresh fruits and vegetables are generally well tolerated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin and mineral supplementation</strong> &ndash; Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery require lifelong vitamin and mineral supplementation. Laboratory testing of nutritional status, scheduled at regular intervals based on the bariatric procedure, is required to permit adjustments to the standard supplementation regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrient management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term diet recommendations &ndash; </strong>A well-balanced diet containing all of the essential nutrients is recommended for continued good health and weight maintenance. Resources that may help patients with developing a lifelong healthy postoperative diet include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"http://www.choosemyplate.gov/&amp;token=+nVJmPhZ7CoZ6P5TTscsQE1A6C1z46oKcQmDPakNLj4PEsVYKQKwZR6HpzTIaGyc&amp;TOPIC_ID=587\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">My Plate</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"http://dashdiet.org/&amp;token=SlRwd66W5x1hJxU3BiEfqVr0YNZZ303UNFilyjNccBE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=587\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">DASH Diet</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"http://www.vrg.org/&amp;token=EWbBpma+4bSbmkDemoNLZ/WENsmYI9Yw20L+tYWCW/g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=587\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Vegetarian Resource Group</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maintenance</strong> &ndash; Obesity is a chronic condition, and although surgery has a strong influence on hunger and satiety, non-hunger cues remain pervasive in today's environment. Patients should be advised that attending support groups and having at least an annual check-in with their registered dietitian, especially if some weight gain is experienced, may contribute to sustained weight loss. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62310070\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleeve gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) resects the greater curvature of the stomach including the fundus and promotes rapid gastric emptying, accelerated transit of nutrients into the duodenum and proximal intestine, and favorable changes to gut microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. SG also changes gut hormone signaling by reducing fasting and postprandial ghrelin and augmenting nutrient-stimulated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The mechanism of weight loss and resultant comorbidity improvement seen following SG may be related to gastric restriction or to neurohumoral changes observed following the procedure due to the gastric resection or some other unidentified factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Since food tolerances vary greatly among individuals who have RYGB or SG, most programs follow the same diet advancement and recommendations post-SG as for post-RYGB; close monitoring with a registered dietitian during the diet stage transitions can be helpful to patients experiencing food intolerances or who may be struggling to stay adequately hydrated.</p><p>Nutritional recommendations for macronutrients after SG are similar to those after RYGB, although exact needs are not clearly defined and may need to be individually assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food aversions</strong> &ndash; Following SG, patients may complain of acid reflux symptoms. Given the limited stomach volume, the decreased motility of food through the sleeve during the healing process, and the preservation of stomach acid, patients may experience acid reflux if they eat too fast or too much. Although reflux is a common complaint in the early postoperative period after SG, by six months most patients have learned how to avoid it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food intolerances</strong> &ndash; Food intolerances seem to be much less common after SG than after RYGB; however, as with the bypass, postoperative food intolerances <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aversions vary widely among patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin and mineral supplementation, long-term diet recommendations, and maintenance are the same as described for patients with an RYGB. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrient management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is much less commonly performed at most bariatric centers compared with before. Patients who have undergone LAGB will generally resume a normal diet soon after surgery since the initial band is placed deflated. Rarely, patients may experience vomiting before the band is filled, if solid foods are ingested in large boluses or without adequate chewing.</p><p>The first band tightening usually occurs around six weeks after surgery. With gradual band tightening, which occurs at four- to six-week intervals during the first one to two years after surgery, patients begin to feel satiety at smaller meal sizes and learn to chew food more thoroughly. </p><p>Common determinants for a band fill include assessment of level of hunger before meals, level of satiety after meals, amount of weight loss or gain, amount of food a patient is able to eat in one sitting, and if a patient is vomiting. A well-adjusted band, in combination with exercise and appropriate food choices, will initially lead to weight loss of approximately 1 to 2 lbs per week. Patients should be able to eat most solid foods; restriction should be just enough to allow smaller meals to cause and maintain satiety. </p><p>Aggressive tightening of the band may result in frequent vomiting, which may ultimately steer the patient to maladaptive eating behavior. Over time, significant dilation of the esophagus similar to that seen in achalasia can occur. Furthermore, patients with an overly tight band may give up eating healthy solid foods and progressively rely on soft or liquid foods (eg, milkshakes) or crunchy foods such as cookies or chips, which are better tolerated. Unfortunately, such foods tend to be calorie dense and nutrient poor and often do not provide adequate satiety, as they rapidly empty from the pouch. When this occurs, weight loss can be suboptimal, and patients become frustrated with their inability to eat substantial foods.</p><p>Removal of band fluid in a band that is too tight frequently allows patients to again eat healthy foods, and weight loss is often observed despite loosening of the band. If esophageal dilation is noted, a follow-up study should be obtained six to eight weeks later to confirm return of the esophagus to normal caliber. Persistence of nausea and vomiting after removal of fluid in the band may indicate band slippage or gastric prolapse and should be investigated aggressively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although micronutrient deficiencies are not commonly seen after LAGB, folate deficiency has been observed. Thus, folate should be routinely monitored, especially in women of childbearing age. Persistent vomiting in a band patient should be aggressively treated with band deflation and surgical intervention if necessary, in order to reduce the risk of acute thiamin deficiency or mechanical injury to the stomach or esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H7792436\" class=\"local\">'Folate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22237625\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin B1 (thiamine)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility and pregnancy after bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) with a duodenal switch <span class=\"nowrap\">(BPD/DS)</span> is the least commonly performed bariatric procedure and is associated with substantial malabsorption of macronutrients and micronutrients. </p><p>This malabsorption leads to diarrhea and risks for protein and calorie malnutrition in addition to severe deficiencies in micronutrients including fat-soluble vitamins. Again, vitamin and mineral laboratory evaluations should be performed annually for life. </p><p>Some of the common complaints following BPD&plusmn;DS include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dumping syndrome</strong> &ndash; This is rare after <span class=\"nowrap\">BPD/DS</span> since the pylorus remains intact.

While protein digestion is not impaired after RYGB, <span class=\"nowrap\">BPD/DS</span> patients are at risk of protein malnutrition because of the great degree of malabsorption; approximately 27 percent of protein is not absorbed at 24 to 36 months after BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The increased loss of endogenous nitrogen may play a significant role in the development of protein-energy malnutrition after the procedure. Protein intake of 1.5 to 2.0 g of <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/kg</span> ideal body weight per day may be required, making the average protein requirement per day approximately 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The addition of the duodenal switch procedure to the BPD has reduced protein malabsorption from 11 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Thus, early postoperative diet stages are based upon meeting essential nutrient needs and maintaining adequate hydration. However, as weight stabilizes, patients will begin to obtain the bulk of their energy needs from dietary sources.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Long-term diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early after bariatric surgery, patients use stored adipose tissue for energy needs. Thus, early postoperative diet stages are based upon meeting essential nutrient needs and maintaining adequate hydration. As weight stabilizes and patients are obtaining the bulk of their energy needs from dietary sources, the nutritional recommendations for macronutrients do not differ from those of the general population. (See <a href=\"#H1758557177\" class=\"local\">'Macronutrient management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is common for patients with obesity preparing for bariatric surgery to have at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency preoperatively. Thus, patients should undergo routine baseline presurgical screening for levels of thiamin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, folate, iron, vitamin D and calcium, fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, K), zinc, and copper. (See <a href=\"#H3614845622\" class=\"local\">'Presurgical screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After bariatric surgery, patients should undergo nutrient assessments every three to six months in the first year, and annually thereafter.

(See <a href=\"#H952676654\" class=\"local\">'Postsurgical screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent micronutrient deficiency, patients should receive daily vitamin and mineral supplementation determined by the bariatric procedure after bariatric surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114101 \">table 3</a>).
