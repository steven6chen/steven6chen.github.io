It is generally used in cases of life- or organ-threatening rheumatic diseases, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated systemic vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal or central nervous system involvement.</p><p>CYC is also associated with a variety of toxicities which should lead clinicians to consider less toxic alternative medications whenever possible. While much of our knowledge about the toxicity of CYC has been extrapolated from its use in oncology, there are important differences in dosing and duration of treatment when used to treat rheumatic diseases.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the mechanism of action and major toxicities associated with CYC use for the treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases. General principles of the use of CYC for rheumatic diseases as well as the pharmacology of the drug are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkylating agents exert their biologic activity via covalent binding and crosslinking of a variety of macromolecules including DNA, RNA, and proteins. DNA crosslinking, probably the most important biologic action of these drugs, impairs DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading either to cell death or to altered cellular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The degree of inhibition of immune function is dependent upon the dose and duration of therapy. Alkylating agents are cytotoxic. Absolute lymphopenia is frequently seen following their administration, with reductions in the number of B cells and T cells of both CD4+ and CD8+ types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The ratio of circulating T cells and B cells may also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alkylating agents share a number of potentially severe side effects including bone marrow suppression, increased susceptibility to infection, gonadal toxicity, teratogenicity, bladder toxicity, hyponatremia, and an increased risk of malignancy.</p><p>The cumulative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC) is a major risk factor for toxicity. Thus, strategies that reduce the cumulative dose and duration of exposure can minimize long-term risks. One such strategy is to use intermittent pulse CYC regimens rather than daily oral therapy, which can result in a 60 percent or greater decrease in the cumulative dose. Also, changing CYC for another less toxic medication after remission induction is achieved is another strategy to limit exposure. The following examples are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of sequential therapy for lupus nephritis, patients began with pulse CYC for six months, followed by random assignment to one of three different regimens: continued CYC, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By switching from CYC to another drug, the risk for infection decreased from 77 percent to 29 to 32 percent. Prolonged amenorrhea decreased from 32 percent to 6 to 8 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;, section on 'Cyclophosphamide'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the CYCAZAREM trial, a study of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), orally administered CYC (plus glucocorticoids) was given for three to six months for remission induction, and then patients were randomly assigned to discontinue CYC in favor of the less toxic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or to continue CYC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At 18 months, the numbers of disease flares in the two treatment groups did not differ, but those patients in the azathioprine group were spared months of CYC exposure, presumably incurring lower long-term risks of cancer, infertility, and other side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Because the daily and intermittent intravenous administrations of CYC are not therapeutically equivalent in some settings, the decision about the route of administration and duration of therapy, whenever possible, should be based upon data available for a specific disease.</p><p>In addition to the cumulative dose, the toxicity of CYC is also affected by genetic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, in one study of 62 patients with lupus nephritis, those treated with CYC who were either homozygous or heterozygous for the cytochrome P450 variant 2C19*2 demonstrated a significantly lower risk of ovarian failure (from 80 to 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonadal toxicity'</a> below). However, these genotypes also correlated with an increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. Assessment of cytochrome P450 variants is not performed routinely in clinical practice. These findings, however, emphasize the variability in susceptibility to the effects of alkylating agent therapy. They also underscore the importance of careful monitoring for adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Intermittent (pulse) cyclophosphamide'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most serious short-term side effects of CYC relates to the induction of cytopenias. Hematologic toxicity becomes more common with increasing doses and is also more likely to occur with a longer duration of use. Granulocytes are most likely to be affected first (sometimes within days to a few weeks of treatment), followed by the platelet count and hematocrit. The total white blood cell count, as well as either the absolute neutrophil or the lymphocyte lines, can be affected. The tendency of CYC to cause lymphopenia is enhanced by the concomitant use of high doses of glucocorticoids. In view of the demargination of neutrophils that occurs with high-dose glucocorticoids, a white blood cell count below <span class=\"nowrap\">4000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> is associated with substantial immunosuppression even if the absolute neutrophil count remains <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1500/mm<sup>3</sup></span>.</p><p>In order to detect impending and potentially dangerous bone marrow toxicity, patients treated with daily oral CYC should have complete blood counts checked approximately every two weeks for as long as they receive these medications. Suppression of the total white blood cell count is not an aim of treatment with daily oral CYC and should be avoided, with dose adjustments as the total white blood count begins to fall. Patients receiving intravenous pulse CYC, usually administered on a monthly basis, develop leukopenic nadirs in a predictable fashion 7 to 14 days after administration. Bone marrow recovery is usually evident by 21 days. Monitoring of blood counts during treatment with CYC is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Monitoring of intermittent CYC'</a>.)</p><p>Although it is easier in clinical practice to monitor white cell counts with intravenous administration of CYC given the predictable nadir, there does not seem to be a significant difference in the frequency of severe leukopenic events with oral versus intravenous administration. As an example, in a review of 212 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis treated with CYC, there was no significant difference in the number of severe leukopenic events (defined as white blood cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;2/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> among patients treated with oral versus intravenous CYC (5 versus 7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The CYCLOPS study, which compared oral with intravenous CYC for the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, found fewer episodes of neutropenia in the intravenous CYC arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, this lower rate of neutropenic events was not associated with fewer infectious complications of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CYC can predispose to bacterial, opportunistic, and viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. CYC increases the risk of infection by inducing bone marrow depression, resulting in neutropenia or lymphopenia, and by interfering with normal neutrophil and lymphocyte function even in the absence of count reductions.</p><p>Patients receiving CYC who are at particular risk for infection are those who become neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL)</span> and those who are treated concomitantly with high doses of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]. As an example, a study including 143 patients with SLE found that infection occurred in 45 percent of CYC-treated patients compared with 12 percent of those treated with glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Bacterial infections were the most common, followed by opportunistic infections and herpes zoster.</p><p>Major bacterial or fungal infections can occur in the absence of neutropenia. This has been estimated to occur in 5 to 21 percent of patients treated with CYC for GPA or lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9,11,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,14,18</a>]. Concomitant use of glucocorticoids is thought to be a major risk factor for infection in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Infection with&nbsp;<em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> is a known complication of treatment with CYC, particularly when administered in combination with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As a result, prophylaxis is indicated for almost all patients on CYC. Prophylactic therapy for <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>There is also substantially increased risk for herpes zoster infection with CYC treatment. The incidence of zoster in different trials of vasculitis and lupus has ranged from 8 to 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,18</a>]. In one large trial of GPA, most zoster events did not occur during the periods of most intensive immunosuppression but rather occurred after patients had discontinued CYC and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, suggesting the possibility of an immune reconstitution syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>CYC therapy is associated with increased susceptibility to infection with or reactivation of human papilloma virus (HPV) based on the observed incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women treated with CYC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The cumulative total CYC dose is an independent risk factor for ovarian toxicity, regardless of how the medication is administered.</p><p>The following data illustrate these points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of women treated for lupus nephritis, POF occurred in 12 percent of women younger than 26 years, 27 percent of those aged 26 to 30, and 62 percent of those older than 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Sustained amenorrhea did not occur in any of the 16 patients treated with pulse glucocorticoids alone, but did develop in 2 of 16 patients (13 percent) treated with seven monthly pulses of CYC and in 9 of 23 (39 percent) treated with 15 or more monthly pulses of CYC. Amenorrhea began within the first seven months in one-half of those affected and occurred more quickly in women older than 25.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report of 84 women who were menstruating prior to intravenous (IV) CYC administration for SLE or vasculitis also demonstrated the importance of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Chronic amenorrhea did not develop in any of the 22 women younger than 26 years of age but occurred 14 of the 20 women (70 percent) older than age 35.</p><p/><p>However, some women who are treated successfully with CYC are able to conceive and deliver healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/25,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,28</a>].

The outcomes of 16 pregnancies in these women included 10 healthy babies, three spontaneous miscarriages, and three pregnancy terminations (two for anomalies and one for an SLE flare).</p><p>Another study evaluated the impact of prior IV CYC exposure on pregnancy outcomes in 535 women with SLE in Saudi Arabia, and found that the rate of live birth was not significantly different among women with and without prior CYC exposure (68 percent and 71 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Despite having the same rate of active lupus nephritis during pregnancy in each group (around 30 percent), significantly more pregnancies were delivered preterm to women with prior CYC exposure (41 percent) than to women without prior CYC exposure (23 percent).</p><p>Because women may remain fertile during therapy with CYC, steps to avoid pregnancy during treatment are essential.

These infants had multiple abnormalities, including growth restriction, ear and facial abnormalities, absence of digits, and hypoplastic limbs. Of the six pregnancies that resulted in surviving children, at least three had severe developmental delay. One twin pregnancy with CYC exposure for acute lymphocytic leukemia resulted in two live infants who were small for dates and who required intubation after delivery. One of these infants recovered fully and developed normally.

In three large cohort studies including patients with GPA, the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis ranged from 12 to 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/53,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55,56</a>]. The patients included in these studies were exposed to cumulative doses ranging from 50 to 100 g. By contrast, newer CYC regimens have markedly reduced the cumulative CYC exposure, resulting in lower rates of hemorrhagic cystitis. A patient on six monthly doses of IV CYC at 1250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/month</span> for lupus nephritis will receive a total cumulative dose of 7.5 g. Nonetheless, patients who require multiple courses of therapy, particularly with oral CYC, may ultimately reach cumulative doses associated with a significant risk of bladder toxicity.</p><p>Few cases of hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported from clinical trials and case reports of patients treated with intermittent IV CYC for rheumatic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].
