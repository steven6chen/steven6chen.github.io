The goal of screening is to identify persons at increased risk of sustaining a low trauma fracture and who would benefit from intervention to minimize that risk.</p><p>Screening for fracture risk involves appropriate history, physical examination, standard biochemical and hematologic studies, and measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). The clinical history should include inquiring about possible secondary causes of bone loss, such as use of medications with potential adverse effects on bone health and family history of osteoporosis. Approaches to BMD screening vary from country to country, in part due to cost and questions regarding the efficacy of a broad population screening policy. The issues surrounding screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men are reviewed here. Controversies surrounding screening for osteoporosis in premenopausal women are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p>Detailed information about diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of osteoporosis is found elsewhere.

In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined osteoporosis based upon dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74190 \">table 1</a>). The relative risk of fracture increases as bone mineral density (BMD) decreases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'T-score'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The burden of suffering associated with osteoporosis is related to the increased incidence of fractures in individuals with low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration. Fragility fractures are defined as fractures that occur following a fall from standing height or less or with no trauma. Although the greatest relative risk of fracture is in individuals with osteoporosis, the absolute number of fractures in those with bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores in the low bone mass (osteopenia) range is the same or greater than in those with T-scores in the osteoporosis range. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of fracture risk'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There were an estimated nine million osteoporotic fractures worldwide in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some estimates predict a continued increase in the number of hip fractures over the next 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], in part due to aging and increased lifespan of the population. However, other epidemiologic studies suggest that age-standardized hip fracture rates have been decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. In one study from Finland, review of a national discharge registry revealed a decline in hip fracture rates between 1997 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Possible reasons for the decline include a healthier aging population; improved functional ability; increased body weight; and greater use of calcium, vitamin D, and pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF FRACTURE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for osteoporosis involves fracture risk assessment and measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Bone density'</a> below). We recommend assessing risk factors for fracture in all adults, especially postmenopausal women, men over 50 years, and in any individual who experiences a fragility or low-trauma fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7950392\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most fractures occur in women and men who do not have osteoporosis by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) criteria. Individuals with osteoporosis are at the highest relative risk of fracture, but there are more fractures in patients with low bone mass or osteopenia (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) because there are so many more patients in this category. Therefore, assessment of risk factors that are independent of BMD is important for fracture prediction. Validated risk factors that are independent of BMD include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term glucocorticoid therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low body weight (less than 58 kg [127 lb])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of hip fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess alcohol intake</p><p/><p>The most robust non-BMD risk factors are age and previous low trauma<strong> </strong>fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most of these risk factors are easily discernible from a routine history and physical examination; taken together, they are highly predictive of low bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and future hip fracture, even in the absence of BMD measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although clinical risk factors are predictive of bone density and fracture risk, they may not be as useful for predicting response to therapy for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factor screening instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several osteoporosis risk assessment instruments have been developed to improve the selection of women and men for measurement of BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, none of the tools were very specific, and most were not validated in other cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In 2008, an online Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2046\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a>) was developed to estimate the 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures combined (hip, spine, shoulder, or wrist) for an untreated woman or man using easily obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>) with or without information on BMD. FRAX has been validated in 40 cohorts (over one million patient-years). The technical aspects of FRAX are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a>.)</p><p>When combined with country-specific economic analyses, FRAX can provide guidance for both BMD testing (assessment threshold) and treatment (intervention threshold). In countries with limited or no access to DXA, the FRAX algorithm can potentially be used to identify individuals in whom measurement of BMD would influence management decisions. As an example, measurement of BMD may be indicated in those with an intermediate fracture probability, in whom the selective addition of BMD testing may result in intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast, in those with high fracture probability, intervention may be justified without BMD measurement. Country-specific economic analyses are required to develop assessment thresholds, ie, the fracture probability at which BMD testing is cost-effective. Until such economic analyses are available, we do not suggest using the FRAX algorithm to identify individuals for bone density testing.</p><p>The use of the FRAX algorithm to define intervention thresholds is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical application of fracture risk assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Candidates for therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H11555730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Candidates for therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical markers of bone remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biochemical markers that reflect the overall rates of bone resorption and formation are currently available clinically and have been used extensively in research to help understand the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and responses to therapy. The mean values of these markers are generally higher in patients with osteoporosis than in matched normal subjects, but there is substantial overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Measurement of these markers is not helpful in deciding for or against bone density measurements. However, markers can provide information about fracture risk beyond that available from measurements of BMD and could conceivably influence a decision for or against pharmacologic intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77540 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, most studies indicate that pharmacologic intervention will reduce fracture risk independent of the initial marker value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE DENSITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone density measurements are used in conjunction with fracture risk assessment for osteoporosis screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with increased risk of fracture, regardless of the technique used for measurement (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Methods of measurement of BMD'</a>). We suggest BMD testing (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) in all women 65 years of age and older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years of age with clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>). We suggest not performing routine testing in men. However, we do recommend measurement of BMD in men with clinical manifestations of low bone mass and in those with risk factors for fracture. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for BMD testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DXA is the most widely used method for measuring BMD because it gives very precise measurements at clinically relevant skeletal sites (ie, those with major clinical consequences when a fracture occurs). The major disadvantages of DXA are that the machine is large (not portable) and expensive and that it uses ionizing radiation, albeit in a very low dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that low bone density (DXA) at any site can predict osteoporotic fracture, although hip measurements are superior to spine in predicting hip as well as overall osteoporotic fracture. DXA and fracture prediction are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitative computerized tomography (QCT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>QCT measures volumetric bone density of the spine and hip and can analyze cortical and trabecular bone separately. This method is quite useful in clinical research and may be used in individual patients to follow therapeutic responses to therapy, where large changes may be observed. However, it is not recommended for screening, largely because the application of T-scores to predict the risk of fracture has not been validated with QCT. In addition, this method is more costly and results in greater exposure to radiation than DXA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Methods of measurement of BMD'</a>.)</p><p>New algorithms have been developed to repurpose CT scans obtained for other clinical reasons as a bone density screening tool; however, these algorithms have yet to be validated on a large scale for osteoporosis screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the relatively high cost and lack of portability of DXA, other techniques to measure peripheral sites have been developed. These include ultrasound, peripheral DXA (pDXA), radiograph absorptiometry, and peripheral QCT (pQCT) of the heel, radius, or hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of osteoporosis are based upon BMD measured by DXA and, therefore, do not apply to these other technologies. However, these technologies can be used to predict fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Methods of measurement of BMD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative heel ultrasound appears to be a good predictor of fractures in men and women and is at least as good as clinical risk factors for identifying patients at high risk for osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Quantitative ultrasonography (QUS)'</a>.)</p><p>However, a limitation of ultrasound is that it does not reliably exclude or confirm DXA-determined osteoporosis. A meta-analysis of 25 studies that evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of calcaneal ultrasound for identifying patients with DXA T-scores &le;-2.5 concluded that currently used ultrasound cutoff thresholds do not have sufficiently high sensitivity or specificity to definitively exclude or confirm DXA-diagnosed osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Another major limitation to using quantitative ultrasound as a screening tool is that the criteria for diagnosing osteoporosis and recommending treatment based upon ultrasound are not yet well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot reliably be used to follow patients who are treated for osteoporosis, because of limited precision and a slow rate of change of bone mass at peripheral sites. Thus, most individuals with a high-risk ultrasound finding will need a confirmatory DXA both to determine the need for treatment based upon well-established guidelines and as a baseline for monitoring therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis using ultrasound to determine which women need DXA did not show this approach to be more cost effective than a strategy using DXA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Thus, although ultrasound has some utility for fracture prediction, because of the inability to apply ultrasound and other peripheral measurements to current diagnostic and treatment standards and to monitor response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], we continue to recommend DXA for screening purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In regions without access to DXA, however, peripheral measurements using a validated technique (such as ultrasound) for fracture risk assessment is acceptable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal site to measure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For screening site of measurement, we suggest DXA of hip and spine. Measurement of the hip alone could be sufficient in older individuals. Although overall fracture risk can be predicted by measurement or estimation of BMD at many skeletal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], the risk for fracture at a particular skeletal site is best estimated by measuring BMD at that skeletal site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. As an example, hip BMD is superior to BMD measured at other skeletal sites in predicting hip fracture. Therefore, since hip fracture is often associated with significant morbidity and mortality compared with other fractures, DXA of the hip is generally regarded as the best site for diagnosis of osteoporosis. In contrast, the lumbar spine is often considered the best skeletal site to monitor because it has improved precision and can detect responses to therapy earlier than hip BMD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Skeletal site to measure'</a>.)</p><p>The best site to measure for osteoporosis screening is controversial. Measurements from different sites (spine, hip, forearm) are often discordant with regard to the WHO diagnostic classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. Thus, when measurements of different skeletal sites are performed, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is based upon the lowest T-score for BMD assessed at one of these sites. Measuring more than one site generally increases the number of individuals categorized as osteoporotic. A meta-analysis of several population-based cohort studies showed that there was no advantage in risk prediction when measuring multiple sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, assessment of multiple sites does not appear to improve fracture prediction.</p><p>Nevertheless, in younger, postmenopausal women with risk factors for fracture, we suggest DXA measurements of both the spine and hip because early menopause is associated with greater BMD loss at the spine than the hip. In addition, interference from osteophytes and vascular calcifications on the spine measurement is usually minimal in women less than 65 years of age. In contrast, spinal osteophytes are common in aging women and men, which interferes with the assessment of BMD at this site. In this setting, measurement of hip BMD alone could be sufficient.</p><p>However, if pharmacologic therapy is planned, measurement of spine BMD might be useful for monitoring response to therapy. In the presence of degenerative changes of the spine, BMD can be monitored at another skeletal site, such as the hip or radius, although the sensitivity for detecting changes at these locations is lower.</p><p>Some authorities have a somewhat different approach, using the hip as the preferred site for measuring BMD, regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/16,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for BMD testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several strategies for incorporating bone mineral density (BMD) measurements into osteoporosis screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These include screening all individuals over a certain age (when fracture risk increases), screening only those women and men over a certain age with clinical risk factors for fracture, or screening those with clinical risk factors who are close to an intervention threshold and in whom the selective addition of BMD testing may result in intervention.</p><p>We suggest BMD testing (DXA) in all women 65 years of age and older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years of age with clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>). This recommendation is based upon the findings of an increased incidence of fracture that occurs in conjunction with low BMD after age 65 years and clinical trial data demonstrating a reduction in fracture when these women are treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness of early detection'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of data supporting routine BMD testing in men above a certain age, we suggest not performing routine testing in men. However, we do recommend measurement of BMD in men with clinical manifestations of low bone mass, such as radiographic osteopenia, history of low trauma fractures, and loss of more than 1.5 inches in height, as well as in those with risk factors for fracture, such as long-term glucocorticoid therapy, androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, hypogonadism, primary hyperparathyroidism, and intestinal disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>).

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for screening men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. Other groups, such as the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), the Endocrine Society, and the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend BMD testing for all men older than 70 years, and the Canadian Osteoporosis Society recommends BMD testing for all men older than 65 years.</p><p>BMD screening recommendations for men and for women younger than 65 years also vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62866\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62866 \">table 3</a>). The USPSTF recommends BMD screening in women younger than 65 years whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors for fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. The USPSTF used the Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) algorithm to select a threshold above which bone density testing is recommended (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factor screening instruments'</a> above).

The goal of follow-up testing is to detect low bone density before a major fracture occurs. However, whether rate of BMD loss is an independent risk factor for fracture is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study using a database of all clinical BMD results from Manitoba, Canada, 146 women (mean age 65 years) sustained one or more osteoporotic fractures after the second BMD test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Compared with women who remained fracture free, women who fractured were older, had lower baseline (T-scores lumbar spine -1.0 versus -1.6 and femoral neck -1.2 versus -1.7, respectively) and final BMD, and a higher prevalence of other risk factors for fracture (ie, glucocorticoid use). However, the annualized percentage change in BMD did not differ in women who did and did not sustain major osteoporotic fractures.</p><p>In contrast, the Framingham Osteoporosis study, a population-based cohort study of 800 older men and women (mean age at baseline BMD test 74.8 years) who had two BMD tests and were followed for a median of 9.6 years, showed that the change in BMD of the femoral neck was associated with hip and major osteoporotic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, the change in BMD over a four-year interval provided little additional clinically valuable information beyond the baseline BMD.</p><p>Similarly, in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), a repeat BMD measurement performed a mean of eight years after the initial measurement did not improve the overall predictive value of hip, spine, or nonspine fracture risk in 4124 community dwelling women 65 years and older (mean age 72 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The mean initial T-score was -1.37. In a subsequent analysis from SOF, 4957 women (67 years and older) who did not have osteoporosis at baseline testing were followed for up to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The interval for 10 percent of participants to make the transition from normal BMD or osteopenia at baseline to osteoporosis (defined as a T-score -2.50 or lower) was estimated. For women with normal (T-score -1.0 or better) or slightly low (T-score -1.01 to -1.49) bone mass at baseline, the interval between baseline testing and the development of osteoporosis was approximately 17 years. For women with moderately low (T-score -1.50 to -1.99) or low (T-score -2.00 to -2.49) bone mass at baseline, the interval was 4.7 and 1.1 years, respectively. These data suggest that healthy women 65 years of age and older who have a screening bone density study and are found to have normal bone density or only slightly low bone mass do not require repeat testing for 17 years, whereas women found to have moderately low or low bone mass at baseline require follow-up bone density testing within one to five years. Note, however, that treatment thresholds (for example, based on absolute fracture risk) may differ from diagnostic thresholds (based on T-score of -2.5 or lower), and therefore, it is possible that some women with moderate or high absolute fracture risk may benefit from more frequent bone density testing to identify the proper timing for intervention.
