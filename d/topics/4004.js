DM, unlike PM, is associated with a variety of characteristic skin manifestations. A form of DM termed amyopathic DM (ADM, historically termed &quot;dermatomyositis sine myositis&quot;) is a condition in which patients have characteristic skin findings of DM without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes.</p><p>The clinical and serologic features of DM and PM vary among affected individuals and populations, depending upon immunogenetic and possibly other genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

There is a female to male predominance of about two to one. The peak incidence in adults occurs between the ages of 40 and 50, but individuals of any age may be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Estimates of prevalence range from 5 to 22 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The estimated annual incidence of the amyopathic subset of DM in the residents of Olmstead County in Minnesota was 0.2 per 100,000 persons in a study in which the annual incidence of DM of all types was approximately 1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17269403\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) are both multisystem disorders with a wide variety of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Most patients exhibit proximal skeletal muscle weakness. Several characteristic skin eruptions are typical of DM, and a subset of patients with typical cutaneous manifestations exhibit amyopathic DM (ADM), lacking evidence of muscle disease.</p><p>Interstitial pulmonary disease, dysphagia, and polyarthritis are also common in DM and PM, along with constitutional symptoms; Raynaud phenomenon is present in some patients. Features that overlap with other systemic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), may also be present. The risk of malignancy may be increased, particularly in patients with DM. Each of the major clinical features is described in the sections below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17269410\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle weakness is the most common feature of DM and PM; over 90 percent of patients with PM present with muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, cutaneous manifestations often precede or accompany weakness, which is found at presentation in only 50 to 60 percent of patients with DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Typically mild myalgias and muscle tenderness occur in 25 to 50 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H17269417\" class=\"local\">'Skin findings'</a> below.)</p><p>The distribution of weakness is characteristically symmetric and proximal in both PM and DM. Affected muscles typically include the deltoids and the hip flexors. Weakness of the neck flexors is also common. Distal muscle weakness, if present, tends to be mild and usually does not cause significant functional impairment. Rarely, patients present with focal myositis that usually but not always progresses to the typical generalized form over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients usually report a history of the insidious or subacute development of the muscle weakness, with gradual worsening over a period of several months before medical attention is sought. However, an acute onset of weakness is occasionally reported. Patients may describe increasing difficulty climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, carrying heavy groceries, or picking up their children due to the proximal muscle involvement. They may notice joint pain and swelling, if present, and they occasionally mistakenly ascribe weakness to the joint involvement. Pain is mild, if present, and stiffness is not a prominent complaint. (See <a href=\"#H17269459\" class=\"local\">'Antisynthetase syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17269473\" class=\"local\">'Overlap syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Muscle atrophy is generally not seen in early cases, even in patients with marked weakness, but it may occur in severe, longstanding disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17269417\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several distinct cutaneous eruptions, which are generally evident at the time of clinical presentation, occur in DM but not in PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Other skin changes may occur in patients with PM and in patients with DM and are not specific to either disorder. Dermatologic manifestations may be prominent but can be quite subtle in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358977889\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristic dermatomyositis findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gottron's papules and the heliotrope eruption are the hallmark and likely pathognomonic features of DM. Gottron's sign, photodistributed erythema, poikiloderma, nailfold changes, scalp involvement, and calcinosis cutis are also characteristic and useful in distinguishing DM from PM.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gottron's papules</strong> &ndash; Gottron's papules are erythematous to violaceous papules that occur symmetrically over the extensor (dorsal) aspects of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63383%7EDERM%2F89229%7ERHEUM%2F89230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63383 graphicRef89229 graphicRef89230 \">picture 1A-C</a>). In addition, these lesions may involve the skin between the MCP and IP joints, particularly when the eruption is prominent. Gottron's papules often have associated scale and may ulcerate. When scaling is present, the lesions may mimic psoriasis or lichen planus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gottron's sign</strong> &ndash; Definitions used for Gottron's sign have varied in the literature. We define Gottron's sign as the presence of erythematous to violaceous macules, patches, or papules on the extensor surfaces of joints in sites other than the hands, particularly the elbows, knees, or ankles. By contrast, some authors have used the term Gottron's papules to refer to papules in these areas, reserving Gottron's sign for macular or patch-like lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50909 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heliotrope eruption</strong> &ndash; The heliotrope eruption is an erythematous to violaceous eruption on the upper eyelids, sometimes accompanied by eyelid edema, which, at times, may be quite marked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89101%7ERHEUM%2F73090%7ERHEUM%2F53713%7EDERM%2F89102\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89101 graphicRef73090 graphicRef53713 graphicRef89102 \">picture 3A-D</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facial erythema</strong> &ndash; Patients may have midfacial erythema that can mimic the malar erythema seen in SLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89101%7EDERM%2F55875\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89101 graphicRef55875 \">picture 3A, 3E</a>). In contrast to those with SLE, patients with DM will often have involvement of the nasolabial fold, which can be helpful in distinguishing these two photosensitive midfacial eruptions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Photodistributed poikiloderma (including the shawl and V signs)</strong> &ndash; Poikiloderma refers to skin that demonstrates both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, as well as telangiectasias and epidermal atrophy. In DM, patients may demonstrate poikiloderma in any photo-exposed site; however, classic areas of involvement are the upper back (shawl sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89158%7EDERM%2F79924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89158 graphicRef79924 \">picture 4A-B</a>) and the V of the neck and upper chest. The poikiloderma in DM often presents with a violaceous hue. Early in the course of cutaneous disease, these areas may demonstrate only erythema rather than well-developed poikiloderma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54230 \">picture 5</a>). The erythema may be macular (nonpalpable) or papular. In rare patients, these lesions become thickened and resemble papular mucinosis. The cutaneous eruption of DM is often associated with significant pruritus, which may assist in distinguishing its photo-exacerbated eruption from that of lupus erythematosus (LE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Holster sign</strong> &ndash; Patients with DM may also have poikiloderma on the lateral aspects of the thighs, referred to as the &quot;Holster sign&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70041%7ERHEUM%2F89161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70041 graphicRef89161 \">picture 6A-B</a>). It is unclear why this cutaneous manifestation occurs on this classically photo-protected site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized erythroderma</strong> &ndash; In rare patients, erythroderma may occur, which involves extensive cutaneous surface area, including areas that are less exposed to ultraviolet light.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periungual abnormalities</strong> &ndash; The capillary nail beds in DM may be erythematous and may show vascular changes similar to those observed in other systemic rheumatic diseases (eg, scleroderma and SLE). Abnormal capillary nail bed loops may be evident, with alternating areas of dilatation and dropout and with periungual erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89162%7ERHEUM%2F89163\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89162 graphicRef89163 \">picture 7A-B</a>). In addition, cuticular overgrowth, sometimes termed &quot;ragged cuticles,&quot; is characteristic and may be associated with hemorrhagic infarcts within the hypertrophic area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89162\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89162 \">picture 7A</a>). The degree of cuticular involvement is thought to reflect ongoing cutaneous disease activity, representing active vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psoriasiform changes in scalp</strong> &ndash; Changes in the scalp resembling seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis occur in a high percentage of patients with DM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89164\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89164 \">picture 8</a>). The scalp involvement in DM is diffuse, often associated with poikilodermatous changes and with prominent scaling. Scalp involvement may result in severe burning, pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep disturbance. In addition, severe pruritus may occur in patients without visible disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcinosis cutis</strong> &ndash; The deposition of calcium within the skin, a finding known as calcinosis cutis, occurs commonly in juvenile DM. It is infrequent in adult DM. In children, calcinosis has been associated with a delay in treatment with glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive therapy. Calcinosis cutis, which is known to be very challenging to treat, may be seen in a variety of conditions, including SSc, particularly limited cutaneous SSc; SLE (rarely); and overlap connective tissue disorders. It may be more common in patients with DM with the <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-p140/anti-MJ</span> autoantibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Occasionally, these changes result in irregular, dirty-appearing horizontal lines that resemble those of a manual laborer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56057\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56057 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In addition, patients with MDA-5 antibodies are at a higher risk for interstitial lung disease (ILD), including a rapidly progressive presentation with high mortality. Recognizing the cutaneous features are thus imperative in order to allow the clinician to closely monitor the patient's pulmonary status, particularly in the absence of widely available autoantibody testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29881866\"><span class=\"h3\">Rare cutaneous findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely reported cutaneous findings in patients with DM have included ichthyosis, panniculitis, cutaneous vasculitis, lichen planus, porcelain white atrophic scars, vesicle and bullae formation, follicular hyperkeratosis, malakoplakia, papular mucinosis, and flagellate erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/15,16,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,23-25</a>]. Diffuse non-pitting edema is another rare manifestation of DM, and may be a marker of more aggressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17269424\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ILD is an important complication in at least 10 percent of cases of DM and PM. In DM, it can be observed in patients with either classic or amyopathic disease. In addition, respiratory insufficiency may result from diaphragmatic and chest wall muscle weakness. The occurrence of ILD may be associated with rapidly progressive pulmonary failure and death. ILD in the inflammatory myopathies often occurs in the context of antisynthetase antibodies and the antisynthetase syndrome. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

Most patients exhibit proximal skeletal muscle weakness and evidence of muscle inflammation, but the immune mechanisms and the anatomic focus of injury within the muscle tissue in DM and PM appear distinct. The muscle weakness usually develops in an insidious or subacute fashion, with gradual worsening over a period of several months. Muscle atrophy may be present in severe, longstanding disease. Oropharyngeal and upper esophageal muscle involvement may lead to dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, or aspiration. Respiratory failure may result from weakness of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. (See <a href=\"#H17269403\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269410\" class=\"local\">'Muscle weakness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269424\" class=\"local\">'Lung disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269438\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several characteristic skin eruptions are typical of DM, including Gottron's papules and the heliotrope eruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63383%7ERHEUM%2F89101\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63383 graphicRef89101 \">picture 1A, 3A</a>); these changes are considered pathognomonic for DM. Photodistributed erythema and poikiloderma, as well as nailfold changes, are also characteristic and useful in distinguishing DM from PM. A form of DM, termed amyopathic DM (ADM, historically known as &quot;dermatomyositis sine myositis&quot;), is a condition in which patients have characteristic skin findings of DM without weakness, abnormal muscle enzymes, or other abnormal muscle studies. (See <a href=\"#H17269403\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269417\" class=\"local\">'Skin findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269466\" class=\"local\">'Amyopathic dermatomyositis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may occur with DM (including ADM), PM, and overlap myositis. Dysphagia and polyarthritis are also common in DM and PM, along with constitutional symptoms; the Raynaud phenomenon is present in some patients. Features that overlap with other systemic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), may also be present. The risk of malignancy may be increased, particularly in patients with DM.

Muscle enzyme levels are useful in making the diagnosis and in following disease activity. Although CK-MB elevation is not unusual, a common source is skeletal muscle, and symptomatic cardiac muscle involvement is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H17269487\" class=\"local\">'Muscle enzymes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17269445\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies are found in a majority of patients. Among the myositis-specific autoantibodies, antibodies against aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetases, particularly anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1), have been associated with ILD, the Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis, and mechanic's hands, known collectively as the antisynthetase syndrome. Additional myositis-specific autoantibodies include other antisynthetase antibodies, anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, anti-Mi-2 antibodies, and others.
