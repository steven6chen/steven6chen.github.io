The choice of technique for uterine evacuation depends more upon uterine volume and operator experience than the underlying indication for the procedure.</p><p>Issues common to both first and second trimester pregnancy termination will be reviewed here. Techniques for first and second trimester procedures are discussed separately.

The highest rate was in the Caribbean (65 per 1000) and the lowest rate was in North America (17 per 1000) and Northern or Western Europe (18 per 1000). An estimated 25 percent of pregnancies worldwide ended in induced abortion. There are reports of increased numbers of requests for abortion in countries impacted by Zika virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The CDC figures are based upon data voluntarily reported to state health agencies and are incomplete. The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which surveys all known abortion providers, reported a rate of 19 abortions per 1000 women in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In the United States in 2008, there were 6.4 million pregnancies among 62 million women. Fifty percent of pregnancies were unintended and 19 percent of pregnancies resulted in pregnancy termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In England in 2010, there were 225,600 unintended pregnancies and 155,500 induced abortions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Abortion rates were highest in women ages 20 to 24 (30 per 1000 women) and 25 to 29 (22 per 1000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The rate of abortion in adolescents was 10.7 per 1000 women, with the highest rates for those ages 18 to 19 (21 to 26 per 1000) compared with 17 or younger (1 to 13 per 1000).</p><p>Most terminations were performed in women who were unmarried (84 percent) and had one or more children (59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The abortion rate among women living below the federal poverty level ($9570 for a single woman with no children in 2002) is more than four times that of women above 300 percent of the poverty level (44 versus 10 abortions per 1000 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Most abortions in the United States in 2008 were performed in non-Hispanic white (37 percent) or non-Hispanic black (36 percent) women. Abortion rates per 1000 women in a specific racial group are higher in non-Hispanic black (33.5 per 1000) and Hispanic women (20.6 per 1000) than in non-Hispanic white women (8.7).</p><p>The vast majority of pregnancy terminations were performed in the first trimester: 63 percent at &le;8 weeks and 91 percent at &le;13 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For later gestational ages, 7 percent of abortions were performed at 14 to 20 weeks of gestation and 1 percent at &ge;21 weeks. Adolescents and non-Hispanic black women were more likely than other women to undergo abortion at &ge;14 weeks. Potential barriers to early abortion include: expense, delay in recognition and confirmation of pregnancy, parental involvement laws, and lack of access to an abortion provider. Eighty-seven percent of all United States counties lacked an abortion provider in 2000; 34 percent of all United States women live in those counties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Repeat pregnancy terminations accounted for approximately 42 percent of all induced abortions in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For gestational ages &le;13 weeks, 76 percent of terminations were performed via vacuum aspiration and 15 percent were medication abortions (use of medication abortions greatly increased from 3 percent in 2001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For gestational ages of &ge;14 weeks, 9 percent were performed via vacuum aspiration and 0.1 percent via intrauterine instillation.</p><p>The most common reasons given for choosing abortion are that having a baby would interfere with work, school, or other responsibilities; inability to afford a child; not wanting to be a single parent; and having problems with a husband or partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy terminations can be performed safely in freestanding clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and in an office setting with proper equipment for performing in-office surgical procedures.

A nondirective discussion of alternatives (eg, continuing pregnancy, adoption) is extremely important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A signed informed consent should be obtained from all patients.</p><p>Some states have mandatory waiting times between when the patient is counseled and the actual procedure, some states require parental notification or consent for abortions in minors (minors have the right to seek a court order authorizing the procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], while others mandate that specific topics be covered in the counseling session.

In this topic, the gestational age refers to the date from the first day of the last menstrual period. The gestational age guides choices regarding the type of procedure, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication versus aspiration abortion &ndash; The efficacy of medication abortion using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is well established up to 49 days of gestation. In selected cases, <span class=\"nowrap\">mifepristone/misoprostol</span> abortion is performed at up to 63 days of gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester medication abortion (termination of pregnancy)&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of surgical evacuation versus suction curettage &ndash; Suction curettage can typically evacuate pregnancies up to 14 weeks of gestation.

However, use of menstrual dating (if the patient is certain of the date of her last period and has regular menses) confirmed by pelvic examination is acceptable in the first trimester. The clinical policy guidelines of the National Abortion Federation (NAF), a professional organization of abortion providers in the United States, do not mandate ultrasound preceding abortion in the first trimester since doing so is not always necessary or even helpful and might impede access to abortion in underserved regions where ultrasound is unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Providers should obtain ultrasound, however, prior to second trimester aspiration abortion.</p><p>When menstrual dating is used, the date is estimated based upon the interval from the last menstrual period and a bimanual pelvic examination is performed to assess the uterine size. Ultrasound examination should be performed if the patient is uncertain of her dates, has irregular periods, uterine size is inconsistent with menstrual dating, or uterine size cannot be adequately assessed (eg, due to obesity). Unfortunately, physical examination is misleading in many cases. As an example, one study compared dating by pelvic examination with ultrasound and found that, even in the first trimester, pelvic examination dating differed by more than two weeks in 10 percent of cases for senior gynecologists and nearly 25 percent for junior clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Measurement of fetal parts following abortion can potentially further corroborate gestational age assignment. Several formulae exist to help providers extrapolate gestational age from fetal foot length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64496\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64496 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While post hoc documentation of gestational age from fetal measurements might serve medicolegal purposes if gestational age is subsequently called into question, it offers no clinical or surgical value.</p><p>Assessment of gestational age is discussed in detail separately.

Others give perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and omit screening in low risk women or screen at the time of the procedure and subsequently treat positive results as appropriate. Screening guidelines for selecting individuals at increased risk of having sexually transmitted infections can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative ultrasonography should be considered if there is a discrepancy between uterine size and gestational age, uncertain fetal viability, or the diagnosis is in doubt (possible ectopic pregnancy or hydatidiform mole). It is also important, at advanced gestational ages, to insure that the procedure is in accordance with state and federal law. Indeed, recent laws and court rulings have led some providers to perform feticidal procedures prior to uterine evacuations so as to ensure that the procedures do not violate any laws concerning later-in-gestation pregnancy terminations.</p><p>Concurrent intraoperative ultrasonography should be arranged in cases of abnormal cervicouterine architecture (eg, uterine anomaly or fibroids, cervical constriction) or abnormal intrauterine contents (eg, hydatidiform mole).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is given for aspiration abortion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Postabortal endometritis occurs in 5 to 20 percent of women not given antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials found prophylactic antibiotics significantly decreased of the risk of periabortal endometritis in all subgroups of women undergoing induced abortion, even women at low risk (ie, no history of pelvic inflammatory disease and a negative preoperative chlamydia culture) (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.47-0.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sequelae of postabortal infection include infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain.</p><p>Use of prophylactic antibiotics for medication abortion is controversial. The rate of infection following medication abortion is low. However, some cases of serious infection do occur, including rare cases of clostridial sepsis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for medication abortion is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy#H16672499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester medication abortion (termination of pregnancy)&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dilation of the cervix to allow insertion of instruments and removal of the products of conception is usually necessary prior to uterine aspiration. This can be accomplished mechanically using osmotic dilators (eg, laminaria) or rigid dilators, or by using pharmacological agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]). A combination of methods may be needed, although any cervical preparation will likely facilitate the uterine evacuation procedure and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure.</p><p>Adequate cervical preparation can help minimize the occurrence of procedure-related complications, such as cervical laceration and uterine perforation. Risk factors for complications during dilation include: cervical stenosis, uterine anomalies, severe uterine flexion, adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], advanced gestational age, provider inexperience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], and, possibly, parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Rigid dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigid dilation is performed using instrument sets with progressively increasing diameters. Tapered Pratt or Denniston (a plastic equivalent of Pratt) dilators are preferred over blunt Hern or Hegar dilators, which require a greater use of force (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82709%7EOBGYN%2F74741\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82709 graphicRef74741 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mechanical dilation is believed to be more traumatic to the cervix than other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Cervical dilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Osmotic dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osmotic dilators (natural: seaweed Laminaria japonica; synthetic: Dilapan-S) absorb cervical moisture, gradually enlarging the endocervical canal and softening the cervix. Osmotic dilator-induced cervical change also results from the release of endogenous prostaglandins, which further soften the cervix and facilitate the dilation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Use of osmotic dilators helps prevent cervical injury and may also decrease the risk of uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/20,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,27</a>]. A large cohort study of 15,000 first trimester abortions observed that use of laminaria significantly reduced risk of cervical injury compared to rigid dilators (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.52) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a subsequent larger cohort study (67,175 first trimester abortions), the same authors noted use of laminaria also reduced the risk of uterine perforation, but the result was not statistically significant (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-1.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Use of osmotic dilators is not associated with an increased risk of postabortal infection. Randomized trials that compared use of laminaria to rigid dilation or to Dilapan did not find significant difference in postabortal infection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Nevertheless, bacterial contamination is possible because laminaria are produced from seaweed, and sterilization techniques may not be 100 percent effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>In rare cases, a patient may have a hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to laminaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This is likely IgE-mediated due to previous exposure to laminaria during an abortion or other gynecologic procedures.</p><p>Unlike manual dilation, which is performed immediately before evacuation, osmotic dilators must be placed several hours prior to the procedure to give them time to effect cervical change. The synthetic dilators are more expensive than laminaria, but work more quickly and therefore may be more useful for same-day procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69543 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to use laminaria &ndash; Proper use of laminaria tents requires that they be inserted and left in place for 12 to 18 hours to achieve optimal cervical dilation (women can be sent home following insertion of the laminaria tents), although they can be removed earlier, after six hours, often with sufficient dilation.</p><p/><p>Insertion of a large number of small diameter laminaria (2 or 3 mm) is preferable to using a few large ones (6 mm) because placement is easier and there is better cervical dilation. Some post-insertion cramping is common; a paracervical block or other analgesic approach may be required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64237 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The laminaria are kept in place with two 4 by 4 gauze sponges tucked into the fornices and the number of laminaria inserted recorded in the woman's chart. She should avoid intercourse and return to the office when instructed or if she develops bleeding, rupture of membranes, or fever. Failure to remove the laminaria within 48 hours of placement can result in severe infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostaglandin E1 analogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> can also be used for preoperative cervical ripening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-40</a>]. Prostaglandin analogues are equivalent to osmotic dilators in reducing the amount of force needed for cervical dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]; comparative studies are need to evaluate whether they decrease the incidence of major immediate complications, such as uterine perforation and cervical laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A dose of 400 mcg per vagina two to three hours prior to the procedure was recommended in a study attempting to determine optimal dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], administration only one hour before termination was not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The 400 mcg dose is equivalent to placement of one medium laminaria for four hours, but causes less patient discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In Europe, the PGE1 analog gemeprost (1 mg per vaginam three hours before surgery) is commonly used for cervical ripening, but this drug is not available in the United States.</p><p>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> was used in first trimester procedures, 97 percent of patients had cervical dilation of at least 8 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, in second trimester procedures at 13 to 16 weeks of gestation, same day misoprostol was not as effective as laminaria placed the day before the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A randomized trial comparing these two techniques found that use of laminaria resulted in greater mean initial dilation (43 versus 33 French [each French unit equals 0.33 mm in diameter]), less need for additional dilation (21 versus 80 percent of patients), and faster procedure times in nulliparous women (3.4 versus 9.5 minutes).

Any physical or sonographic evidence of retained products of conception should prompt consideration of suction curettage to complete evacuation of the uterus. In the absence of detectable retained material, a presumptive diagnosis of endometritis may be made and treated with a trial of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, with coverage of anaerobes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a> [2 g intravenously] plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> [100 mg intravenously or orally] every 12 hours).

All women will continue to have an elevated level of hCG for a short period following pregnancy termination. Return of the serum hCG concentration to undetectable following pregnancy termination varies widely from 7 to 60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The period of time depends primarily upon the hCG concentration at the time of termination. The hCG concentration peaks at 8 to 11 weeks at approximately 90,000 mIU. This is in contrast with term pregnancy, for which the hCG concentration is lower. The decline in serum hCG is rapid for the first several days (half-life 9 to 31 hours) and then proceeds more slowly (half-life 55 to 64 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].

A second series reported an ongoing pregnancy rate of 1.3 per 1000 procedures for pregnancies less than 6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>The type and risk of possible damage to the ongoing pregnancy from an attempted abortion cannot be quantified. Direct or indirect injury to the developing embryo could occur. One preliminary report suggested there may be an increased risk of Moebius sequence with autism in children exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Moebius sequence is a clinical condition characterized by ophthalmic-facial palsy and muscle or bone malformations in the limbs. It represents a cascade of events resulting from embryo trauma from varied etiologies (eg, genetic factors, environmental injuries, prolonged membrane ruptures and chorion villus sampling). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-as-a-single-agent-for-medical-termination-of-pregnancy#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Misoprostol as a single agent for medical termination of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Teratogenicity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Future pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conflicting results have been reported from studies evaluating whether prior induced abortion is a risk factor for preterm delivery in a subsequent pregnancy. A review of ten studies of the long-term impact of vacuum aspiration for first trimester induced abortion found that women whose first pregnancy ended in induced abortion had no greater risk of bearing low birth weight babies, delivering prematurely, or suffering spontaneous abortions in subsequent pregnancies than women who carried their first pregnancy to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. Pregnancy termination did not have the same salutatory effects on the following pregnancy (eg, shorter labor, lower rate of preeclampsia) as a full term normal pregnancy. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of 37 studies reported that women with versus without a history of pregnancy termination had a significantly increased risk of low birth weight infants (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) and preterm delivery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5), but not infants who were small for gestational age (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7-1.1) in subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>The only two series addressing future pregnancy in women who have undergone a prior second trimester evacuation procedure using laminaria did not report any cases of spontaneous midtrimester loss nor an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. However, other studies have suggested abortion may increase the risk of subsequent preterm birth. All of these retrospective studies are flawed because they are subject to recall bias and inadequate adjustment of other risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, sexually transmitted disease, smoking). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'History of abortion'</a>.)</p><p>The possibility of a link between induced abortion and subsequent placental problems has also been studied. A report of all primigravid women delivering in Denmark from 1980 to 1982 used data from the Danish Birth, Hospital Discharge, and Induced Abortion Registries to compare the risk of placental complications in subsequent pregnancy among 15,727 women who underwent first trimester termination and 46,026 women did not have a termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. There was no difference in the risk of placenta previa, but women with a previous termination had a slightly higher rate of retained placenta (OR 1.17, 95 percent CI 1.02 to 1.35).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) meta-analysis included individual data from 83,000 women in 16 countries in 53 studies and reported that the risk of breast cancer was not increased in women with a history of induced abortion (relative risk 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Other studies published have confirmed this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-104</a>]. In contrast, a meta-analysis of 36 comparative studies in China found that a history of induced abortion was associated with a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.29-1.59) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraception should be discussed prior to and reviewed immediately after the termination. Ovulation can occur two weeks after a first trimester abortion, thus immediate contraception is important (if desired) and can be initiated the day of the procedure. A full discussion of post-termination contraception can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy symptoms generally should have dissipated within one week of the pregnancy termination and normal menses should return within six weeks. The absence of these findings could suggest ongoing intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy or incomplete abortion.</p><p>A routine follow-up visit two to four weeks after the procedure is intended to confirm that the abortion is complete and to diagnose and treat complications. In addition, general reproductive health care (eg, contraceptive plans, cervical cytology) may be performed if not initiated preoperatively or at the time of the pregnancy termination. However, there is no evidence that routine in-person follow-up after first trimester abortion is necessary to detect conditions that the women themselves could not be taught to recognize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Telephone follow-up 24 to 48 hours after the procedure and patient education about signs of incomplete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and infection may be adequate, with more intensive follow-up of higher risk patients (eg, uterine anomaly, psychosexual issues) and those with second trimester procedures.</p><p>Fever, pelvic pain, uterine enlargement, heavy bleeding, passage of tissue, and on-going pregnancy symptoms require further evaluation. After induced abortion, hCG is detectable for as long as 60 days, with a median of 30 days after uterine evacuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/86,106-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,106-109</a>]; therefore, the presence of hCG is not generally useful for diagnosis of incomplete abortion and should not be ordered for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN'S FEELINGS AFTER PREGNANCY TERMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common emotional reactions after pregnancy termination are relief, transient guilt, sadness, and a sense of loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. There is no good evidence from large surveys that choosing to terminate an unwanted first pregnancy places a woman at higher risk of subsequent depression than choosing to deliver an unwanted first pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. The frequency of psychiatric diagnoses in women who have undergone an abortion procedure is similar to that in women with no such history.</p><p>Risk factors for postabortal psychosocial problems include previous or concurrent psychiatric illness, coercion, medical indications that force the patient to choose between possible life---threatening complications and termination of a wanted pregnancy, increasing length of gestation, ambivalence, and lack of social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pregnancy-termination/abstract/112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-114</a>]. In 1993, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised (DSM-IV-R) ceased to recognize abortion as a type of psychosocial stressor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3135901911\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Use of prophylactic antibiotics for medication abortion is controversial. The rate of infection following medication abortion is low, but some cases of serious infection do occur.
