The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, although it can be triggered by a viral infection or other immune trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely-recognized acronym &quot;ITP,&quot; and acknowledges the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder, while allowing that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of newly diagnosed and persistent ITP in children will be reviewed here.

There is no standard approach regarding the specific types of activity to restrict, and there is substantial variation in clinical practice. These decisions should be individualized and made in collaboration with the patient and family. In our practice, we suggest that children with platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL</span> avoid contact and collision sports (eg, football, boxing, lacrosse, and hockey), and also consider restricting other activities that have substantial risk for traumatic injury (eg, baseball, soccer, skiing, or gymnastics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reducing the risk for head injury is particularly important; this risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by the use of protective helmets. For soccer, we recommend that children avoid &quot;heading&quot; the ball with their feet on the ground, to reduce the force delivered to the head by the ball. The emphasis is on prevention of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), but the risk of severe abdominal trauma can also be reduced with these activity restrictions. The patient and family's values and preferences about the activity restriction often inform decisions about pharmacologic intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications</strong> &ndash; Antiplatelet medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enoxaparin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a>, novel oral anticoagulants) generally should be avoided. In our experience, the risk of clinically significant bleeding with ibuprofen is very low; however, because there is potential for more severe bleeding with its use, we advise not using it unless it is truly necessary. If these medications are necessary, then pharmacologic treatment of the ITP may be warranted to increase the platelet count to a safe level (usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30,000/microL;</span> higher levels may be necessary in some cases depending on other risk factors). If a child requires anti-inflammatory therapy (eg, for fever, pain, or arthritis not adequately controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>), other agents can be tried such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">celecoxib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choline-magnesium-trisalicylate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">choline magnesium trisalicylate</a>. Other measures for pain not adequately controlled with acetaminophen include nonpharmacologic measures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opioids as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Control of menses</strong> &ndash; For postmenarchal female patients, hormonal therapy (typically with a progesterone-based treatment) may be warranted to control or inhibit menses and prevent severe menorrhagia. Antifibrinolytics may also be of use. These therapies are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease#H55528403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease&quot;, section on 'Adjunctive therapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> &ndash; All patients should have ongoing monitoring for development of bleeding symptoms and regular measurements of platelet count, the frequency of which depends on the degree of thrombocytopenia, bleeding symptoms, and other risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H2682693177\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; Educating the child and caregivers about the risks of ITP is an important aspect of management. In addition to reviewing the activity and medication restrictions discussed above, patients and caregivers should receive education regarding symptoms of severe bleeding (eg, severe headache, hematuria, melena, heavy menstrual bleeding) and should be advised to consult their clinician if bleeding occurs. (See <a href=\"#H6631014\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1631354833\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2080555262\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of children with newly diagnosed ITP is based upon the severity of bleeding symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89047 \">table 1</a>), the degree of thrombocytopenia, and additional risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115184\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115184 \">algorithm 1</a>). Depending on individual patient characteristics, appropriate initial management may be either &quot;watchful waiting&quot; or pharmacologic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. The majority of children with ITP can be managed in the ambulatory setting if there are no severe bleeding complications (ie, cutaneous hemorrhagic manifestations only).</p><p>Data are limited in pediatric patients and indications for treatment are not standardized. Treatment decisions incorporate multiple considerations including the patient's presenting characteristics, particularly the degree of bleeding and platelet count; comorbid conditions and concomitant medications; patient values and preferences, including lifestyle and activities; and the provider's experience with the various pharmacologic options.</p><p>The following suggestions are based on the available evidence, expert opinion, and common practice. Many of these considerations are reflected in an international consensus report and guidelines published by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1091048630\"><span class=\"h3\">Life-threatening bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If life-threatening hemorrhage occurs (ICH, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding with hemodynamic instability, pulmonary hemorrhage with cardiopulmonary compromise), immediate intervention is required. We recommend that such patients be treated with a combination of <strong>all</strong> of the following combination of therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet transfusions &ndash; Platelet transfusions (at a dose of 10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> generally followed by a continuous infusion). Platelet count should be assessed immediately following the bolus (ie, 10 to 20 minutes after). Frequent sequential testing thereafter is important to ensure that the patient maintains a hemostatic platelet count and to guide additional therapy. Patients with ITP require larger-than-normal doses of platelets in transfusion due to rapid destruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methylprednisolone- <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methylprednisolone</a> is given at a dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (up to 1 g) intravenously (IV) for three to four days. (See <a href=\"#H3474618459\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) &ndash; IVIG is given at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day for one to three days (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'IVIG'</a> below). Anti-D immune globulin (anti-D) can be added to the regimen in Rhesus (Rh)-positive, direct antiglobulin test [DAT]-negative patients; however, the additional benefit of this agent in this setting is uncertain, and practice varies. Anti-D is administered at a dose of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg</span> IV as a single dose. We believe that IV anti-D can be a useful part of combination therapy, even in splenectomized patients despite its relative lack of efficacy when used as the sole agent in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Anti-D should not be given if the patient's DAT status is unknown, which is often the case in emergency situations. However, DAT testing is usually resulted quickly so that once the DAT status is confirmed to be negative, anti-D can be given at the end of the IVIG infusion. (See <a href=\"#H1954900885\" class=\"local\">'Anti-D immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In addition, we often administer a high dose of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>, since the acutely ill patient may not tolerate oral medications). Though this agent has little impact on the acute bleeding event (there typically is a five- to seven-day delay before a response is seen), it may boost and prolong the platelet response in the days following the bleeding event which may reduce the risk of re-bleeding. This practice is not standardized and other experts may chose not to use romiplostim in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-management-of-chronic-disease#H55529121\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease&quot;, section on 'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p>Combination treatment is more effective in immediately raising the platelet count than any one of these treatments alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A more limited version of these four treatments may be used if there is a risk of such an event (eg, head trauma without evidence of ICH; unexplained headache; or GI, genitourinary, or gynecological bleeding that is heavy, but not such as to create a risk of immediate loss of life). (See <a href=\"#H3637743185\" class=\"local\">'Severe non-life-threatening bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional interventions that have been used in patients with life-threatening bleeding but for which strong evidence is lacking include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viia-activated-recombinant-human-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Recombinant human factor VIIa</a>.

Splenectomy may be challenging to perform in patients with active hemorrhage, who are inherently unstable, and should be performed by an experienced surgeon. The time required to arrange splenectomy may reduce the desired (urgent) effect. In one series describing 40 children with ITP who suffered an ICH, splenectomized patients had worse outcomes, but this was likely due to selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, platelet transfusions may be necessary for patients with non-life-threatening bleeding who do not achieve an adequate response with other treatments (eg, if the response is too slow or if the platelet count does not increase to an acceptable level) and those who require surgery. If platelet transfusions are used for any surgery other than splenectomy for ITP, one or more other therapies of ITP as described below should be instituted to further support the patient's postoperative platelet count, since the transfused platelets would likely have a short half-life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination therapy &ndash; Rather than giving all three agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>, IVIG, and IV anti-D) for up to four days, a measured approach using only one or two of these agents for fewer days may be sufficient. The choice of agents can be guided by the patient's previous treatment response, if such experience exists. The choice and duration of therapy also depends upon the response to treatment (ie, amelioration of bleeding and rise in platelet count).</p><p/><p>As with life-threatening bleeding, we often administer a dose of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>) to increase the likelihood of a higher platelet response. This practice is based on clinical experience and indirect evidence from other settings (eg, chronic ITP).

The choice of initial treatment depends on how rapid an increase in platelet count is desired:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid rise in platelet count is desired</strong> &ndash; When a rapid rise in platelet count is desired (eg, planned surgery or procedure that is likely to induce blood loss, head trauma without ICH, severe unexplained headache), we suggest treatment with IVIG or anti-D (the latter is used only in Rh-positive, DAT-negative, non-splenectomized patients without evidence of hemolysis).

Potential but unproven benefits of this approach include relaxing restrictions on activity, improving quality of life, and preventing sequelae from bleeding; however, these must be weighed against the risks of side effects from ITP medications.

Glucocorticoids are generally less costly; however, the cost differential is less when initial and retreatment costs are combined and also depends upon whether hospitalization is part of the management plan. Also, some providers routinely perform a bone marrow examination before treating with glucocorticoids (though it is not our practice to routinely do so), which further increases the burdens and costs of that treatment pathway.

Although most patients respond to glucocorticoids, a drop in platelet count after the steroids are discontinued is common, unless spontaneous remission has occurred in the interim. Repeated courses of treatment may be necessary if significant hemorrhagic symptoms persist or recur, but prolonged use of glucocorticoids will almost inevitably result in substantial toxicity.

The risk of adverse reactions generally correlates with the dose of IVIG and the rate of infusion. Headache is the most common side effect (30 to 70 percent depending on a number of factors including brand), and is often delayed. Other common side effects included fatigue, abdominal pain, and myalgia. In some cases, very severe headaches may occur as a result of aseptic meningitis.

If there is an effect, it appears to be weak. In a preliminary report of a clinical trial that randomized 200 children with ITP to early treatment with a single dose of IVIG or careful observation with treatment only in the case of severe bleeding, the rate of progression to chronic ITP was similar in both groups (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Limited evidence suggests that treatment with IVIG compared with other therapies may be associated with a slightly lower likelihood of developing chronic ITP. In a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials, chronic ITP was less likely among patients treated with IVIG compared with steroids (18 versus 25 percent, respectively; relative risk [RR]. 71, 95% CI 0.52-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another meta-analysis of 54 observational studies, treatment with IVIG alone (but not in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>) was associated with a lower likelihood of developing chronic ITP (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective study from the Integrated Clinical Information System (ICIS) registry reported that children with acute ITP who were treated with IVIG were more likely to have a normal platelet count six months after diagnosis than those who did not receive IVIG (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.25-2.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Another registry study found that treatment with IVIG and glucocorticoids in combination was associated with increased likelihood of achieving remission at 12 months compared with no treatment (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective study from the five Nordic countries suggested that early treatment (which included IVIG in &gt;90 percent of cases) had no effect on subsequent development of chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Based on the available evidence, treatment should be directed at control of symptoms (ie, stopping severe hemorrhage, minimizing the risk of bleeding, and improving quality of life) rather than preventing development of chronic ITP.

Whether pharmacologic therapy reduces the risk of ICH and other life-threatening complications of ITP remains unproven. Large prospective trials would be necessary to answer this question, but this is not feasible, given the rarity of severe bleeding events. Indirect evidence that treatment may impact bleeding complications comes from the observation that bleeding risk appears to be related to the degree and persistence of thrombocytopenia and that the majority of patients who are treated respond with an increase in their platelet counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-initial-management/abstract/7,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,18</a>].

Anti-D can be added to the regimen in Rhesus (Rh)-positive, direct antiglobulin test [DAT]-negative patients; however, the additional benefit of anti-D in this setting is uncertain and practice varies. In addition, in our practice, we often administer a high dose of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romiplostim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romiplostim</a>).
