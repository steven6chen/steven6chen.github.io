During surgical procedures, the function of a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) may be affected by EMI, most commonly due to use of an electrosurgery unit (ESU). CIEDs with unipolar sensing<em> </em>configuration<em> </em>are more susceptible to EMI than those with bipolar sensing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1767270430\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks of electromagnetic interference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMI may cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of pacing due to ventricular oversensing of EMI. All CIEDs sense intracardiac signals (R <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> P waves) delivered through the electrodes. Oversensing leads to under-pacing when a device senses electrical signals that should be ignored (eg, myopotentials, T waves, artifact from a monopolar ESU). Oversensing leads to under-pacing when a device senses electrical signals that should be ignored (eg, myopotentials, T waves, artifact from a monopolar ESU), and interprets these signals as native R waves. Since these signals are interpreted by the device as R waves, no pacing is generated. This may result in profound bradycardia or asystole in a pacing-dependent patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105461\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef105461 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misinterpretation of EMI as a tachyarrhythmia, resulting in delivery of inappropriate shock(s) or antitachycardia pacing by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

The sensor may be a mechanical sensor (eg, an accelerometer) or a physiologic sensor (eg, a minute ventilation sensor that increases heart rate when respiratory rate increases), or a combination of the two. Such sensors are used in some patients to temporarily increase the pacing rate to compensate for increased physiologic need during exercise. Physiologic sensors are more susceptible to the effects of EMI than are mechanical sensors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of &quot;power on reset&quot; mode, causing the device to revert to its factory-programmed parameters. In an ICD, these parameters include a lower heart rate for initial treatment of ventricular arrhythmias and maximal energy shocks, as well as single-chamber (ventricular only; VVI) pacing at a rate of 60 to 72.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (bpm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a PM, these parameters would include ventricular-only pacing at a rate of 60 to 72.5 bpm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These settings are not optimal for many patients and may be dangerous for some.

When EMI is likely to occur for a pacing-dependent patient with an older device, an alternate pacing modality (eg, transvenous, transcutaneous, transesophageal) should be employed or be readily available as a backup. Of these backup options, transvenous pacing is the most reliable.</p><p/><p>An implantable loop recorder (ILR) is an electronic device designed to monitor cardiac rhythm and record pauses, bradycardia, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105462\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105462 \">image 1</a>). Since an ILR delivers no therapy, EMI is unlikely to cause patient harm. However, preoperative interrogation of the device is necessary because all recorded data may be lost during exposure to monopolar ESU or other strong EMI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H707922869\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of electromagnetic and other interference</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>EMI caused by ESUs</strong> &ndash; During surgery, EMI is most commonly generated by an ESU. Monopolar electrosurgery is much more likely to cause EMI than bipolar electrosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The coagulation (high voltage) mode causes more EMI than the non-blended cutting (low voltage) mode.

In most patients, this can be accomplished by accessing the results of a recent interrogation of the CIED. The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) recommends interrogation prior to scheduled surgery as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within six months for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within 12 months for a conventional pacemaker (PM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within three to six months for any cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device</p><p/><p>This step is critical since subsequent steps for intraoperative management might be ineffective in a malfunctioning device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4179673442\"><span class=\"h2\">Planning device management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key management issues determined during the preoperative evaluation by the CIED care team include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105464 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-management-of-patients-with-a-pacemaker-or-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/6-9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is the patient pacing-dependent? </strong>&ndash; Patients with either a PM or an ICD may be pacing-dependent (eg, history of symptomatic bradycardia, inadequate escape rhythm, or history of atrioventricular [AV] nodal ablation). Electromagnetic interference (EMI)-induced inhibition of pacing may result in severe bradycardia or asystole in such patients. Thus, if EMI is likely and the patient is pacing-dependent, the PM or ICD should be reprogrammed to an asynchronous pacing mode by a programming machine (or in some cases by placement of a magnet). This is possible in all PMs and in most currently implanted ICDs; however, magnet placement will never alter the pacing mode of an ICD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Does the patient have an ICD? </strong>&ndash; When devices generating EMI<strong> </strong>will be used near an ICD (ie, a surgical procedure involving the use of electrosurgery superior to the umbilicus), the antitachycardia therapy must be suspended. This can be accomplished with a programming machine or, in some cases, by applying a magnet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105465 \">table 3</a>).

However, a magnet should be readily available in case of unanticipated EMI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>If reprogramming is necessary, can a magnet be used for this purpose? </strong>&ndash; The decision to reprogram a CIED with a programming machine or to utilize a magnet for this purpose depends on the type of CIED and how it is programmed, the patient's underlying rhythm, likelihood of EMI, proximity of the CIED to the surgical field, and planned patient positioning during surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1373117221\" class=\"local\">'Magnet application'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If magnet application is planned, the device's magnet response should be known.

For example, the asynchronous pacing mode interferes with AV synchrony and CRT.

(See <a href=\"#H1817455467\" class=\"local\">'Electromagnetic interference'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In such circumstances, CIED reprogramming to suspend anti-tachyarrhythmia therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initiate asynchronous pacing is advised.

Also, monopolar ESU is avoided, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H2588569500\" class=\"local\">'Management of electromagnetic interference'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For emergency surgery with potential for EMI superior to the umbilicus, a magnet is placed over a PM in a pacing-dependent patient to initiate asynchronous pacing, or over an ICD to disable anti-tachyarrhythmia therapy. However, a magnet will not result in asynchronous pacing in an ICD, and profound bradycardia or asystole may still occur due to EMI-induced pacing inhibition. Thus, it may be necessary to minimize EMI by use of bipolar instead of monopolar ESU, or use monopolar ESU in short, intermittent, and irregular bursts at the lowest feasible energy levels. (See <a href=\"#H2753205\" class=\"local\">'Emergency surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before attempting emergency external defibrillation or cardioversion of a patient with a magnet applied to an ICD, the magnet should be removed to permit reactivation of the ICD's anti-tachyarrhythmia function, and all sources of EMI should be discontinued. If magnet removal is not immediately successful, an external defibrillator should be employed to cardiovert or defibrillate via the transcutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">pacing/defibrillator</span> pads. (See <a href=\"#H2753174\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative emergencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactivation of CIED function should be accomplished in the immediate postoperative period if reprogramming with a machine was performed, and postoperative device interrogation should be performed after emergency surgery that proceeded without preoperative evaluation, or in any patient with suspected CIED malfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116028\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116028 \">algorithm 2</a>). We monitor the patient continuously with both ECG and pulse oximetry plethysmography and leave the transcutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">pacing/defibrillator</span> pads in place until reactivation and proper function are confirmed.
