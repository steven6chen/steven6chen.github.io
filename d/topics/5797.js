Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the mainstay for monitoring prosthetic valves and can generally identify normal function as well as evidence of valve dysfunction (stenosis). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is helpful particularly for assessment of valve structure and prosthetic valve regurgitation, especially involving mechanical mitral and tricuspid prostheses as well as assessment of endocarditis for all valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98560\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98560 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>This topic will review echocardiography of prosthetic heart valves.

The TTE should include Doppler measurements of transvalvular velocities as well as assessment of valvular and paravalvular regurgitation. Adequate Doppler velocity recordings can generally be obtained despite acoustic shadowing from valve prostheses. </p><p>Transvalvular gradients for normally functioning prosthetic valves are dependent upon valve type, location, and size (as compiled in the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography <a href=\"http://asecho.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2009_Evaluation-of-Prosthetic-Valves.pdf&amp;token=XXF4jqlTTS8bSAkxQVmK8/Mi9T+tObwcizedd8kMkCDBDI5FuY3qAZARlvaNAM2cj6FS92Qw6+IsSid4ryBvI/KSlfF9Nw+YBANVzPbzKnh7RsOFY/ZMGA8alE8jLzWx&amp;TOPIC_ID=5333\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a>) as well as patient-specific factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A higher than expected initial gradient is often due to a high output state (eg, due to anemia) or patient-prosthetic mismatch and is only rarely due to early dysfunction of the prosthesis.

Symptoms and signs of mechanical valve dysfunction due to thrombosis, pannus formation, or endocarditis include a new or louder murmur, new onset of dyspnea and signs of heart failure, thromboembolism, and hemolysis. For patients with a prosthetic aortic valve, a TTE may also be useful since it provides proper alignment for Doppler assessment of transvalvular velocities, gradient, and valve area. For all patients with a prosthetic valve, TTE may be useful for assessment of biventricular cavity size and systolic function as well as an estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. TEE has much higher sensitivity for detection of prosthetic valve vegetations and extra-valvular extension of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604074544\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance of old bioprosthetic valves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the incidence of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction markedly increases 10 years after implantation, we agree with the in the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valve guidelines, stating that a TTE is reasonable in patients with a bioprosthetic valve after the first 10 years, even in the absence of change in clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The guideline suggested annual TTE thereafter, but every two to three years may be reasonable if valve function is normal with annual echocardiograms when valvular dysfunction presents. &#160;</p><p>Routine annual echocardiographic evaluation is not indicated in patients with mechanical valve prostheses with normal postoperative baseline examination and no signs or symptoms of valve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604074847\"><span class=\"h1\">KEY COMPONENTS OF THE ECHOCARDIOGRAM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604074867\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with prosthetic valves includes imaging of the valve and its seating; assessment of valve hemodynamics, including transvalvular velocities; identification and quantification of valve regurgitation (intravalvular and paravalvular); and measurement of cardiac chamber sizes, left ventricular wall thicknesses, and assessment of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. </p><p>Prosthetic valves are generally inherently stenotic, so Doppler velocity recordings across normally functioning valves are similar to those of mild native valve stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Normal function of the valve is confirmed by evaluation of the contour of the jet velocity, including the acceleration time (the time from onset of flow to maximal velocity), the effective orifice area (EOA), and the Doppler velocity index (DVI). Expected ranges for gradients and EOA for normally functioning prosthetic valves are included in appendices to the 2009 American Society of Echocardiography prosthetic valve <a href=\"http://asecho.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2009_Evaluation-of-Prosthetic-Valves.pdf&amp;token=XXF4jqlTTS8bSAkxQVmK8/Mi9T+tObwcizedd8kMkCDBDI5FuY3qAZARlvaNAM2cj6FS92Qw6+IsSid4ryBvI/KSlfF9Nw+YBANVzPbzKnh7RsOFY/ZMGA8alE8jLzWx&amp;TOPIC_ID=5333\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a>. </p><p>An increase in the transprosthetic velocity could be due to valvular obstruction, regurgitation, or an increase in cardiac output, whereas a decrease in either the EOA or the DVI is more specific for prosthetic obstruction. A Doppler velocity pattern demonstrating normal transprosthetic flow gradient and flow duration is usually sufficient to exclude a stenotic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the gradient may not be elevated in the setting of obstruction with low stroke volume.</p><p>The EOA is calculated using the continuity equation:</p><p>EOA = stroke <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/VTI<sub>PrV</span> </sub></p><p>where VTI<sub>PrV</sub> is the velocity time integral through the prosthesis determined by continuous wave Doppler. The stroke volume is generally derived from an adjacent site as cross-sectional area (estimated from the associated diameter and assuming a circular area) multiplied by the VTI of flow measured by pulsed wave Doppler at that site. For prosthetic aortic and pulmonic valves, site for calculation of stroke volume is at the site of flow just proximal to the valve. For prosthetic mitral valves, stroke volume may be calculated at the aortic or pulmonary annulus if no significant regurgitation is present. </p><p>The DVI is a simplified method for evaluating aortic valve obstruction. The DVI is the ratio of the velocity proximal to the valve by pulsed wave Doppler to the velocity through the valve by continuous wave Doppler. Use of this index avoids the need to measure stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A DVI &lt;0.25 suggests significant valve obstruction. &#160;</p><p>Prosthetic aortic regurgitation (intravalvular or paravalvular) can generally be identified by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Prosthetic mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are usually difficult to assess on TTE due to acoustic shadowing and thus transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604074874\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of TTE and TEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTE and TEE are complementary in the evaluation of prosthetic valves. As mentioned, acoustic shadowing caused by prosthetic material may limit TTE visualization of prosthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">discs/leaflets,</span> vegetations, abscesses, and thrombi. In addition, while prosthetic aortic valve regurgitation is usually well visualized on TTE color Doppler imaging, prosthetic mitral regurgitation is frequently undetectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, TEE is the imaging method of choice when the TTE is technically inadequate or when there are borderline findings on the TTE in a patient in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of prosthetic malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, one study of 170 patients who underwent surgery for valve dysfunction found that diagnostic errors, ie, findings on the TTE that were not confirmed at surgery, occurred in 12 percent and were primarily related to paravalvular regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Since TTE images are obtained anteriorly, they are usually sufficient for evaluation of aortic prostheses. However, since the atria are situated in the far field where resolution is low, they are shadowed by mechanical and to lesser extent, biological mitral prostheses, so the evaluation of mitral prosthetic function is limited. On the other hand, TEE images are taken from a position posterior to the heart, so the atrial side of the mitral and tricuspid valves can be well seen. TTE demonstrates the ventricular side of the valve that lies in its near field, whereas TEE does not. The presence of mitral and aortic devices in the same patient may make the task of the echocardiographer more difficult and may require both TTE and TEE. </p><p>The physician evaluating a prosthetic device with TEE should be aware of the range of abnormalities that are possible in these devices and should match those possibilities to the patient's presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98560\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98560 \">figure 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H604075662\" class=\"local\">'Prosthetic aortic stenosis'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Causes of obstruction include pannus ingrowth, thrombus, and vegetation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64234%7ECARD%2F58762%7ECARD%2F74517\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64234 graphicRef58762 graphicRef74517 \">movie 1A-C</a>). Clinical clues to this possibility include the age of the valve and the adequacy of anticoagulation. In a bioprosthesis or heterograft, the leaflets themselves may become calcified and immobile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-bioprosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis and obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once there is a high suspicion of obstruction, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed for etiologic definition with both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, especially for mitral prostheses. Doppler transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary means to diagnose prosthetic valve obstruction; hemodynamic cardiac catheterization is not routinely needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. 3D-TEE may be helpful in identifying pannus, although its utility has not been well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of suspected aortic pannus, the distal end of the left ventricular outflow tract should be examined both with imaging and with color flow Doppler. Pannus tends to lie close to the valve ring and can be easily overlooked. There can be proximal flow acceleration present on color flow Doppler that suggests pannus, which, on further searching with a variety of frequencies, angles, and gain settings, will be detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the mitral position, the same procedure should be followed. Finding a high grade of spontaneous contrast in the left atrium, with or without thrombi, or finding thrombus around the sewing ring in the setting of adequate anticoagulation should heighten suspicion of pannus formation. Thin fibrillar strands may also be encountered adjacent to the mitral annulus and on the sewing ring of the valve. These structures are brightly reflective and highly mobile and may or may not be associated with a pathologic process.</p><p/><p>Management of valve obstruction due to thrombus or pannus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-bioprosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis and obstruction&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Distinction between thrombus and pannus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common etiology for prosthetic valve obstruction is thrombus formation; pannus formation due to fibrous tissue ingrowth is far less common. In one surgical study of 112 obstructed mechanical valves, pannus formation was the underlying cause in 11 percent of valves, pannus formation in combination with thrombus was present in 12 percent, while thrombus alone was the etiology in the remaining cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Since treatment options for thrombus and pannus differ, it is important to distinguish between these two causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-bioprosthetic-valve-thrombosis-and-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis and obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiographic differentiation of pannus and thrombus may be difficult. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombus tends to be larger, mobile, be somewhat less echo-dense, and more commonly associated with spontaneous echo contrast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pannus is highly echogenic, consistent with its fibrous composition, and is usually firmly fixed (minimal mobility) to the valve apparatus and may be difficult to distinguish from the sewing ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>In order to establish factors associated with the presence of thrombus, one study evaluated the findings on a preoperative TEE in 53 patients with an intraoperative diagnosis of pannus or thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In one study of 23 patients who presented with 24 obstructed valves, clinical, TTE, and TEE data were compared to pathology at surgery in order to determine the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics that differentiate thrombus from pannus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thrombus was established in 14 valves and pannus in 10. Pannus formation was more common in the aortic position. From the standpoint of echocardiography, thrombus was more likely to be associated with soft ultrasound density (92 versus 29 percent).</p><p>The role of other imaging modalities (eg, multidetector computed tomography) in distinguishing thrombus from pannus is discussed separately.

The physiologic regurgitation associated with prosthetic valves appears only briefly and is due to retrograde volume displacement as the valve leaflets close. This type of regurgitation is detected by highly sensitive color flow Doppler imaging on TEE. In addition, a certain amount of more prolonged &quot;leakage backflow&quot; regurgitation occurs after the valve closes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These are often referred to as &quot;washing jets,&quot; believed to inhibit the formation of thrombi.</p><p>In an evaluation of 136 mechanical prosthetic valves, TEE color flow Doppler imaging revealed regurgitant jets in 95 percent of the mitral prostheses and 44 percent of the aortic prostheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, TTE documented regurgitant jets in only 28 percent and 29 percent, respectively. The lower incidence of detected regurgitation in the aortic position may be explained by the shadowing of the left ventricular outflow tract in TEE imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Normally functioning mechanical valves, such as the bileaflet St. Jude prosthesis, usually have two to four centrally directed regurgitant jets. Features associated with these jets include a low intensity and only minimal penetration into the atrium, generally less than 3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>].

Normally functioning bioprosthetic and heterografts are less likely to have these small regurgitant signals; when mild regurgitation is present, there is usually one central jet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathologic regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pathologic regurgitation associated with mechanical valves is perivalvular.

The bioprosthetic leaflets can usually be seen and are often thickened and calcified with possible perforation or disruption leading to a flail leaflet.

The results suggested that a peak transmitral E wave velocity exceeding 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> or a ratio of peak diastolic transmitral flow to left ventricular outflow tract velocity greater than 2.2 identifies prosthetic valve regurgitation (sensitivity 92 percent, specificity 78 percent), provided that the valve is not stenotic (pressure half-time less than 130 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. On the other hand, a prosthetic valve with a peak E wave Doppler velocity of less than 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> a ratio of peak diastolic transmitral flow velocity to left ventricular outflow velocity of less than 2.2, and a pressure half-time of less than 130 msec has a 98 percent chance of being normal (neither stenotic nor regurgitant).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604075391\"><span class=\"h4\">Paravalvular regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trace or mild paravalvular regurgitation immediately following valve replacement is common with both mechanical and bioprosthetic prostheses and generally not progressive. Paravalvular regurgitation can develop late after valve replacement due to suture dehiscence, from a poorly seated ring, or from endocarditis leading to valve dehiscence. Hemolysis is a common complication of these leaks, especially when they occur with a mitral valve prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Paravalvular regurgitation should be suspected when a patient with a prosthetic valve presents with hemolytic anemia. Severe hemolysis can also occur after mitral valve repair, when regurgitation develops around the annuloplasty ring. A TEE is frequently required to detect paravalvular leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;, section on 'Malfunctioning cardiac valves and cardiac assist devices'</a>.)</p><p>To recognize a paravalvular leak, TEE must be performed with a high color frame rate in several views from several angles outside the sewing ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There should be a careful search for periprosthetic leaks around as much of the valve circumference as possible and an attempt made to define the extent of the regurgitation once it is identified. The origin of a periprosthetic leak may appear deceptively narrow when caused by disruption of a limited number of sutures. Three-dimensional echocardiography is helpful in mapping the extent of the paravalvular leak and has proven efficacious for guiding percutaneous device closure of these leaks. &#160;</p><p>The most severe form of paravalvular regurgitation is seen when there is dehiscence of a substantial portion of the sewing ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this setting, there may be such severe regurgitation that the regurgitant flow is almost laminar. The sewing ring on echocardiography may be seen to rock with each cardiac cycle; mobile echo densities representing the liberated suture material often can be visualized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604076206\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic valve dehiscence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prosthetic valve dehiscence is identified on echocardiography as a separation of the prosthetic ring from the native valvular annulus and is usually accompanied by paravalvular regurgitation. Valve dehiscence is most frequently caused by endocarditis. Rocking of a prosthetic valve is a sign of dehiscence, particularly in the aortic position. Rocking of a prosthetic mitral valve can be caused by dehiscence or by retained native posterior leaflet or posterior and anterior leaflets, with the latter generally not accompanied by paravalvular regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prosthetic valve dehiscence may be identified by TTE but is frequently better visualized with TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a suspected cardiac cause for embolism, the source may be a thrombus from a nonobstructed or obstructed prosthetic heart valve. TEE is often necessary to establish this diagnosis. In a series of 52 patients with a prosthetic heart valve who underwent TEE after a suspected systemic embolic event, 12 percent had a definitive prosthetic valve thrombus and 10 percent had fibrous strands on the valve, which were suggestive of thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It is important to differentiate pathologic prosthetic regurgitation, which is often perivalvular from the normal &ldquo;physiologic&rdquo; prosthetic regurgitation. Mechanical prosthetic valves displace blood when the occluder disc closes and may also have small holes in the occluders and at hinge points; the pattern is characteristic for the valve type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Biologic valves may have minor degrees of central regurgitation, which are detectable due to the high sensitivity of color flow Doppler.</p><p>Grading the severity of pathological prosthetic aortic regurgitation can be challenging and an integrative approach is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When there is significant dehiscence of the valve (more than 40 percent), a rocking motion is detected, which is usually associated with severe regurgitation. The following features suggest severe regurgitation: jet width &gt;65 percent, pressure half-time &lt;200 msec, holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta, regurgitant volume &gt;60 mL, and a regurgitant fraction &gt;50 percent. In addition, chronic severe aortic regurgitation is a cause of left ventricular dilation. &#160; </p><p>While TTE can detect and often grade prosthetic aortic regurgitation, the cause is often not apparent. TEE should be performed in order to diagnose endocarditis with or without abscess, thrombus interfering with disc closure, and bioprosthetic leaflet tears &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604075674\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prosthetic mitral valve obstruction can also occur because of thrombus, pannus, vegetation, and bioprosthetic leaflet thickening or calcification. The peak transmitral velocity, the mean gradient, and pressure half-time should all be considered in the context of the heart rate and compared to previous echocardiographic studies. </p><p>The prosthetic mitral peak E wave velocity is usually &lt;1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> at &ldquo;normal&rdquo; heart rates, but may be as high as 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span>. Higher velocities are seen with bioprostheses. The mean gradient is usually &lt;6 mmHg. The pressure half-time is usually &lt;130 msec. EOA can be calculated using the continuity equation but is not as frequently used. DVI is calculated as the VTI<sub>PrMV</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/VTI<sub>LVOT</sub></span> and is normally &lt;2.2 for mechanical valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The DVI will be normal in high output states, but elevated in both the case of either mitral prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When the DVI is increased, the pressure half-time can help differentiate between stenosis and regurgitation. A pressure half-time &gt;200 msec is most consistent with stenosis; whereas a pressure half-time &lt;130 msec would suggest regurgitation. Intermediate values are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>TEE for mechanical valves or bioprosthetic valves can further define the pathology and elucidate the mechanism for dysfunction. When TEE is unavailable or cannot be performed, fluoroscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gated CT can be useful for assessing mechanical valve motion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604075680\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the color Doppler jet is usually obscured because of acoustic shadowing caused by the prosthesis, other clues to regurgitation must be heeded. There may be increased rocking of the prosthesis associated with dehiscence of the sewing ring. The peak transmitral E wave velocity is increased as is the mean gradient, although the pressure half-time remains within normal range. The left ventricular volume may be increased and the ejection fraction is usually preserved. However, in the presence of significant mitral regurgitation, the forward stroke volume falls, which can be inferred by a decrease in the left ventricular outflow tract VTI. The pulmonary artery pressure may be increased. Suspicion of prosthetic mitral regurgitation should prompt a TEE, which is diagnostic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604075686\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic pulmonary valves dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical valves are rarely used in the pulmonary position because of a higher risk of valve thrombosis. Most frequently bioprosthetic valves, homografts, or heterografts are used. Assessment of prosthetic pulmonary valve stenosis is similar to aortic prostheses. An initial assessment with TTE for <span class=\"nowrap\">velocity/gradient</span> and assessment of pulmonic regurgitation is reasonable. &#160;</p><p>The peak velocity through a homograft is usually &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> and through a heterograft &lt;3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span>. There are limited data on the use of DVI or EOA for prosthetic pulmonary valves. An otherwise unexplained increase in transvalvular velocity on serial studies may be the most reliable method of detecting stenosis. An increase in the right ventricular systolic pressure, which can be estimated from the tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity, may indirectly indicate prosthetic pulmonary valve stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Prosthetic pulmonary valve regurgitation is usually detected by a low velocity pulmonary regurgitant jet on color flow Doppler in the parasternal short axis view on TTE. Severe prosthetic pulmonary regurgitation can be inferred by broad color flow jet, a dense continuous wave spectral Doppler signal, and rapid deceleration of the pulmonary regurgitant signal. A dilated right ventricle also suggests severe regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604075692\"><span class=\"h2\">Prosthetic tricuspid valve dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles for evaluating the prosthetic tricuspid valve are similar to that of the mitral valve. Bioprostheses are more commonly used than mechanical prostheses in the tricuspid position due to issues of valve thrombosis. Because of the respirophasic variation in transtricuspid velocities, at least five beats should be measured. &#160;</p><p>Based on a series of echocardiograms performed shortly after tricuspid bioprosthetic valve implantation in 285 patients, the peak E wave velocity should be less than 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> the mean gradient &lt;9 mmHg, and the pressure half-time &lt;200 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Echocardiograms performed early post-implantation in 78 patients with a mechanical tricuspid valve prosthesis (St. Jude or CardioMedics Standard prostheses) demonstrated the following: peak E velocity &lt;1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> mean gradient &lt;6 mmHg, and pressure half-time &lt;130 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-prosthetic-heart-valves/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Values greater than these suggest stenosis. </p><p>When the peak E wave velocity and mean gradient are increased with a low pressure half-time, regurgitation is suggested. Acoustic shadowing may impede detection of prosthetic tricuspid valve regurgitation as it does with mitral prosthetic regurgitation. Clinical and echocardiographic findings suggestive of prosthetic tricuspid regurgitation should prompt TEE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784086512\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
