The duration of labor, duration of rupture of membranes, mode of delivery, the newborn's condition at delivery, and resuscitation, if any, should be reviewed. Infants who require resuscitation are at risk of developing postresuscitative complications, such as hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and central nervous system complications.

Preterm infants (GA below 37 weeks), including those born late preterm (GA 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</span> to 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</span> weeks), are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared with term infants (GA 39 to 42 weeks).

The area should be warm and quiet, and should have good lighting.</p><p>The examination includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation of the infant's general appearance, including <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> body position at rest, body movement, color, and respiratory effort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body measurements (ie, weight, length, and head circumference) and vital signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of individual body parts and organs.</p><p/><p>The examination should be conducted in a systematic manner, as a consistent approach ensures that all aspects are evaluated. Although the exact order is not important, the examination is optimized by initially observing the infant's general appearance followed by auscultation of the lungs and heart while the infant is lying quietly. The examination usually proceeds from head to foot as outlined in the following sections. Examination of the hips and spine, which is apt to disturb the infant, usually is performed last. The hips are examined while the infant is supine, then the infant is turned prone to examine the back.</p><p>The date and time of the examination should be recorded. Findings considered normal close to delivery (eg, a transitional heart murmur) may be abnormal on the second or third day after birth. The examination should include assessment of GA. Knowledge of the level of maturity may be important in the interpretation of physical findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-assessment-of-gestational-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal assessment of gestational age&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">General appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to touching the infant, much can be learned by observing the appearance of the undressed infant in the resting, nonstimulated state. General inspection should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of any deformation (eg, metatarsus adductus) or malformations (eg, cleft lip), which may indicate the presence of a syndrome.

Signs of respiratory distress are abnormal and suggest pulmonary disease. They include rapid breathing, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles (eg, significant subcostal, intercostal, supraclavicular, or suprasternal retractions), and grunting. The respiratory count should be conducted over a full minute to account for the variable breathing rate in the neonate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of position and movement &minus; The newborn's posture at rest usually reflects the intrauterine position. Term newborns who have predominantly been positioned in a vertex presentation typically lie with the hips, knees, and ankles flexed. Infants who were in a breech position often have extended legs. A frank breech presentation may result in markedly abducted and externally rotated legs, which may lead to lower extremity deformations. A normal infant moves all extremities symmetrically. Deviation of posture or abnormal movement may be an indication of birth injury or deformation due to intrauterine positioning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-birth-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal birth injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-positional-deformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity positional deformations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of color &minus; A normal infant appears pink. Acrocyanosis, a bluish appearance of the hands, feet, and perioral area, is common in the first few days after delivery. However, central cyanosis, which is seen best on the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth, suggests hypoxemia. Bruising also may result in a bluish discoloration.</p><p/><p>Pallor may indicate anemia, caused by acute blood loss at or shortly before delivery or a chronic intrauterine process. A ruddy or plethoric infant may have polycythemia. Infants with polycythemia may appear cyanotic even when they have adequate oxygenation because they have a relatively high amount of unsaturated hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal polycythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia results in jaundice, a yellow color best assessed in natural light. Jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth is considered pathologic, and is usually caused by hemolysis and requires evaluation. Intrauterine staining of the skin with meconium may result in a greenish discoloration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infant's weight, length, and head circumference should be measured and recorded. These measurements are plotted on standard growth curves to determine the percentile according to GA and assess intrauterine growth. In our nursery, we use the Olsen growth curves, which are sex-specific curves based on United States data from over 390,000 infants born between 22 to 42 weeks gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90444 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90443 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The length is measured from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet, with the legs fully extended. This measurement is difficult to do accurately. In order to accurately measure a newborn, a length board should be used by two examiners (one to hold the infant and one to measure the infant). At 40 weeks gestation, the average length is 51 cm (10<sup>th</sup> to 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, 48 to 53 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The fronto-occipital head circumference (FOC) should be measured at its maximum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70799\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70799 \">picture 1</a>). At 40 weeks gestation, the average FOC is 35 cm (10<sup>th</sup> to 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, 33 to 37 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This measurement may change in the first few days after birth as molding and scalp edema resolve. Some clinicians also measure chest circumference, especially if there is concern about lung growth. Chest circumference normally is within 2 cm of the head circumference.</p><p>Data from the Newborn Cross-Sectional Study of the INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Project were used to develop international standards for sex-specific newborn measurements of weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96940 \">table 1</a>), length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107270\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107270 \">table 2</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/public-health-partners/microcephaly-case-definitions.html&amp;token=PrE6w/g9YUmIqWn4tNBkr1eNNIa22LDPmEAK00X8q8lG5NME/gJOYizkZbpyxip97y5LptSkL9IQl3m1yaMeQYEKWyz+6v0HTBnCJgdjxaU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4984\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">head circumference</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107271 \">table 3</a>) for GA between 33 and 42 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Facial palsies and asymmetric crying facies are most obvious when the infant is crying and may go unnoticed in the quiet or sleeping infant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial palsies &ndash; Facial palsies are often seen in infants who are delivered with the use of forceps, and can also be seen in those with a prolonged delivery in mothers with a prominent sacral promontory. Typically, only the mandibular branch of the facial nerve is affected and the infant will have diminished movement on the affected side of the face. The facial palsy is characterized by the loss of the nasolabial fold, partial closing of the eye, and the inability to contract the lower facial muscles on the affected side, leading to the appearance of a &quot;drooping&quot; mouth. When crying, the mouth is drawn over to the unaffected side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Facial palsies resolve completely in a few days to a few weeks. No treatment is required, with the exception of the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">artificial tears</a> in the affected eye. In addition, it is imperative to ensure that the infant can adequately feed prior to discharge. A persistent palsy may imply a central lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric crying facies (ACF) &ndash; ACF are the result of congenital absence or hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar to facial palsies, the muscles controlling movement of one side of the mouth are affected, thus there is asymmetry of the face upon crying. Unlike facial palsies, the muscles controlling movement of the upper face are normal; thus, the nasolabial folds are normal, and when the infant cries, the forehead wrinkles and both eyes close normally. This is typically a benign condition and becomes less noticeable as the child gets older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ACF can be an associated finding in some syndromes, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and Cayler cardiofacial syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. One prospective study of 5532 infants revealed an incidence of ACF of 0.31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], with 2 of the 17 affected infants having other significant malformations. In another review of 35 infants with ACF, 16 had other associated anomalies, although many of them were minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When ACF is diagnosed, it is prudent to perform a thorough examination for other congenital anomalies, in particular, identifying any cardiovascular abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Eyes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial examination of the eyes may be difficult to perform because the eyelids often are edematous after delivery. Most infants will open their eyes spontaneously when held vertically in an environment with low ambient light.</p><p>The examiner should note the position and spacing of the eyes, symmetry of the eyes, width of palpebral fissures, eye color, appearance of the sclera and conjunctiva, condition of the eyelids, pupillary size, and eye movement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spacing &minus; Hypertelorism, an abnormally wide interpupillary distance, is associated with a large number of syndromes, including Apert syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly type I) and trisomy 13. If eye spacing appears abnormal, the distance between the eyes should be measured and compared with standard values for the newborn infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114030 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interpupillary distance approximately ranges from 3.25 to 4.5 cm (1.3 to 1.8 inches)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inner canthal distance approximately ranges from 1.5 to 2.55 cm (0.6 to 1 inch)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outer canthal distance approximately ranges from 5.2 to 7.3 cm (2 to 2.9 inches)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symmetry &minus; Asymmetry of the eyes may be the result of prominent epicanthal folds (skin folds over the medial aspect of the eyes), a difference in the size of the globes, or ptosis. Epicanthal folds are rarely normal and usually suggest a syndrome (eg, trisomy 21) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64030 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpebral fissures &minus; Widened or narrow palpebral fissures are normal for some patients, but can be part of a syndrome complex in others. Upward slanting from the inner canthus is typically seen in infants with Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64030 \">picture 6</a>), whereas down slanting palpebral fissures are characteristic of Treacher Collins and Apert syndromes, and narrow short palpebral fissures in DiGeorge syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye movement &minus; The examiner should assess extraocular muscle movement. Symmetrical movement of the eyes should occur as the patient is held vertically and moved gently from side to side. Although asymmetric eye movement is common in the first month of life, asymmetric movement may be an indication of an abnormality within the brain or to cranial nerves III, IV, or VI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerae &minus; The sclerae normally are white and clear. In preterm infants, the sclerae may appear light blue because the darker color of the underlying uveal tissue is transmitted through the thin underdeveloped sclerae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the sclerae appear deep blue, osteogenesis imperfecta should be considered. In this condition, the discoloration is caused by inadequate development of scleral collagen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjunctiva &minus; The conjunctiva should be examined for hemorrhage, inflammation, or purulent discharge. Subconjunctival hemorrhages can occur spontaneously during birth, but are more common following a traumatic delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cornea &minus; The corneal diameter in most newborns is approximately 10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Corneal enlargement (&gt;12 mm) suggests glaucoma, especially if accompanied by photophobia, excessive tearing, or corneal haze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50389\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50389 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pupils &minus; Pupils should be assessed for their shape and reaction to light. Normal pupils are round and constrict in response to a bright light. Pupillary reaction occurs consistently after 32 weeks GA, but may be apparent in some infants as early as 28 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Defects in the iris (eg, coloboma) should be noted and may be suggestive of a syndrome, such as renal coloboma syndrome or CHARGE (coloboma, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, retardation, genital and ear anomalies) syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-and-acquired-abnormalities-of-the-optic-nerve#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies and acquired abnormalities of the optic nerve&quot;, section on 'Optic disc coloboma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red reflex &minus; An ophthalmoscopic examination should determine whether or not a red reflex is present in all neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A normal red reflex is seen if the lens and underlying structures are clear. The red reflex test is performed observing both eyes of the infant through an ophthalmoscope with the ophthalmoscope lens power set at &quot;0&quot; at a distance approximately 18 inches away from the infant. A normal red reflex emanates from both eyes and is symmetric in character without evidence of opacities or white spots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66431\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66431 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dark spots in the red reflex, a markedly diminished reflex, presence of a white reflex, or asymmetry of the reflex are indications for referral to an ophthalmologist. Abnormalities of the lens (eg, cataract), vitreous (eg, persistent fetal vasculature), or retina (eg, retinoblastoma) produce a white pupil (leukocoria). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-leukocoria#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with leukocoria&quot;, section on 'Causes of leukocoria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a large observational study, the red reflex test was shown to be a useful screening test to detect anterior segment abnormalities (eg, coloboma, cataract, or vitreous and aqueous opacities) but was less sensitive in detecting posterior lesions (retinal abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Ears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ears are inspected for their position, size, and appearance. The ears are in a normal position if the helix is intersected by a horizontal line drawn from the outer canthus of the eye perpendicular to the vertical axis of the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If the helix falls below this line, the ears are considered low-set. An ear is posteriorly rotated if its vertical axis deviates more than 10 degrees from the vertical axis of the head.</p><p>The ears should be inspected for branchial cleft cysts (which may be located in the preauricular area and along the line anterior to the sternocleidomastoid in the neck), sinuses, preauricular skin tags or pits, or dysplastic features. External ear abnormalities increase the risk of additional anomalies of the middle and inner ear, which are associated with hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In addition, external ear malformations often are associated with syndromes of multiple congenital anomalies that include renal malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, patients with isolated minor external ear anomalies (eg, preauricular skin tags or pits) do not appear to have a significant increased risk of renal anomalies. As a result, routine renal imaging for patients with isolated minor ear abnormalities appears to be unnecessary unless accompanied by other major malformations or multiple congenital anomaly syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the ear&quot;, section on 'Preauricular pits'</a>.)</p><p>The ear canals should be observed for patency. Visualization of the tympanic membranes is limited by the small size of the ear canal and the presence of vernix and other debris. This examination usually is not done in the newborn period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Nose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nose should be examined for its shape and patency. The shape of the nose may be abnormal because of intrauterine deformation or the birth process. In this case, it will return to a normal shape within a few days of birth. An extremely thin or unusually broad nose, or a depressed nasal bridge may occur with some malformation syndromes.</p><p>The nares may appear asymmetric if the nasal cartilage is dislocated from the vomerine groove (septal deviation). This condition can be distinguished from a positional deformity by depression of the tip of the nose. A dislocated septum appears angled within the nares and does not resume a normal position when released. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-birth-injuries#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal birth injuries&quot;, section on 'Nasal septal dislocation'</a>.)</p><p>Patency of the nares should be established because infants are predominantly nose breathers. This can be accomplished by noting the movement of a piece of cotton or thread placed in front of each naris. Obstruction may be caused by edema related to vigorous suctioning after birth, or be due to anatomical causes, such as choanal atresia. The latter can be tested by passage of a feeding tube or suction catheter through the nose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-nose#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the nose&quot;, section on 'Choanal atresia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Mouth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size and shape of the mouth should be assessed. The maxillae and mandible should fit well together and open at equal angles bilaterally. Asymmetry of the mouth (asynclitism) usually is caused by intrauterine position and resolves with time. A small jaw (micrognathia) may be seen in Robin sequence. The lip should be examined for evidence of a cleft.

Although they most commonly occur as an isolated finding, natal teeth may be associated with a variety of syndromes, such as chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis-van Creveld syndrome), pachyonychia congenita, Sotos syndrome, and Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. Treatment may involve observation, smoothing of the incisal edge (to prevent potential discomfort during breastfeeding and ulceration in the floor of the mouth), or extraction.

The presence and amount of breast tissue may be helpful in assessment of GA. Breast hypertrophy caused by exposure to maternal hormones occurs in both males and females and can be asymmetric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110966 \">picture 10</a>). Occasionally, breasts will secrete a thin milky fluid known as &quot;witch's milk&quot; for several days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Widely spaced nipples occur in some genetic syndromes (eg, Turner syndrome).

In general, an internipple distance that is &gt;25 percent of chest circumference is considered widely spaced.</p><p>Supernumerary nipple, or accessory mammary tissue, is a common finding, occurring with an incidence of approximately 1 in 40 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is more common in African-American infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Supernumerary nipples are usually found inferior and medial to the true breasts, along the milk line, a vertical line that extends from the axilla to the pubic region. Supernumerary nipples are discussed in greater detail separately.

These may fluctuate depending upon the state of wakefulness, and whether the infant is active or crying. The respiratory rate should be counted for a full minute to account for variations in rate and rhythm. A normal rate is 40 to 60 breaths per minute.</p><p>Infants with respiratory disorders often have tachypnea and retractions. Other signs of respiratory distress include use of accessory respiratory muscles (eg, flaring of the nasal alae) and grunting. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Chest wall movement'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neonatal respiratory distress: Disorders of transition&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auscultation of the lungs should be performed with the infant as quiet as possible. In general, this is best accomplished early in the assessment prior to palpation of the abdomen, head, and neck.</p><p>Normal breath sounds are bronchovesicular and are heard equally on both sides of the chest. The breath sounds should be clear, although some infants may have scattered rales for a few hours after delivery. Abnormal breath sounds are unusual in the absence of tachypnea or signs of respiratory distress. In infants with respiratory disease, grunting sometimes is audible only with a stethoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation of the chest wall determines the apical impulse and locates the position of the heart. Because the right ventricle is dominant in the newborn, the point of maximal impulse is best felt in the area of the left lower sternal border. Palpation also can detect the presence of a heave, tap, or thrill.</p><p>Auscultation should be performed with a warmed stethoscope while the infant lies quietly. Thorough evaluation necessitates auscultation of all areas of the precordium, as well as the back and axillary areas. The process includes noting the rate and rhythm and listening carefully for the first and second heart sounds, and the presence of a murmur. The heart rate is normally 120 to 160 beats per minute, but may decrease to 85 to 90 beats per minute in some term infants during sleep.</p><p>Heart sounds usually are heard best along the left sternal border. Prominent heart sounds in the right chest may signify dextrocardia. In general, the first heart sound is a singular sound caused by nearly simultaneous closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves and is best heard at the apex. The second heart sound, best heard at the left upper sternal border, is caused by closure of the pulmonary and aortic valves, and normally is split.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Murmurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart murmurs are characterized by the intensity and quality of the sound they create, when they occur in the cardiac cycle, their location, and whether they are transmitted. The intensity of murmurs is graded on a scale of I to VI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Distinguishing pathologic from innocent murmurs'</a>.)</p><p>In the first few days after birth, most newborns have murmurs that are transient and benign. They usually are caused by a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or pulmonary branch stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>]. The latter is more likely if the murmur persists after 24 hours when most PDAs have closed. The PDA murmur is continuous, often described as &quot;machinery-like&quot; or harsh in quality. It usually is loudest under the left clavicle (second intercostal space), but may radiate down the left sternal border. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The intensity and quality of the murmur and associated findings usually can differentiate innocent murmurs from those associated with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Diminished femoral pulses may indicate coarctation of the aorta, whereas an increased pulse pressure may occur with PDA. If femoral pulses are abnormal, brachial, radial, and pedal pulses should be palpated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdomen should be examined when the infant is quiet. The size and overall appearance should be assessed. The normal abdomen is slightly protuberant. Distension is abnormal and may indicate conditions such as intestinal obstruction, organomegaly, or ascites. The abdomen may be scaphoid in the presence of a diaphragmatic hernia. Many normal infants have diastasis recti, resulting from the nonunion of the two rectus muscles, which may result in an umbilical hernia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63270 \">picture 11</a>). Other abdominal wall defects, such as omphalocele (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71646\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71646 \">picture 12</a>) or gastroschisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61463 \">picture 13</a>) , usually are identified at delivery or prenatally by ultrasound.

Holding the infant's legs in a flexed position and having the infant suck on a pacifier or the examiner's gloved finger may facilitate relaxation of the abdominal wall muscles.</p><p>The liver edge normally is palpated 1 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. The liver should be soft with a smooth edge. The spleen usually is not palpable, although some normal infants may have a palpable spleen tip.</p><p>The kidneys may be palpated through the anterior abdominal wall. One approach to facilitate palpation of the lower poles of the kidneys is to place the fingertips above and below the lower quadrants and apply moderate pressure; this maneuver traps the kidneys between the fingertips. The left kidney is more easily palpable than the right.</p><p>Any other palpable abdominal mass is abnormal and requires further investigation. Most abdominal masses in newborns are enlarged kidneys caused by hydronephrosis or cystic renal disease. Masses may also result from tumors, such as neuroblastomas or teratomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h3\">Umbilical cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord is inspected for general appearance, amount of Wharton's jelly, and the umbilical vessels.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thin cord may indicate poor maternal nutritional status or intrauterine compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema surrounding the stump, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an odorous discharge may indicate omphalitis (ie, infection of the umbilicus).

SUA is associated with an increased rate of chromosomal and other congenital anomalies, including renal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Currently available data demonstrate there is a low risk of a significant renal abnormality in infants with an isolated SUA. As a result, we do not perform further imaging for healthy term infants with a SUA if there is no other identified abnormality.

The appearance of the genitalia varies with GA. The labia minora and clitoris are prominent in preterm infants, while the labia majora becomes larger as the infant approaches term. The genitalia in growth-restricted females may appear immature due to decreased deposition of fat in the labia majora. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-assessment-of-gestational-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal assessment of gestational age&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The vaginal opening should be fully visible. Many infants have vaginal skin tags, representing the slight protrusion of vaginal epithelium at the posterior fourchette. Withdrawal from maternal hormones often results in a milky white vaginal discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged.</p><p>The labia minora should be separated to detect whether the hymen, which normally has some opening, is imperforate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57977 \">figure 7</a>). Imperforate hymen can cause hydrometrocolpos, which usually appears as a bulging hymen, especially with crying. Enlargement of the uterus resulting from an imperforate hymen may be detected as a lower midline abdominal mass.

Between 2 and 5 percent of full term and 30 percent of preterm male infants are born with an undescended testicle. Testes descend before six months of age in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H169927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.)</p><p>The penis is stretched to assess length. Normal penile length in the term male is 2.5 to 3.5 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66323 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-the-newborn-infant/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The scrotum of the term male is rugated and pigmented. Enlargement or swelling of the scrotum may be caused by hydroceles, hernias, or, rarely, testicular torsion. Hydroceles are fluid collections around the testes, and usually resolve spontaneously. They can be distinguished from hernias by transillumination of the scrotum.</p><p>Testicular torsion that occurred prenatally presents with a firm, nontender testicle with discoloration of the scrotum. Size of the testicle will vary, depending on the extent of atrophy that has occurred prior to birth. In contrast, postnatal torsion presents with acute tenderness and swelling in a testicle that was previously noted to be normal on examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-testicular-torsion#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal testicular torsion&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The foreskin normally is tight or adherent in the newborn; easy retraction usually is not possible for several months to years. Some infants may have a small (1 mm) white sebaceous (epidermal) cyst at the tip of the foreskin that is benign.</p><p>The urethral meatus usually can be located without retraction of the foreskin. The position of the urethral meatus should be determined. Abnormalities of the position of the urethral meatus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypospadias &minus; Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly of the male urethra that results in abnormal ventral placement of the urethral opening.

Circumcision is usually not recommended, because either the preputial skin may be necessary for hypospadias repair or the lack of ventral skin makes circumcision difficult. A pediatric urologist should be consulted in the nursery if there is a question regarding performance of circumcision.

Ambiguous genitalia may signal an intersex disorder. These conditions also may be caused by abnormalities of sexual differentiation or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).</p><p>Infants with a suspected disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, including an endocrinologist, urologist, geneticist, and <span class=\"nowrap\">pediatrician/neonatologist</span>.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

It includes review of the maternal, family, and prenatal history and a complete examination.</p><p>The newborn history includes the review of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parent's medical and genetic history. In particular, any maternal illnesses prior to and during pregnancy and the use of maternal medications should be noted. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past pregnancies, including a history of congenital anomalies, still births, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic or syndromic conditions.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It generally begins with observation of the infant's general appearance, including <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> body position at rest, body movement, color, and respiratory effort. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'General appearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auscultation of the lung and heart typically follows, as the infant usually is lying quietly, which optimizes this portion of the examination.
