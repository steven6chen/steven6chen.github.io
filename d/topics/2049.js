A meta-analysis of genetic studies suggests that other biologic pathways are also involved in bipolar disorder, including cardiac &beta;-adrenergic signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling, corticotropin releasing hormone signaling, endothelin 1 signaling, glutamate signaling, and phospholipase C signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In addition, genes involved in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder may have pleiotropic effects and confer risk for other types of psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (33,332 patients with bipolar disorder, unipolar major depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, or attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and 27,888 controls) identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosomes 3 and 10 that were associated with all five disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One of the polymorphisms was located on a brain expressed gene that encodes calcium channel subunits; calcium signalling regulates neuronal growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2069682199\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ribonucleic acid sequencing of postmortem tissue from patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls indicates that gene expression is altered in bipolar disorder.

Epigenetic phenomena may involve environmental factors such as toxins (eg, metals and air pollutants) and early life experiences or chronic stress, which induce changes such as methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid and histone acetylation. </p><p>In addition, epigenetic changes may involve heritable (across cell division for an individual or from an individual to offspring) modifications of the genome that change gene expression without altering any DNA sequence. Evidence that implicates epigenetic factors in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder includes a study of postmortem hippocampus tissue from patients with bipolar disorder (n = 8) and matched healthy controls (n = 8) that found bipolar disorder was associated with specific methylation changes of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99692006\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that brain structure and function are altered in bipolar disorder.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging study of bipolar patients (n = 54, mean lifetime duration of illness of 24 years) found that after controlling for age, a longer duration of illness and a longer exposure to antipsychotic medication were each associated with smaller total gray matter volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619409501\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum markers of inflammation are increased in bipolar disorder and suggest that the disorder is associated with immune system dysregulation. One such biomarker is a group of signalling molecules called cytokines, which mediate both central and peripheral inflammation. Separate meta-analyses have each found that cytokines (eg, interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and cytokine receptors are elevated in patients with bipolar disorder, compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>Proinflammatory cytokines induce acute phase proteins such as C reactive protein.

Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally, and the mean age of onset is approximately 19 years.

However, family, twin, and adoption studies demonstrate that genetic factors are involved. In addition, altered brain structure and function are present in bipolar disorder; it is not clear whether these changes precede onset of bipolar disorder or represent its consequences.
