As a class, antipsychotics are also effective in the treatment of acute agitation, bipolar mania, and other psychiatric conditions. &#160;</p><p>First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), also known as neuroleptics, conventional or typical antipsychotics, have significant potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia. This propensity to cause movement disorders is the primary difference between FGAs and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). In other respects, such as other side effects and their mechanism of action, the two classes have substantial overlap and comparable efficacy.</p><p>The pharmacology,<strong> </strong>administration, and side effects of FGAs are discussed here. The pharmacology,<strong> </strong>administration, and side effects of SGAs are discussed separately. The efficacy and administration of antipsychotic drugs for specific psychotic disorders are also described separately, as are antipsychotic poisoning, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and other antipsychotic drug side effects.

Evidence supporting this mechanism includes strong antagonism of D2 receptors in both cortical and striatal areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a high correlation between D2 receptor binding and clinical potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and a consistent requirement of 65 percent D2 receptor occupancy for antipsychotic efficacy in functional imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The nonspecific localization of FGA dopamine binding throughout the central nervous system is consistent with their risk of movement disorders and prolactinemia. Aside from their common activity as D2 antagonists, each FGA has distinct effects on neuronal 5-HT2a, alpha-1, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors, which generally correspond to their individual side effect profiles, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16917418\"><span class=\"h2\">High and low potency FGAs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacologic differences described above are the basis for the classification of FGAs as either high- or low-potency drugs: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high-potency FGAs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loxapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thiothixene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiothixene</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trifluoperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trifluoperazine</a>) are dosed in the range of 1 to 10s of milligrams and have low activity at histaminic and muscarinic receptors.

FGAs are lipophilic, highly protein- and tissue-bound as a class with large volumes of distribution. Each of these factors varies substantially among patients, making it difficult to predict serum drug levels based on dose alone. Meaningful guidelines for therapeutic drug levels have been similarly elusive, even for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, the most widely studied of these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Each of these factors should be considered as the clinician assesses the patient&rsquo;s clinical response to an initial dose of the medication.</p><p>The most readily absorbed FGAs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loxapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a>, with times to peak serum concentration of one to three hours. Other drugs are less predictably absorbed. An oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, for example, may require anywhere from two to six hours to reach peak concentration. The intramuscular formulation of loxapine requires five hours to be fully absorbed, more than twice as long as its oral counterpart. Loxapine has the highest bioavailability among these drugs at nearly 100 percent, in contrast to haloperidol at 60 percent and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>&rsquo;s 20 percent. Predictable changes in bioavailability with food have not been reported with any of the drugs.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loxapine</a> has a unique aerosol formulation that reaches peak plasma concentration within two minutes following use, with little variation among subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical effect of the drug on psychotic agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar mania patients was reported within 10 minutes of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

This dependence on hepatic clearance makes the drugs susceptible to liver impairment and drug-drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H16917708\" class=\"local\">'Drug-drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>The CYP-2D6 gene is polymorphic and increased serum concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, as well as more prominent side effects, such as over-sedation, have been described among CYP-2D6 slow metabolizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>, the maximum daily dose should be reduced from 10 mg to 4 mg in slow metabolizers. No specific dose adjustments in slow or extensive metabolizers are recommended for other FGAs. Specific metabolic pathways used by individual drugs are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Most FGAs have clearance half-times of 20 to 40 hours, and several have active metabolites, factors that lead to relatively stable serum levels with once daily administration. Recommendations for more frequent dosing are usually based on side effect management rather than pharmacokinetics. The presence of active metabolites may complicate predictions of how long it will take a drug to be cleared, as in the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loxapine</a>, which has two active metabolites that give it more complex pharmacokinetics than other antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is favorable in the case of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a>&rsquo;s active metabolite, 7-hydroxyperphenazine, whose 19-hour clearance time gives the medication a longer duration of activity than the relative short clearance half-time of the parent compound would suggest. A possible negative effect has been suggested for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>&rsquo;s metabolite pyridinium, which has been cited as potentially neurotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pharmacokinetics of the FGAs are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16917708\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FGAs can interact with drugs that have potent effects on CYP metabolism, including the antidepressants <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, which inhibit CYP-3A4 and -2D6, and the mood stabilizer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, which strongly induces CYP-1A2 and -3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>). The impact of CYP induction or inhibition on serum levels of most FGAs is moderated somewhat in the drugs that have multiple pathways for clearance, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loxapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioridazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioridazine</a>. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluphenazine</a> has a single primary pathway via CYP-2D6 and is more susceptible to interactions with inhibitors of this enzyme than are other FGAs.

A patient who is stabilized on one of these drugs in a nonsmoking environment, such as a hospital, may experience a drop in serum levels upon returning home and resuming smoking. In each of these cases, a moderate dose increase may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/4,5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16917799\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral dosing of first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) is the preferred route of administration in most patients.

Once-daily dosing is indicated for most of the FGAs. More frequent administration may be useful in some cases to minimize side effects. Dosing at bedtime is generally preferred because of the sedation associated with the drugs, but exceptions for individual patients are common and the medications work equally well irrespective of the time of the dose.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loxapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Loxapine</a> is available for administration as a heat-generated aerosol of particles appropriate for deep lung delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The drug is given as a single inhaled dose that is absorbed rapidly and completely. This formulation is approved for once-daily dosing for control of psychotic agitation. (See <a href=\"#H16917445\" class=\"local\">'Absorption and bioavailability'</a> above.)</p><p>Intramuscular injectable formulations of antipsychotic drugs for acute indications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60846 \">table 3</a>) and long-acting injectable formulations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F59201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59201 \">table 4</a>) are discussed separately.

The choice of an antipsychotic is often influenced by its side effect profile and its match with the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and vulnerabilities. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sedating antipsychotic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, might be used for a patient with psychosis and insomnia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An antipsychotic associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, might be selected in a patient with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or obesity. </p><p/><p>Common side effects associated with FGAs include extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, QT prolongation, sudden death, and an increased risk of mortality when used to treat psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia in older adult patients.

As dopamine D2 antagonists, these drugs have the potential to interfere with dopamine transmission via the nigrostriatal tract, which is involved in control of muscle movement, thereby producing symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease.
