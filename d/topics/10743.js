Most heal well with conservative treatment, but some are associated with other significant injuries and careful evaluation is needed.</p><p>The evaluation and management of MCL injuries is reviewed here. A general approach to the patient with knee pain and the management of other types of knee injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lateral collateral ligament injury and related posterolateral corner injuries of the knee&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to one systematic review, studies of the epidemiology of knee injuries are deeply flawed and should be interpreted cautiously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, ligament injuries account for up to 40 percent of all knee injuries, and of these, medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries appear to be the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. MCL tears accounted for 7.9 percent of all injuries in an observational study of 19,530 knee injuries in 17,397 athletes over a 10 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The precise incidence of MCL injuries is unlikely to ever be known because many low grade injuries go unreported. While still common, MCL injuries declined in number during the course of an 11-year study of injuries in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Given the limitations of the medical literature, it is not possible to determine the exact risk of MCL injury by sport. Football (ie, soccer) and basketball players appear to have a relatively high prevalence, as do participants in contact sports such as wrestling, hockey, and rugby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Whether the risk of MCL injury varies significantly by gender remains unclear, some studies suggest that females are at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. A large survey study of United States high schools reported that females had a higher risk for knee injury than boys playing the same sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Data from a prospective study of cadet athletes at the United States Military Academy suggest a significantly higher risk for isolated MCL injury among female intercollegiate athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Other potential risk factors of note include prior injury, higher level of play (eg, intercollegiate athletes are at higher risk than secondary school athletes), game participation (versus practice), and type of sport. Various other risk factors have been proposed ranging from equipment (eg, ski bindings) to different shoe-surface interfaces, but no definitive data exist to confirm these claims. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury and healing'</a> below.)</p><p>MCL injuries are often accompanied by damage to other structures. Medial meniscal tears occur in up to 5 percent of MCL injuries, and trauma to other ligaments occurs in 20 to 78 percent of cases, depending upon the severity of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically important anatomy related to the medial collateral ligament (MCL, also referred to as the tibial collateral ligament) is described here. General anatomy of the knee is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>The MCL is part of the capsuloligamentous complex supporting the medial knee. This complex contains static (eg, capsule, ligaments) and dynamic (eg, muscles) structures. The dynamic stabilizers include the vastus medialis, semimembranosus, gracilis, and sartorius muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74251\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74251 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The MCL is approximately 8 to 10 cm long and shaped like an hour-glass. It originates from the medial femoral condyle anterior to the adductor tubercle and inserts on the anterior medial tibia just distal to the pes anserine on the tibial metaphysis. The MCL is well vascularized and innervated.</p><p>There are two accepted ways to describe the anatomy of the MCL and the medial knee. The classic description most referenced in the literature is based upon a series of 154 knee dissections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This study describes three layers of anatomy: the first and most superficial is deep sartorial fascia, the second includes the superficial MCL and posterior medial complex ligaments (including the posterior oblique ligament), and the third includes the deep MCL and posterior medial capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The deep MCL and posterior oblique ligaments have attachments to the medial meniscus. Therefore, the MCL and medial meniscus can be injured simultaneously. The superficial MCL has proximal and distal sections and the instability pattern seen in injury can depend on the location of the injury. Other important medial structures include the medial patella-femoral ligament, adductor magnus tendon, medial gastrocnemius tendon, and medial hamstring tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>An alternative description divides the medial structures of the knee into anterior, middle, and posterior thirds. The anterior third includes the capsular ligaments and retinaculum, the middle third includes the superficial and deep MCL, and the posterior third includes the posterior medial complex (including the posterior oblique and popliteal ligaments) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A bursa lies between the deep and superficial layers of the MCL.</p><p>Overall, the MCL and related medial structures provide restraint against valgus stress and tibial rotation.</p><p>Researchers note that the MCL fibers provide relatively consistent isometric tension throughout knee flexion and extension, and this helps resist valgus stress to the knee. However, there is no universal agreement about the degree to which such resistance occurs in knee flexion versus extension, or about the relative contributions of the superficial and deep MCL fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. The posterior oblique ligament assists in resisting the stresses at the knee that occur with internal rotation and extension. The anterior cruciate ligament provides a secondary restraint to valgus and rotational stress, particularly in full extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY AND HEALING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is commonly injured (or sprained) in contact and collision sports, as well as sports that require significant twisting and torque of the lower extremity, such as football (ie, soccer), basketball, tennis, and skiing. The ligament may be injured via a direct valgus stress from a blow to the lateral aspect of the knee or via an indirect stress through abduction or rotation of the lower leg. Direct blows typically cause more severe injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A study of injuries sustained over an 11 year period conducted by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) found that MCL injuries were more likely to be caused by contact, and more commonly associated with foul play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Injury through an indirect mechanism typically occurs when a shoe catches on a playing surface (eg, cleat catches on turf, sneaker adheres to a court surface) while the athlete is trying to change direction quickly. A similar force is generated when an athlete catches a tip or the inside edge of a ski or skate. This results in a valgus stress at the knee, often with external tibial rotation. The MCL may also be injured if the knee is forced into hyperextension. This can cause injury to multiple ligaments and, sometimes, the peroneal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>MCL injuries heal in classic stages: hemorrhage, inflammation, repair, and remodeling. Scar tissue may form, with the amount of scarring depending upon both the degree and the location of the injury. In animal models, injury to the midsubstance of the MCL seems to demonstrate better healing than injury to the proximal or distal ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general knee examination is described separately. Aspects of the examination of particular importance for assessment of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) are described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of an injured knee is best accomplished within 20 or 30 minutes of the injury, before pain, swelling, and muscle spasm make assessment difficult. Often, the examination cannot be performed in this time frame. In some cases, it is best to provide symptomatic treatment and have the patient return for reevaluation once symptoms have subsided.</p><p>The patient must be relaxed for the knee to be examined properly. This can be accomplished by having the patient concentrate on relaxing their hip muscles, providing adequate support for the injured limb throughout the examination, monitoring tension in the hamstrings, and performing examination maneuvers gently.</p><p>Examine the knee systematically. Begin with the uninjured knee and compare findings in the uninjured and injured joints.</p><p>Be sure to look for other injuries that may occur in association with an MCL sprain, particularly those of greater severity. These include injuries to the meniscus, distal femur or proximal tibia, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior oblique ligament, adjacent muscles, and the peroneal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H421084103\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observe the patient's stance and gait. Inability to bear weight suggests the presence of a significant injury necessitating imaging. Clinical guidelines that help to determine when such imaging is necessary are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H1700819050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>The knee should be inspected carefully for swelling, ecchymosis, and deformity. While localized swelling can develop, joint effusions are <strong>not</strong> common in isolated MCL sprains, particularly with lower grade injuries. More severe MCL sprains often involve concomitant injuries, such as meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament tears, which can cause a joint effusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation is important for diagnosing MCL sprain and ruling out associated injuries (eg, avulsion fracture, tibial plateau fracture, and muscle, tendon, or ligament damage). Palpate bony and soft tissues, noting areas of tenderness, warmth, and crepitance.</p><p>Bony landmarks to palpate include the joint lines (medial, posterior medial corner, posterior, and lateral), femoral condyles, tibial plateau, patella and patellar facets, tibial tubercle, tibial metaphysis, and the pes anserine area.</p><p>Soft tissues to palpate include the entire length of the MCL as well as the patellar retinaculum, patellar and quadriceps tendons, extensor mechanism, and adjacent muscles, including the gracilis, sartorius, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, medial gastrocnemius, and quadriceps.</p><p>Although rigorous studies are lacking, focal tenderness over a segment of the MCL is reported to be up to 78 percent accurate in diagnosing the location of an MCL tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, it is often difficult to distinguish a midsubstance MCL tear from an injury to the medial meniscus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perform range of motion testing using the following sequence: active, passive, and then resisted. The cardinal motions of the knee are flexion and extension. Typical range of motion for the knee ranges from several degrees of recurvatum (ie, past full extension) to 140 degrees of flexion, but actual ranges vary widely among patients. Therefore, it is important to compare the injured and uninjured knees.</p><p>Assess the knee for its full range of motion, noting the ease with which it moves and any limits to mobility. Also note any pain and where in the arc of knee movement pain occurs.</p><p>Passive range of motion need not be assessed if active range of motion is full and unrestricted. If active motion is limited, assess passive mobility. While doing so, apply gentle pressure, thereby compressing the knee joint, to determine if a true block to motion exists. A true block suggests the presence of an intraarticular derangement, such as an intraarticular loose body or a torn and displaced meniscus. Pain from an isolated MCL injury can limit active motion, particularly terminal knee extension and flexion beyond 100 degrees, but generally does not constrain passive motion.</p><p>Resisted motion is performed last with the patient seated and the knee in neutral position (90 degrees of flexion). Note the level of strength and any pain with isometric contraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests and grade of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perform a valgus (or abduction) stress test with the knee in both 30 degrees and 0 degrees of flexion looking for joint laxity. Baseline joint laxity varies widely so it is important to compare the injured and uninjured knees.</p><p>A valgus stress test is performed with the patient supine, the hip in slight flexion and abduction, and the knee slightly flexed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89638\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef89638 \">movie 1</a>). The test can be performed in the following manner. Secure the leg by pinning the patient's ankle or foot between your elbow and the side of your body. Next, place both hands on the patient's proximal lower leg with your fingers over the medial and lateral joint lines. Exert a gentle valgus stress across the knee joint by pushing on the ankle or foot with your elbow, while holding the proximal leg in place with your hands. As you exert this gentle valgus stress, feel how much the medial joint line widens.</p><p>If the valgus stress test reveals laxity at approximately 30 degrees of flexion, the superficial portion of the MCL may be injured. Laxity at 0 degrees of flexion suggests injury to the deeper structures of the MCL, and possible disruption of a cruciate ligament (the anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] and posterior cruciate ligament [PCL] act as secondary restraints to valgus stress). Both the posterior medial corner and posterior oblique ligament may be damaged when MCL and ACL injuries coexist. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Assessing joint stability'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Lachman test is the most reliable examination maneuver for assessing the integrity of the ACL in this setting. A pivot shift test may be inaccurate if a complete tear of the MCL exists. These tests are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of joint opening and the presence or absence of a distinct endpoint when performing a valgus stress examination determines the grade of MCL injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade I</strong> &mdash; Less than 5 mm of joint opening accompanied by a solid endpoint represents a Grade I (or mild) injury. In such cases, a few fibers are torn, but the MCL is structurally intact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade II</strong> &mdash; Anywhere from 5 to 9 mm of joint opening represents a Grade II (or moderate) injury. Usually a firm or perceptible endpoint is present. This suggests an incomplete MCL tear with some remaining ligamentous integrity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade III</strong> &mdash; 10 mm or more of joint opening with no perceptible endpoint indicates a Grade III (or significant) injury. This is a complete tear. In addition, this degree of laxity suggests that other knee ligaments may be injured.</p><p/><p>Rotational instability of the tibia can be assessed by externally rotating the foot with one hand, while palpating the joint line with the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If increased rotation compared to the uninjured knee is noted, this suggests anteromedial instability due to an injury of the deep MCL and possible injury to the posteromedial corner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In larger patients, rotational stability can be assessed by keeping the patient's thighs on the table and allowing the knee and foot to drop over the edge. The examiner then compares the degree of joint opening while applying a rotational stress to the injured and uninjured knees.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs are generally not necessary in the evaluation of an isolated medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury. However, they can be helpful in certain situations and are indicated in the setting of major trauma. In the skeletally immature patient, plain radiographs enable assessment of the physis.</p><p>Radiographs should be obtained if the patient is unable to bear weight or if focal bony tenderness, gross deformity, or an effusion is present. The Ottawa knee rules provide guidance for determining when imaging is necessary in the setting of knee trauma. Clinical guidelines that help to determine when such imaging is necessary are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-knee-pain-likely-of-musculoskeletal-origin#H1700819050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with knee pain likely of musculoskeletal origin&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-acutely-painful-knee-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the acutely painful knee in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>When radiographs are deemed necessary, the following views should be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior-posterior (AP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patellar (45 degree flexion)</p><p/><p>In some cases, a tunnel view may be helpful. Stress views can help identify joint opening, particularly in patients with a Grade III MCL tear or injuries to multiple knee ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50190\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50190 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The Pellegrini-Stieda sign is a calcification (usually crescent-shaped) of the MCL at the medial femoral condyle and is associated with chronic injury or insufficiency of the MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The calcification may cause focal pain but is not associated with specific clinical findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is seldom necessary to assess minor (ie, isolated) MCL injuries. MRI can be used to define the extent of a severe MCL injury and to look for associated injuries (eg, anterior cruciate ligament tear) if the physical examination is limited or major knee trauma is suspected. Although injury severity can be categorized into three grades based on MRI findings, such grading this does not correlate well with clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. MRI is perhaps most useful for assessing a clinical Grade III injury, as it can sometimes distinguish the superficial and deep layers of the MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This distinction may determine the need for surgery, particularly if there is entrapment of the deep MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].</p><p>MRI findings typically include bursal swelling between the deep and superficial layers, subcutaneous soft tissue swelling, and hemorrhage and tearing of MCL fibers. Fiber damage ranges from internal derangement to complete disruption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69553 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66992\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66992 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81676\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81676 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61894\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61894 \">image 5</a>). Other MRI findings may include hemarthrosis, contusion of the lateral femoral condyles or the tibial plateau, meniscal injury, damage to other ligaments, and (rarely) partial avulsion of the medial femoral condyle. Typically, coronal sequences provide the best visualization of the MCL and posterior medial corner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Various clinical entities that may masquerade as an MCL injury on MRI include bursitis, osteoarthritis, retinaculum injury, and medial meniscus cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary observational studies and anecdotal reports suggest that bedside ultrasound is a useful tool for assessing MCL tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25</a>]. Ultrasound identifies MCL lesions on the basis of abnormal sonographic appearance and quantitative assessment of joint opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F94250\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94250 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F94251\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef94251 \">movie 2</a>). Larger, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421084225\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury is made clinically based upon the history, clinical presentation, and examination findings and is generally straightforward. The mechanism typically involves a direct blow to the knee (usually the lateral knee) or a shoe catching while the athlete is attempting to change direction suddenly; common examination findings include focal tenderness over the MCL and a positive valgus stress test. Clinicians facile with ultrasound may use this technique to confirm the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to establish a definitive diagnosis but is rarely necessary except in cases of severe trauma or when a major concomitant injury is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H421084103\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain is made clinically and is generally straightforward. However, the examiner should be alert to other potential injuries, particularly to the anterior cruciate ligament, trauma to which frequently accompanies higher grade MCL tears. Typically, knee injuries involving multiple ligaments present with significant joint swelling and instability. The diagnosis may be missed if the patient presents several days or weeks after the inciting event.

The mechanism usually involves major trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision or high-speed sports) and results in a large hemarthrosis and abnormal knee alignment. Of note, knee dislocations can spontaneously reduce prior to medical evaluation making diagnosis difficult.

Patients with an isolated MCL injury and significant knee instability that persists despite proper conservative treatment should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. Consultation is advised if a posteromedial corner injury is suspected, as these injuries may have a better outcome with surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Otherwise, most experts agree that surgery for MCL repair is indicated only for some patients with major concomitant injuries.</p><p>Emergent surgical referral is mandatory for any open fracture, neurovascular deficit, or suspected tibiofemoral dislocation. Keep in mind that tibiofemoral dislocations can reduce spontaneously prior to evaluation; suspect the injury in any patient with a highly unstable knee following significant trauma. Patients who have sustained high velocity trauma (eg, automobile accident, downhill skiing at high speed) are best evaluated in the emergency department.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications for consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Ice can be applied for approximately 20 minutes every two to three hours for two or three days following the injury. Gentle compression with an elastic bandage and protected motion using a brace and crutches are often helpful. Weight bearing is as tolerated. A brief period in a functional or hinged brace is preferable to a straight-leg knee immobilizer because the latter can result in joint stiffness.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> is commonly used for acute pain control and appears to have no adverse effect upon healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used for analgesia following an acute MCL injury. While NSAIDs provide effective short-term pain relief, their effect on ligament and bone healing remains unclear. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Possible effect on tendon injury'</a>.)</p><p>The goals of early treatment of any ligament injury are to regain mobility and function while protecting the injured joint. This enables the patient to return to activity as rapidly and as safely as possible.</p><p>Animal models have demonstrated weaker ligament healing and poorer outcomes in immobilized joints and clinical trials support this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Casting and surgery, once the standard approach to MCL treatment, provide no benefit. Observational data and clinical studies of rehabilitation of ligamentous injuries of the ankle demonstrate that early motion improves ligament healing and strength. Thus, early mobilization has become a fundamental principle of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Temporary bracing may be needed to support unstable joints during ambulation, but prolonged immobilization of any type is to be avoided in MCL injuries of all grades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND REHABILITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial examination of the medial collateral ligament (MCL), particularly if the patient presents several days after the injury, may be limited by swelling and pain. In such cases, we generally reexamine the patient within one week to determine the presence of associated injuries and the need for further imaging, referral, or bracing, and to begin the rehabilitation process.</p><p>It may be best to have the patient evaluated in the emergency department if the injury involved a high velocity mechanism (eg, automobile accident, downhill skiing at high speed) or tibiofemoral dislocation may have occurred. The timing of subsequent follow-up appointments is dictated by the severity of the injury, use of bracing, and the patient's recovery. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications for consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, early joint motion is a central concept of rehabilitation and is encouraged in patients with an MCL injury. Weight bearing and activity are advanced as tolerated by the patient.</p><p>Bracing, while commonly recommended, is controversial. If bracing is deemed necessary, usually for pain relief, a hinged knee brace is best. Brace settings should allow for as much flexion as the patient can tolerate but should prevent full extension. Typically, the extension stop is set at 10 to 20 degrees of flexion. If the knee has a valgus deformity, more extensive bracing may be needed to mitigate valgus forces across the injured ligament. More extensive bracing entails using a brace that extends further (both proximally on the thigh and distally on the leg) and wearing it more often.</p><p>Rehabilitation of an MCL injury is similar to other musculoskeletal injuries. The first goal is to restore active range of motion. Next, a gradual progression of exercises is used to improve strength, proprioception, agility, and general fitness. Finally, athletes perform sports-specific activities and return to play. This approach is sometimes referred to as functional rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A typical progression of strengthening exercises for the MCL-injured knee begins with isometric quadriceps contractions and progresses to isotonic exercises through a short arc (eg, quarter squat). Gradually, the range of motion and resistance for these exercises is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The progression of general activity begins with walking, moves to jogging as tolerated, then progresses to three-quarters speed, then straight ahead sprinting, then to movement in multiple directions (sprinting with curves to figure 8 running to side-to-side bounding), and finally to sports specific drills and return to competition.</p><p/><p>While these general principles can easily be taught in the office, the guidance of a physical therapist, athletic trainer, or other knowledgeable professional is often useful.</p><p>Multiple prospective observational studies attest to the effectiveness and decreased morbidity (primarily decreased range of motion) of this approach to rehabilitation for isolated MCL injuries when compared to surgical repair or immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral hinged braces and functional rehabilitation were used as part of the treatment protocol for American football players with severe (Grade III) MCL injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medial-collateral-ligament-injury-of-the-knee/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The MCL is injured most often through a direct valgus stress from a blow to the lateral aspect of the knee or through an indirect stress through abduction or rotation of the lower leg. Direct blows typically cause more severe injury.
