These findings have been observed in nearly every arterial bed. The most frequently involved arteries are the renal and internal carotid arteries, followed by the vertebral, visceral, and external iliac arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Disease presentation may vary widely, depending upon the arterial segment involved and the severity of disease.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of FMD in adults are reviewed here. The treatment of FMD and the general evaluation for possible renovascular hypertension and stroke are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with FMD have involvement of the renal arteries approximately 75 to 80 percent of the time and involvement of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries (eg, carotid and vertebral arteries) approximately 75 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of patients have multiple arteries involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Among adults, FMD is more common among females. In most large series, approximately 90 percent of cases are in women. There does <strong>not</strong> appear to be a female predominance among children with FMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the past, it was believed that FMD was a disease of young women. However, older individuals account for a large proportion of affected patients in several cohorts. As an example, in the United States FMD Registry, the mean age at diagnosis was 52 years, with a range of 5 to 86 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with renovascular hypertension, FMD accounts for 35 to 50 percent of cases in children and 5 to 10 percent of cases in adults under the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. It can also occur in older patients, either in isolation or in combination with atherosclerosis, but the prevalence is not well described. Approximately 65 percent of patients with renal artery FMD also have carotid or vertebral FMD, and, similarly, patients with carotid or vertebral FMD are likely to have renal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>FMD of the renal arteries can be an incidental finding. In a synthesis of four angiographic studies, for example, 139 of 3181 asymptomatic potential kidney donors (4.4 percent) had evidence for FMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of incidentally discovered FMD was even higher in the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although FMD was an exclusion criterion for enrollment in this trial, and all patients presumably had atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, incidental evidence for FMD was discovered in 5.7 percent of the total study population, including 8.8 percent of the women who were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracranial cerebrovascular (eg, carotid and vertebral arteries) involvement is common in patients with established renal FMD. Data from the first 447 patients entered into the United States FMD Registry reveal that approximately 65 percent have extracranial cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Older literature indicated that carotid artery involvement was present in only 25 to 30 percent of patients with FMD. However, it was not previously standard practice to image other vascular beds when renal artery FMD was diagnosed, possibly accounting for these historical lower-prevalence estimates. Asymptomatic extracranial cerebrovascular disease is discovered more commonly now that every patient diagnosed with renal artery FMD routinely undergoes imaging of other vascular beds.</p><p>When cerebrovascular disease is present, there is often bilateral carotid involvement, coexisting vertebral artery disease, and, less commonly, disease in the external carotid, middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, basilar, and anterior communicating arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>]. FMD may also be associated with intracranial aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p>FMD of the visceral arteries is less common and typically involves the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, hepatic, and splenic arteries. In the lower extremities, FMD occurs most frequently in the external iliac arteries, although it also has been described in the femoral, popliteal, and tibioperoneal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In the upper extremities, FMD is identified most frequently in the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, FMD was classified according to the arterial layer affected (intima, media, or adventitia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, pathological specimens are rarely obtained (due to the fact that, if a lesion requires treatment, percutaneous endovascular therapy is the preferred method rather than surgery). Thus, because FMD is virtually always diagnosed radiographically and histology is not typically available, pathological classification has been replaced by an angiographic classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54161 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41439717\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiographic classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMD is most commonly classified by angiographic appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54161 \">table 1</a>). There are two angiographic subtypes of FMD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal FMD (more common) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100114 \">image 1</a>) has the angiographic appearance of a &quot;string of beads.&quot; Multifocal FMD corresponds pathologically to medial fibroplasia, the most common histologic type, and to perimedial fibroplasia, which is less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal FMD (less common) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100116\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100116 \">image 2</a>) has the angiographic appearance of a &quot;circumferential or tubular stenosis&quot; and corresponds pathologically to intimal fibroplasia. Medial hyperplasia and periarterial hyperplasia are histologic types that may also have a focal appearance.</p><p/><p>It has been shown that these two different angiographic subtypes of FMD (multifocal and focal) have different phenotypic presentations and natural history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This has led some investigators to question whether FMD is, in fact, a single disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41439805\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMD is not usually classified histologically because pathological specimens are rarely obtained. In the past, fibrous lesions were classified according to the arterial layer affected (intima, media, or adventitia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54161 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial fibroplasia represents the most common dysplastic lesion, accounting for more than 80 percent of fibromuscular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Angiographically, medial fibroplasia is characterized by the classic &quot;string of beads&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100114 \">image 1</a>). This appearance is due to alternating fibromuscular webs and aneurysmal dilatation. In areas of dilatation, the internal elastic lamina is absent, which is possibly the primary defect. Total occlusion is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intimal fibroplasia (which accounts for approximately 10 percent of FMD) is caused by circumferential or eccentric deposition of collagen in the intima (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100116\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100116 \">image 2</a>). The internal elastic lamina may be intact, fragmented, or duplicated, the latter especially in the childhood form. There is no inflammatory or lipid component.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In perimedial fibroplasia, which occurs predominately in children, large parts of the media (in particular, the outer zone) are replaced by collagen, with irregular thickening of the media. Total occlusion may occur with development of collateral vasculature. &quot;Beading&quot; is present in this type, but the &quot;beads&quot; are less numerous and are smaller than in medial fibroplasia. Aneurysm formation is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial hyperplasia, a rare manifestation, is caused by smooth muscle cell hyperplasia without fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periarterial hyperplasia, also a rare manifestation, is caused by expansion of the fibrous adventitia; collagen extends into the periarterial fat, with accompanying inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of FMD remains unknown. Although a variety of factors have been implicated, most investigators now believe that genetics play an important role in the development of FMD, with some studies reporting an autosomal mode of inheritance with variable penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Another study found an association between FMD and a single nucleotide variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (<em>PHACTR1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This variant, rs9349379, is also a risk locus for coronary artery disease, migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Given the predominance in women of childbearing age, hormonal influences are thought to also be important in the pathogenesis of FMD, yet there are no definitive studies. It is also possible that mechanical factors such as stretching of smooth muscle cells and trauma to the blood vessel wall may initiate the changes seen in FMD, but this theory has never been proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease manifestations may result from the following mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia related to stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection and occlusion of major arteries (renal infarction, stroke, myocardial infarction)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture of aneurysms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolization of intravascular thrombi from dissection or aneurysms</p><p/><p>Thus, disease presentation may vary widely, depending upon the arterial segment involved, the length and degree of stenosis, and the angiographic class of FMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122907093\"><span class=\"h2\">Common presenting symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of FMD varies somewhat in men as compared with women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In general, manifestations of renal FMD (eg, hypertension, flank pain) are more likely to occur in men, as are arterial dissections and aneurysms. By contrast, manifestations of cerebrovascular FMD (eg, headache, pulsatile tinnitus, neck pain, carotid bruit) are more likely to occur in women.</p><p>The most common presenting symptoms in 615 individuals from the United States FMD Registry are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; 57 percent (58 percent of women and 47 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulsatile tinnitus &ndash; 33 percent (36 percent of women and 9 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck pain &ndash; 27 percent (29 percent of women and 13 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flank or abdominal pain &ndash; 17 percent (14 percent of women and 44 percent of men)</p><p/><p>The most common presenting signs of FMD are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension &ndash; 67 percent (66 percent of women and 74 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical bruit &ndash; 25 percent (27 percent of women and 4 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal bruit &ndash; 11 percent (12 percent of women and no men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attack &ndash; 10 percent (10 percent of women and 4 percent of men)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke &ndash; 8 percent (8 percent of women and 4 percent of men)</p><p/><p>Headache, pulsatile tinnitus, and neck pain are typically symptoms of extracranial cerebrovascular FMD, usually caused by stenosis, aneurysm rupture, dissection, or cerebral thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/16,17,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,30-33</a>]. Other manifestations suggestive of brain ischemia may occur, including amaurosis fugax, Horner's syndrome, and, as noted above, transient ischemic attack or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Brain ischemia is almost always related to a dissection of the carotid or vertebral artery.</p><p>Hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal artery FMD. A decrease in renal perfusion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which has direct effects on sodium excretion, sympathetic nerve activity, intrarenal prostaglandin concentrations, and nitric oxide production. These ultimately lead to renovascular hypertension. Flank pain and abdominal pain can result from ischemia, aneurysm rupture, or dissection of renal and mesenteric arteries, respectively.</p><p>Chronic mesenteric ischemia or intestinal angina may occur when two of the splanchnic arteries are occluded and the third is severely stenotic. Occasionally, mesenteric ischemia may occur with superior mesenteric artery stenosis alone, although extensive collaterals in the mesenteric circulation generally prevent ischemia when only one splanchnic vessel is occluded. Patients may present with the classic triad of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and an epigastric bruit. In rare cases, the stenosis progresses to total occlusion, resulting in acute intestinal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2293858809\"><span class=\"h3\">Less common manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with lower-extremity FMD may present with intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia, or microembolism that manifests as painful, cyanotic toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A noninvasive imaging test is usually performed first. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is performed in patients if there is a high clinical suspicion of FMD, and treatment with revascularization is planned if a stenosis is found. A negative DSA excludes a diagnosis of FMD in the vascular bed that was imaged. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Choice of diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>As noted above, the angiographic appearance of FMD falls into the following classes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54161 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H41439717\" class=\"local\">'Angiographic classification'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal FMD &ndash; Imaging may reveal a beaded appearance to the affected artery (ie, &quot;string of beads&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100114 \">image 1</a>). Most commonly, beads are numerous and are larger than the diameter of the vessel. Less commonly (typically in children with FMD), beads are few and are smaller than the diameter of the vessel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal FMD &ndash; Imaging may reveal a concentric, smooth, band-like focal stenosis or a tubular stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F100116\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100116 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p>In addition to the multifocal arterial beading or focal stenosis that can occur with FMD, patients with FMD may have extreme arterial tortuosity. This is most common in the carotid, vertebral, and coronary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101255\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101255 \">image 3</a>), and occurs more frequently in patients with FMD than in age- and sex-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44</a>]. This tortuosity is not specific for FMD, and its consequence in patients with FMD is unknown.</p><p>Histopathology (and histologic classification) is <strong>no longer</strong> part of the diagnosis. Histopathology of FMD lesions is performed only in the rare patient who requires surgical revascularization or resection of an aneurysm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FMD is most frequently diagnosed using noninvasive imaging tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>], specifically computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or duplex ultrasonography, and less frequently by catheter-based DSA.</p><p>Choosing a noninvasive imaging technique depends upon the expertise of a given institution but is also influenced by the vascular bed that is presumed to be involved. While duplex ultrasound is an excellent technique for the carotid, vertebral, and renal arteries, it has the lowest special resolution of all of the cross-sectional imaging modalities and has the most operator dependence. Thus, while there are some centers who use this as initial screening, for most centers, either CTA or MRA would be a better diagnostic choice. CTA is preferable due to higher spatial resolution than MRA, less dependence upon technical expertise, and a shorter scan time. In addition, MRA may miss FMD if the FMD is mild.</p><p>Although noninvasive imaging techniques are usually sufficient to diagnose FMD, catheter-based DSA, which is the reference standard, can improve visualization of the arteries by eliminating background soft tissue and bone and has higher spatial resolution than any of the other imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>When performed, DSA can also be used to measure the pressure gradient across the stenosis; a pressure decrease threshold (using a pressure wire) of 10 percent or more of the mean pressure should be used to decide whether a lesion is hemodynamically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be helpful in determining if a dissection or intramural hematoma is present as well as help to determine if angioplasty has improved the stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Duplex ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal artery duplex ultrasound can detect elevated blood flow velocities in the mid and distal portions of the artery, the most common locations for FMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/3,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,45</a>]. Ultrasound results are most helpful if they report an increased peak systolic velocity, turbulent blood flow, and tortuosity of the mid and distal artery. Reports that assign a percent diameter stenosis of the artery are less helpful since such statements are usually inaccurate.</p><p>Duplex of the extracranial cerebrovascular arteries is also useful in patients with FMD because newer ultrasound equipment and techniques permit visualization of the carotid and vertebral arteries up to the point where they enter the skull base.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multirow detector CTA has excellent diagnostic accuracy for FMD of the main renal arteries, although the sensitivity decreases when FMD is only present in the smaller branch renal arteries. In one study, in which CTA reconstructions (including multiplanar reformatted images, maximum intensity projections, and axial images) were evaluated in patients with known FMD, CTA detected FMD lesions in 100 percent of 37 arteries studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Multirow detector CT scanners, which offer more rapid image acquisition, variable section thickness, three-dimensional rendering, diminished helical artifacts, and smaller contrast requirements, may gain an increased role in the diagnosis and follow-up of renal artery FMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRA offers inconsistent detection of FMD, and is a less preferred option if CTA and duplex ultrasonography are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/4,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,46</a>]. In one series, for example, the sensitivity was only 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The spatial resolution in the branch vessels is not adequate, and artifact may occur, suggesting &quot;beading&quot; when none is present. However, MRA can be useful for detecting aneurysms and dissections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The conditions that most commonly mimic the presentation of FMD are atherosclerotic vascular disease and vasculitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both atherosclerosis and FMD may cause renal artery stenosis and carotid artery disease. Patients with atherosclerosis are usually older and have typical cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and a history of tobacco use, whereas individuals with FMD are usually younger and have fewer cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, given that FMD can occur in older patients, age alone does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Atherosclerosis usually involves the ostial or proximal segment of the arteries, whereas FMD involves the middle or distal segment. In addition, the &quot;string of beads&quot; appearance is unique to FMD. Thus, atherosclerotic disease and FMD can typically be distinguished radiographically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multisystem involvement is observed in both vasculitis and FMD. Unlike patients with a vasculitic process, those with FMD generally will not have associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, or abnormalities of acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein), given that it is a noninflammatory process. An exception might be in the setting of an acute infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other possibilities that may be initially considered before renal artery FMD is diagnosed include primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) and any of the potential causes of secondary hypertension. When appropriate, an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension should identify the presence of FMD. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'History'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Testing for secondary hypertension'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DISEASE PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient who is being treated medically (eg, not eligible for or refusing intervention) should have monitoring of the blood pressure response to antihypertensive therapy and serum creatinine levels every three months initially, and, if the blood pressure stabilizes, the annual exams may then be performed. The decision against revascularization may need to change if hypertension is treatment resistant or if there is progressive loss of kidney function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries&quot;, section on 'Antihypertensive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Noninvasive imaging tests, such as duplex ultrasound, should be obtained every 6 to 12 months. Since radiation exposure is high, computed tomography angiography (CTA) should only be repeated if there is a strong clinical suspicion regarding the progression of the disease. If the patient has an aneurysm, he or she can be followed with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to follow the size of the aneurysm. However, assessing disease progression by angiographic criteria may be difficult, especially with medial fibroplasia, where it is hard to gauge the degree of stenosis.</p><p>Some reports suggest that disease progression may be better monitored by measuring the renal parenchyma. Compared with patients who have primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), patients with unilateral renal FMD had significantly decreased mean cortical thickness and reduced renal length as determined by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the contralateral, unaffected kidney, cortical thickness was also markedly decreased, although renal length was preserved. Atrophic changes in the renal parenchyma by ultrasound generally represent chronic ischemic damage and are not reversed after renal revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic disorder that leads to arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, dissection, and arterial tortuosity. It has been observed in nearly every arterial bed. The most frequently involved arteries are the renal (75 to 80 percent of patients), internal carotid, and vertebral arteries (approximately 75 percent of patients have carotid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertebral involvement), followed by visceral and external iliac arteries. Among adults, FMD is more common among females (approximately 90 percent of cases are in women). There does not appear to be a female predominance among children with FMD. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FMD is virtually always diagnosed radiographically, and histology is not typically available.

Medial hyperplasia and periarterial hyperplasia are histologic types that may also have a focal appearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting signs and symptoms of FMD include hypertension, headache, pulsatile tinnitus, neck pain, and cervical bruit. Other presenting signs and symptoms can include flank or abdominal pain, an abdominal bruit, transient ischemic attack, and stroke. These disease manifestations may result from ischemia related to stenosis, dissection, and occlusion of arteries, rupture of aneurysms, or embolization of intravascular thrombi.
