It is commonly associated with impairments in social and occupational functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is among the most disabling and economically catastrophic medical disorders, ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten illnesses contributing to the global burden of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Characteristics of schizophrenia typically include positive symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, disorganized speech; negative symptoms, such as a flat affect or poverty of speech; and impairments in cognition, including attention, memory and executive functions. A diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on the presence of such symptoms, coupled with social or occupational dysfunction, for at least six months in the absence of another diagnosis that would better account for the presentation.</p><p>This topic discusses clinical manifestations, assessment, diagnosis, and course of schizophrenia. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia are discussed separately. Anxiety, depression, and substance abuse in schizophrenia are discussed separately. The treatments for schizophrenia are discussed separately, as are other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenia in children is also reviewed separately.

People with schizophrenia generally present with several symptom domains (ie, areas of distinct psychopathology): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood and anxiety symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284546\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This group of symptoms includes the reality distortion symptoms of hallucinations and delusions, as well as disorganized thoughts and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29948555\"><span class=\"h3\">Hallucinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hallucinations are defined as the perception of a sensory process in the absence of an external source. They can be auditory, visual, somatic, olfactory, or gustatory.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auditory hallucinations are the most common form of hallucination, with prevalence estimates between 40 and 80 percent in people with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Although auditory hallucinations are frequently voices, they can also take the form of other sounds such as music, body noises, or machinery. Some people with schizophrenia describe the sounds as coming from inside their head, whereas others can point to a specific external location from which they emanate. Auditory hallucinations are often the manifestation of the illness most responsive to antipsychotic medication. Many people with schizophrenia report antipsychotics &ldquo;turn down the volume&rdquo; of these hallucinations such that they can cope with them better. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual hallucinations are often unformed, such as glowing orbs or flashes of color. However, some people with schizophrenia describe fully formed human figures, faces, or body parts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic hallucinations can include feelings of being touched, of sexual intercourse, or of pain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have not been systematically studied, but occasional patients will report a strange taste or smell.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29948685\"><span class=\"h3\">Delusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delusions, defined as a fixed (ie, resistant to change, even in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence), false belief, are present in approximately 80 percent of people with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because insight into their illness may be impaired, people with schizophrenia often have delusional explanations for their hallucinations. Delusions are broadly categorized as bizarre or non-bizarre although the distinction is less important in the current diagnostic rubric. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bizarre delusions are clearly implausible, ie, they have no possibility of being true (eg, contradict the laws of physics). Their content is not understandable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Basic concepts may be described in an unusual way, eg, how the person experiences time, space, the self, or causality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An example of a bizarre delusion is the belief that aliens have cloned a perfect body for the patient, but he must find a way to take off his head so that his spirit can flow into the new body. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A non-bizarre delusion is one that while not true is understandable and has the possibility of being true. An example is that the IRS is after the patient for not paying taxes.</p><p/><p>The content of delusions can often be categorized as ideas of reference, grandiose, paranoid, nihilistic, and erotomanic. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Ideas/delusions</span> of reference are beliefs that random or neutral events are not random or neutral, but include the individual in a special way. Common ideas of reference include believing that occurrences on the television or radio (certain words said or songs played) are meant to deliver a special message to the individual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grandiose delusions form around the belief that the person has some special significance or power.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paranoid delusions are clinically important, because they may prevent the individual from cooperating with evaluation or treatment, and because they may increase the likelihood of problems, such as homelessness, as the person goes &ldquo;off the grid.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nihilistic delusions are uncommon, bizarre beliefs that one is dead or one&rsquo;s body is breaking down or that one does not exist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In erotomanic delusions, the person erroneously believes that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has a special relationship with someone. These delusions can lead to legal problems, such as restraining orders and trespass charges.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284560\"><span class=\"h3\">Disorganization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schizophrenia is a thought disorder. People with schizophrenia typically display some disorganization in behavior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thinking. Disorganized behaviors are directly observed while disorganized thoughts must be inferred from the speech of the person. Disjointed, disconnected speech patterns reflect a disruption in the organization of person&rsquo;s thoughts. The most commonly observed forms of abnormal speech are tangentiality and circumstantiality, while more severe thought disorder includes derailment, neologisms, and word salad. The symptoms of disorganization are independent of the severity of hallucinations or [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tangential speech &ndash; The person gets increasingly further off the topic without appropriately answering a question.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumstantial speech &ndash; The person will eventually answer a question, but in a markedly roundabout manner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Derailment &ndash; The person suddenly switches topic without any logic or segue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neologisms &ndash; The creation of new, idiosyncratic words.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Word salad &ndash; Words are thrown together without any sensible meaning. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284567\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While positive symptoms represent an exaggeration of normal processes, negative symptoms are conceptualized as an absence or diminution of normal processes. Negative symptoms may be primary or secondary.</p><p>Primary, enduring negative symptoms represent a core feature of schizophrenia; they are also referred to as deficit symptoms. Examples of negative symptoms include decreased expressiveness, apathy, flat affect, and a lack of energy. Independent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">primary/secondary</span> distinction, negative symptoms appear to cluster into two components: a diminished expression symptom cluster and an avolition-apathy cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The recognition of the existence of these two clusters may facilitate the delineation of the pathophysiology of this illness component and lead to the development of novel therapeutics. A table lists negative symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F81542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81542 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Primary negative symptoms are very resistant to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>] and closely related to functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The severity of negative symptoms is independent of the reality distortion positive symptoms (ie, hallucinations and delusions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A person may simultaneously have deficit symptoms and be quite psychotic, or have deficit symptoms in the absence of positive symptoms.</p><p>Alternatively, negative symptoms may be secondary to other manifestations of the illness or its treatment. As examples, paranoia may lead to social isolation, and depression may lead to anergy. An unchanging facial expression may be due to extrapyramidal side effects of an antipsychotic medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2265295\"><span class=\"h3\">Deficit schizophrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not a recognized DSM-5 subtype of schizophrenia, people with schizophrenia who have prominent negative (or deficit) symptoms appear to represent a distinct subgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. People with deficit schizophrenia are less likely to have delusions with high emotional content (eg, jealous delusions), to have a depressive disorder, or to have a substance use disorder compared with nondeficit schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>]. People categorized as deficit are least likely to show improvement and recovery over the course of the illness.

It is not known whether these areas reflect multiple unique impairments, or a generalized impairment that affects multiple areas of cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Processing speed </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verbal learning and memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual learning and memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Reasoning/executive</span> functioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verbal comprehension </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social cognition </p><p/><p>These impairments are reflected in the performance on neuropsychological tests among people with schizophrenia. On average, the neuropsychological test performance of someone with schizophrenia is one to two standard deviations lower than the performance of healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. If an individual tests within the normal range on any given neuropsychological battery, then his or her pre-morbid performance was very likely to have been above average. People with schizophrenia who appear to lack cognitive impairment, when matched to healthy controls on age, education, and intelligence quotient (IQ), may actually show a unique pattern of performance impairments in memory and processing speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>Cognitive impairments usually precede the onset of positive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Impairment in the performance of cognitive tasks in people with first-episode schizophrenia is usually of a similar magnitude as that seen in people with multiple episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The same pattern of cognitive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia is seen in both treated groups and those who have never been exposed to antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284581\"><span class=\"h2\">Mood and anxiety symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mood and anxiety symptoms are common in schizophrenia; mood and anxiety disorders appear to occur at a higher rate than in the general population.

Along with treatment for symptoms and medication side effects, the patient may need help coping with disabilities, associated losses, and the stigma associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The experience of stigmatizing attitudes towards people with schizophrenia is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and may be internalized, leading to &ldquo;self-stigma&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Internalized stigma can be as damaging as the direct effects of the illness. In a five-month longitudinal study of 78 people with schizophrenia, internalized stigma was associated with poorer response to vocational rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A discriminant function analysis of 105 people with schizophrenia found that self-stigma was a predictor of decreased treatment adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284595\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated physical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several physical manifestations associated with schizophrenia, including neurological disturbances, catatonia, and metabolic disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284602\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurological disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurological &ldquo;soft signs&rdquo; involve subtle impairments of sensory integration, motor coordination, and sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Examples of neurological soft signs are right-left confusion, agraphesthesia (the inability to recognize letters or numbers traced on the skin, usually on the palm of the hand), and astereognosia (the inability to identify familiar objects by touch alone). These neurological soft signs are observed in schizophrenia, are relatively stable, and are largely unrelated to medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. </p><p>Research findings have linked certain symptom domains to neurological signs, ie, sensory integration problems have been correlated with deficit symptoms, disorganization, and cognitive impairment, while impaired sequencing of complex motor behaviors has been correlated with disorganization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>Most neurological disturbances readily observed in people with schizophrenia are likely medication-induced. Antipsychotic dopamine blockade can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as tremor and bradykinesia, acute dystonias, akathisia (a subjective sense of restlessness or actual restlessness), or tardive (meaning &lsquo;late&rsquo;) dyskinesia (which includes abnormal peri-oral and other movements). However, descriptions of movement disorders including signs of pseudoparkinsonism, choreiform movements, and myoclonic jerking are common in the descriptions of schizophrenia that predate the development of antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Although many antipsychotic medications cause metabolic disturbances, including weight gain and diabetes, people with schizophrenia often have other risk factors for these conditions, including a sedentary lifestyle and smoking. The life expectancy of people with schizophrenia is reduced by more than a decade compared with the general population.

One of the first and most influential longitudinal studies of the course of schizophrenia described eight course types, which differ in several ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset &ndash; Abrupt versus insidious </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom presentation &ndash; Continuous versus intermittent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcome &ndash; Poor versus non-poor</p><p/><p>Most people with schizophrenia in the study had an acute onset, intermittent symptoms, and later had no or only mild symptoms. Only about 20 percent had the stereotypical insidious onset, continuous symptoms, and poor outcome. In a re-examination of these data, participants were re-diagnosed with more stringent DSM-IV and ICD criteria, and the results among those retaining a schizophrenia diagnosis were largely unchanged from the original course observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Other influential longitudinal studies of schizophrenia demonstrate that the course of schizophrenia is not uniform and that there are subsets of individuals with fairly good outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. A 15- to 25-year follow-up of 644 participants with schizophrenia who participated in World Health Organization studies (including the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia and the Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders study) found that about half had favorable outcomes (minimal or no symptoms, employment, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores greater than 60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. </p><p>In general, people with the deficit form of schizophrenia seem to have a more consistently poor prognosis compared with their nondeficit peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Earlier in the illness, functional recovery is rarer. In a medication algorithm study, only about 14 percent of 118 people with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder met recovery criteria for two or more years during the first five years of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Recovery in this study was defined as no more than mild psychotic symptoms, no more than moderate negative symptoms, adequate role function (student, employment, homemaker), attention to hygiene, and independence in daily chores. </p><p>Timely, intensive treatment can impact functional recovery early in the illness. As an example, a clinical trial randomized 34 community mental health centers in 21 US states to offer people with newly-diagnosed, nonaffective psychosis either standard care (181 patients) or a program of intensive treatment (computerized, algorithm-assisted medication management; family psychoeducation; resiliency-focused individual psychotherapy; and supported <span class=\"nowrap\">education/employment;</span> 223 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The model of recovery that has emerged differs from a strictly clinical model of recovery (eg, no or mild symptoms, restored functioning). The consumer-driven model is a blend of function, life-satisfaction, and independence. Despite scientific efforts to capture this outcome, there are no currently accepted scales to measure recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schizophrenia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17284623\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of psychosis, and the medical workup to <span class=\"nowrap\">identify/exclude</span> psychoses secondary to medical conditions, are described separately.
