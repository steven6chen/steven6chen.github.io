Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated in patients with active diffuse or focal proliferative LN (class III or IV LN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Immunosuppressive therapy is usually not indicated for minimal mesangial and mesangial proliferative LN. Treatment of patients with lupus membranous nephropathy (class V LN) is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy of proliferative LN, as well as nonimmunosuppressive therapies, will be reviewed here. The treatment of resistant or relapsing proliferative LN and issues related to end-stage LN are presented separately.

Clinical risk factors for progression, evident at the time of initial presentation, include an elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, nephrotic range proteinuria, anemia with a hematocrit below 26 percent, and black and Hispanic race and ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Race and ethnicity'</a> below.)</p><p>The severity of acute and chronic tubulointerstitial disease and interstitial inflammation as well as the presence of cellular crescents also correlate with long-term prognosis in LN, as they do in many other chronic progressive glomerular diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,9</a>].

A complete renal response based upon these clinical criteria may or may not correspond to a histologic complete remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likelihood of a successful initial outcome is greater if therapy for LN is initiated relatively early in the course of the disease. Delaying therapy because of presumed mild disease can be associated with increased glomerular injury, progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and therefore a lesser response to immunosuppressive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>].</p><p>Patients with persistent, relapsing, or remitting mild hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subnephrotic proteinuria often have a &quot;smoldering&quot; but active disease that causes progressive renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At first, there may be little or no elevation in the serum creatinine since adaptive glomerular hyperfiltration in the less involved nephrons can initially maintain the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite marked nephron loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In contrast, prompt diagnosis after the onset of nephritis and subsequent initiation of appropriate therapy are associated with improved outcomes, regardless of the histologic subclass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. This issue was addressed in a study of 91 patients with LN who were followed for a median of six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was a much higher rate of ESRD among patients who had clinically recognized renal disease for greater than or equal to six months prior to biopsy (47 versus 14 per 1000 patient-years in patients who had an earlier biopsy; hazard ratio [HR] 9.3, 95% CI 1.8-47).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure to achieve a clinical response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A better long-term prognosis is associated with attaining complete response of active proliferative LN. Either a complete or partial response is associated with an improved outcome compared with no response. Partial response is associated with a much greater likelihood of a subsequent relapse than complete response, and therefore also with a poorer long-term outcome than in those who achieve a complete response. The criteria used to determine a clinical response are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Goal of immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H96363052\" class=\"local\">'Complete response versus complete remission'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of attaining a complete response was illustrated in a report from the Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study Group of 86 patients with severe LN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The 43 percent of patients who attained a complete response (ie, an inactive urine sediment, a serum creatinine &le;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [124 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L],</span> and protein excretion &le;330 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> had much higher renal survival rates at five years (94 versus 46 percent) and at 10 years (94 versus 31 percent), compared with those who did not attain a complete response. Improvement was also noted in patient survival (95 versus 60 percent at 10 years). Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The value of partial response was also demonstrated in the 10-year study of the same 86 adults with severe LN that evaluated the correlation among clinical outcomes and partial response (a 50 percent reduction in proteinuria to less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and stable serum creatinine), complete response, and no response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Compared with no response, partial response was associated with significantly higher rates of renal (45 versus 19 percent) and patient (76 versus 46 percent) survival. As in the above study, the best outcomes were observed in those who attained complete response (renal and patient survival of 94 and 96 percent, respectively).</p><p>Features generally predictive of attaining complete response are stable renal function after four weeks on therapy, lower chronicity index on renal biopsy, white race, and lower baseline proteinuria and serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, male gender and earlier development of nephritis from the time of diagnosis of lupus may be associated with a lower likelihood of sustained complete response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Relapses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapses of LN (whether nephritic flares [characterized by hematuria and a rise in serum creatinine] or proteinuric flares [characterized by increased proteinuria with a stable serum creatinine]) and lack of response to therapy are associated with an increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/13,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-20</a>]. The following examples illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 70 patients, the likelihood of doubling of the serum creatinine was increased in patients with nephritic relapses (relative risk 6.8), particularly when the relapses were associated with an acute elevation in serum creatinine (relative risk 27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Relapses tend to occur within the first five years after induction therapy. The average relapse rate is approximately 8 per 100 patient-years of follow-up but depends upon the nature of the maintenance therapy and whether a complete or partial response was obtained during induction therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 53 patients with LN who experienced a flare, 36 had a poor outcome during a median of six years (22 developed a new sustained increase in serum creatinine, and 14 had a sustained increase in creatinine above a previously elevated baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The limited utility of these features is in part due to the subjective nature of their determination and to potential sampling errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Conflicting findings have been reported in retrospective studies. Little clinical or prognostic difference between the IV-S (segmental) and IV-G (global) subgroups was reported in some studies, whereas another study noted worse 10-year renal survival in those with persistent class IV-G biopsy findings after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].</p><p>In addition, some investigators postulate that class IV-G (A [active lesions present]) will have the best prognosis with immunosuppressive regimens, while class IV-S <span class=\"nowrap\">(A/C</span> [both active and chronic lesions present]) will be less responsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Clinical risk factors for progression, evident at the time of initial presentation, include an elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, nephrotic range proteinuria, anemia, black and Hispanic race and ethnicity, and the severity of acute and chronic tubulointerstitial disease and interstitial inflammation as well as the presence of cellular crescents. Risk factors for progression that become evident after initial presentation and during therapy are the absence of a complete or partial clinical response and the frequency and severity of relapses (renal flares). Delaying therapy because of presumed mild disease is also associated with adverse outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late progression in LN, as with any form of chronic kidney disease, is often due at least in part to nonimmunologic factors such as intraglomerular hypertension. Chronic kidney disease is also associated with a marked increase in coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. As a result, patients with LN who have chronic kidney disease are often treated with antihypertensive therapy, usually with and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and with lipid lowering using a statin. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nonimmunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is indicated in patients with active proliferative LN. This includes virtually all patients with focal or diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. The goal of immunosuppressive therapy is resolution of inflammatory and immunologic activity, with achievement of a complete clinical response. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Principles of immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy for proliferative LN consists of initial (induction) and extended (maintenance) therapy. Initial therapy refers to the initial intensive therapeutic regimen given in an attempt to induce a renal response and disease quiescence. Initial therapy is followed by a more prolonged period of extended (maintenance) therapy, designed to reduce the frequency of relapses, and minimize treatment-related toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Principles of immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>initial therapy</strong> in patients with diffuse or focal proliferative LN, we recommend immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids plus either intravenous (or oral) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, rather than other immunosuppressive regimens such as glucocorticoid monotherapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The choice between cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil depends in part upon a variety of factors, including ancestry and patient preference. We usually prefer mycophenolate mofetil in black and Hispanic patients, and also in women of childbearing age. (See <a href=\"#H1470312\" class=\"local\">'Approach to initial (induction) therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1839234604\" class=\"local\">'Choosing between cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with severe active disease (eg, acute kidney injury, crescentic glomerulonephritis, severe extrarenal disease), glucocorticoid therapy is initiated with intravenous pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (250 mg to 1000 mg given over 30 minutes daily for three days) to induce a rapid immunosuppressive effect, followed by conventional doses. In patients without severe active disease, we use conventional doses of oral glucocorticoids (eg, 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) without a pulse. There is no consensus about the best oral glucocorticoid regimen. One option is oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> at a dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> tapered every two weeks by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> until 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached, then tapered by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> until 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is reached.

However, some authorities prefer a longer (higher-dose) regimen consisting of pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> monthly for six to seven months. Oral cyclophosphamide is also occasionally used in select circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil is used instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> as initial therapy, we give 0.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil twice daily for the first week, then 1 g twice daily for the second week, and thereafter increase the dose to 1.5 g twice daily. If 1.5 g twice daily is not tolerated, we change the dosing schedule to 1 g thrice daily; if still not tolerated, we reduce the dose to 1 g twice daily. We usually continue mycophenolate mofetil at these doses for six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During initial (induction) immunosuppressive therapy, we typically schedule follow-up visits every two to four weeks for the first three months. In stable patients, the duration between follow-up visits can then be extended to every two to three months. The goal of these visits is to evaluate the patient's response to therapy (ie, whether or not a clinical response is achieved) and the toxicity of the regimen (ie, adverse effects, infections due to immunosuppression). (See <a href=\"#H1839235143\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring patients during initial (induction) therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant number of patients fail to achieve an adequate response to initial treatment.

In patients who receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> as initial therapy, extended (maintenance) therapy is started two to four weeks after the last dose of cyclophosphamide when the following criteria are met: the white blood cell (WBC) count is &gt;3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> and the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. The risk of infection is increased when the ANC is less than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903 \">table 2</a>). In patients who receive oral cyclophosphamide as initial therapy, we initiate extended therapy immediately after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide, provided the WBC count is &gt;3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and the ANC is &gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. In patients who receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil as initial therapy, the dose of mycophenolate mofetil is gradually lowered over time, usually starting after six months of therapy at the initial dose. The long-term dose of mycophenolate is usually lower than the initial dose. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Extended (maintenance) therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Approach to extended (maintenance) therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most commonly used drugs for extended (maintenance) therapy in patients with LN are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. For patients who achieve a complete or partial response with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or mycophenolate mofetil, we recommend extended therapy with mycophenolate mofetil rather than other agents, such azathioprine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The usual mycophenolate mofetil dose is 1000 mg twice daily. However, azathioprine is preferred in women who have achieved a complete response and want to become pregnant. In addition, we also use azathioprine for maintenance therapy in patients who are intolerant to mycophenolate mofetil. Patients who are intolerant to both mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine can be treated with cyclosporine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.
