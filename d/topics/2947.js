After your surgery, you can only drink liquids for the first week or so. You can then slowly start to eat solid foods. Work with a nutritionist (a food expert) to learn how your diet should change. If you eat the wrong things, you could hurt your chances of losing weight or you might make yourself sick.</p><p>If you have gastric banding, for example, and don't chew your food enough, take large bites, or eat too fast, you could end up vomiting. If you have gastric bypass, and eat sugary foods after surgery, you could have another problem, called &quot;dumping syndrome.&quot; Dumping syndrome makes you feel sick to your stomach, light-headed, and makes you shake, sweat, and turn red and feel hot, especially on your face. It can also cause diarrhea.</p><p>To avoid these problems and improve your chances of losing weight, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat slowly and chew your food well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop eating when you feel full. You will feel full much sooner than before the surgery because your stomach is so much smaller. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat healthy foods that are high in protein and low in fat and calories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking and eating at the same time. Wait 30 minutes after you finish eating to drink water or other beverages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sugary foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid liquid foods that are high in calories, such as ice cream.</p><p/><p>You might find that you dislike foods that you used to like, such as meat. You might also find that you like foods that you used to dislike, such as fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328288\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need to take vitamin and mineral supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will need to take special multivitamins with minerals. That's because weight loss surgery can make it hard for your body to get all the nutrients it needs. You must keep taking the vitamins for the rest of your life. Your body will always need them to stay healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328305\"><span class=\"h1\">How often will I need to see my doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see your doctor every 4 to 6 weeks for the first 6 months after your surgery, then every 3 months. After 1 year, you can switch to yearly visits. He or she will check your weight and blood pressure and make sure you do not have any problems caused by the surgery.</p><p>You will also need blood tests to check that your body is getting all the nutrients you need to stay healthy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328322\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my health problems get better after weight loss surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people who have weight loss surgery find that certain health problems get better or go away after they lose weight. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short amounts of time while you sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux disease, a condition that causes heartburn</p><p/><p>Because these conditions often improve, you might be able to cut back or stop taking medicines for these problems. But be sure to check with your doctor before changing how you take any of your medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328339\"><span class=\"h1\">What health problems can happen after weight loss surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Problems that can happen soon after the surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blockage or tear in the intestines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the heart or lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for more surgery</p><p/><p>Other problems that can happen later after surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstones &ndash; These are small, sometimes painful stones that form inside the gallbladder, a small organ under the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blockage in the intestines (called an &quot;obstruction&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from a sore than can form where the stomach and intestine are reconnected during gastric bypass surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had gastric banding, the band can slip or wear down the tissue underneath the band, but this is rare.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328356\"><span class=\"h1\">How will I feel after I have weight loss surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After losing large amounts of weight, you might feel more confident, successful, and able to talk about your feelings. But you might also feel sad or depressed. This can happen if you used to eat large amounts of food for comfort and can no longer do so.</p><p>Because your eating habits are different, you might feel awkward at business or social events that focus on food. You might find that your relationships with family, friends, and coworkers change if they treat you differently as a thinner person.</p><p>You can ask your doctor to recommend a counselor (such as a social worker or therapist) or a support group to help you cope with the changes after weight loss surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328373\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are very overweight are more likely to get pregnant after they lose weight. But you should not try to get pregnant for at least a year after weight loss surgery. To avoid pregnancy, you should use a method besides birth control pills. Birth control pills might not work as well as usual in women who have had weight loss surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86328390\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss surgery (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-and-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss surgery and procedures (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
