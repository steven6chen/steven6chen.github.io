Removal of excess extracellular fluid with diuretics to treat peripheral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary edema is one of the mainstays of volume management. In contrast to other HF therapies such as angiotensin inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, limited outcomes data are available for diuretic therapy.</p><p>Issues related to the use of diuretics, as well as sodium and fluid restriction, in patients with HF will be reviewed here. The evaluation, including assessment of volume status, and overall management of HF are discussed separately.

However, few clinical trials have studied the impact of diuretic therapy on clinical outcomes. </p><p>A meta-analysis of diuretic treatment in chronic HF demonstrated a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes, although only small trials were available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Three trials with a total of 202 patients with chronic HF found a reduction in mortality with diuretic use compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83). Admission for worsening HF was reduced by diuretics compared with placebo in two trials with a total of 169 patients (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.52). These results are consistent with data from observational studies as well as diuretic trials demonstrating rapid improvement in dyspnea in patients treated largely with diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>However, observational data have raised safety concerns about diuretic treatment of HF. Several uncontrolled studies have found that higher diuretic doses are associated with worse outcomes, including mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Use of nonpotassium sparing diuretics to treat HF has been associated with arrhythmic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, these observations are confounded by the indications for high dose diuretic use (ie, the need for higher doses of loop diuretics is likely a marker of more severe HF with increased mortality risk).</p><p>The blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine often rise during diuretic treatment of HF and careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is recommended. These issues are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H16979970\" class=\"local\">'Effects on renal function'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major issues that should be considered about diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) include salt and water restriction, the choice and dose of diuretic, hemodynamic consequences of the diuresis, improved survival with aldosterone antagonism, and variable effects on systemic vascular resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929918825\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium and fluid restriction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929918832\"><span class=\"h3\">Sodium restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium restriction has been commonly recommended in patients with acute or chronic HF, although there are insufficient data to support any specific level of sodium intake in patients with symptomatic HF, as noted in the 2013 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> and 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Randomized trials have produced inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and two systematic reviews of clinical trials have been retracted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A retrospective analysis of patients with chronic ambulatory HF who were enrolled in the HF Adherence and Retention Trial compared outcomes in those with daily sodium intakes of &lt;2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (restricted sodium intake) versus &ge;2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (unrestricted sodium intake) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The restricted sodium group had a higher risk of death or HF hospitalization, raising the possibility that sodium restriction exerts a detrimental effect. Although the observational nature of this study precludes cause-and-effect conclusions, it highlights the need for further study of the optimal approach to sodium restriction. </p><p>Given the available limited evidence, the optimum sodium intake for patients with HF is not known. Based on expert opinion, we advise our patients with HF to restrict sodium intake to 2 to 3 g per day. The 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines suggest some degree (eg, &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/d)</span> of sodium restriction in patients with symptomatic HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929918847\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest fluid restriction (eg, 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/d)</span> in patients with refractory HF, particularly in patients with hyponatremia, as suggested by the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Stricter fluid restriction is indicated in patients with severe (serum sodium &lt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> or worsening hyponatremia, although patient tolerance of strict fluid restriction may be limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H2054580026\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid restriction'</a>.)</p><p>Hyponatremia is common among HF patients and the degree of reduction in serum sodium parallels the severity of the HF. As a result, a low serum sodium is an adverse prognostic indicator. Most HF patients with hyponatremia have volume overload, rather than volume depletion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretic use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with HF and volume overload are initially treated with the combination of an oral loop diuretic (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>) and a low sodium diet. The three major manifestations of volume overload in HF are pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Volume assessment'</a>). Intravenous administration of loop diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) is generally required for acute decompensation or severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Refractory edema'</a> below.)</p><p>Loop diuretics are often required for fluid control and to relieve symptoms, but the risk of arrhythmic death may be increased if hypokalemia occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the data supporting this observation may be confounded by the fact that the need for loop diuretics may be correlated with more severe HF and increased mortality risk.</p><p>Aldosterone antagonism with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> can be added to loop diuretics to modestly enhance the diuresis and minimize potassium loss. More importantly, these drugs improve survival in patients with systolic HF. The benefits of aldosterone antagonists in patients with HF are thought to be relatively independent of their diuretic effect and may be due to a beneficial influence on cardiovascular remodeling and other actions. Eplerenone is a more specific aldosterone antagonist that is associated with fewer side effects but is much more expensive than generic spironolactone.

However, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> may be preferred to oral furosemide in certain circumstances. The bioavailability of oral furosemide is only about 50 percent overall with substantial <strong>interpatient and intrapatient variability</strong> (range 10 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As a result, there may be a greater response to oral torsemide or bumetanide, which are more predictably absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, torsemide has a longer half-life than both furosemide and bumetanide.</p><p>A potential benefit of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> was suggested by the following two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An open label, randomized trial enrolled 234 patients with chronic HF who were treated with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> at average daily doses of 136 and 72 mg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The primary end point of readmission for HF at one year was significantly lower with torsemide (17 versus 32 percent). If using torsemide reduces the risk of hospitalization, it may be a cost-effective treatment despite its higher per dose cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational post-marketing surveillance study of 1377 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) found a significantly lower one-year mortality among those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> compared with those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or other diuretics (2.2 versus 4.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Data are more limited on the relative efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>We generally start diuretic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> but switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> if the response to furosemide is inadequate.

There is virtually no increase in natriuresis until the threshold concentration of luminal diuretic is reached and, once the threshold is exceeded, the degree of natriuresis increases until a maximal ceiling is reached. Patients with HF have a lesser response to a given dose of diuretic than normal subjects for two reasons: decreased diuretic delivery to the kidney (and therefore less transport of diuretic into the tubular lumen) because renal blood flow is reduced; and increased sodium reabsorption at other sites due to hypoperfusion-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. Intestinal absorption of an oral loop diuretic may be delayed in patients with edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Slower absorption will generate a lower peak concentration despite total absorbed dose similar to that in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and this will reduce the diuretic effect if the threshold concentration is not achieved.

Subsequent dosing is determined by the diuretic response. Thus, if a patient does not respond to 20 mg of furosemide, the dose should be increased to 40 mg rather than giving the same dose twice a day. Maximum single doses are discussed below.

Although hemoconcentration was strongly associated with worsening renal function (odds ratio 5.3), it was also associated with a large and significant reduction in 180-day mortality (adjusted hazard 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.44). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of the diuresis and associated complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential fall in cardiac output induced by loop diuretic therapy (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Filling pressures and cardiac output'</a> below) has important implications for the time course of the diuresis. In both normal individuals and those with HF, the ensuing activation of sodium-retaining mechanisms (angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine) as well as flow-dependent hypertrophy in the distal tubule limits the response to continued diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>In <strong>stable</strong> patients with HF, negative balances for sodium and potassium are greatest during the first few days of loop diuretic therapy (with most sodium losses typically occurring after the first dose). The time required to achieve a new steady state (when sodium and potassium excretion equals intake) depends on the amount of fluid overload at the start of therapy, but it averages two weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 1</a>). Once a new steady state is reached, continued diuretic therapy will maintain the fluid loss that has been attained but will not induce further fluid or potassium loss unless the dose is increased, a second type of diuretic is added, or there is a change in HF severity or sodium intake. Thus, monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is warranted if the diuretic regimen is augmented or changes in HF severity or sodium intake are suspected.

In this setting, there may be an acute increase in plasma renin and norepinephrine levels, leading to arteriolar vasoconstriction and a rise in systemic blood pressure; this increase in afterload then induces a reduction in cardiac output and a transient rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure that can last for an hour, with possible worsening of dyspnea. Fortunately, by four hours, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures fall below pre-diuretic values due both to the diuresis and a decrease in vasoconstrictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

One possibility is that patients with chronic HF (or cirrhosis) have persistent elevations in renin and angiotensin II release (induced by decreased renal perfusion) that are associated with hyperplasia of the renin secretory apparatus. As a result, administration of a loop diuretic may lead to an exaggerated rise in renin release and systemic vasoconstriction. By comparison, the vasodilator prostaglandin response may predominate in patients with an acute myocardial infarction who do not have chronic hypersecretion of renin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">REFRACTORY EDEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced heart failure (HF) become less responsive to conventional oral doses of a loop diuretic due to reductions in renal perfusion and increases in sodium-retaining hormones, such as angiotensin II and aldosterone. </p><p>Another factor that may contribute to a diminished diuretic response in patients with HF is the presence of hypoalbuminemia. All the commonly used diuretics are highly protein-bound (more than 90 percent). This limits the diuretic to the vascular space, thereby maximizing its rate of delivery to the kidney. The degree of protein-binding is reduced with hypoalbuminemia, resulting in a larger extravascular space of distribution, a slower rate of delivery to the kidney, and possibly reduced diuresis. The protein bound diuretic is removed from the protein and secreted into the renal tubule by organic anion transporters. &#160;</p><p>The approach to treatment of patients with refractory edema is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;</a>.) Summarized briefly, treatment options in refractory edema include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> is associated with substantial interpatient and intrapatient variability in bioavailability.

(See <a href=\"#H9160774\" class=\"local\">'Choice of loop diuretic'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail oral therapy may respond to more reliable diuretic delivery via intravenous administration by either intermittent bolus therapy or continuous intravenous infusion. Both methods of delivery appear to have similar efficacy and safety in patients with HF. The efficacy of a continuous intravenous infusion edema has not been evaluated in patients with refractory edema. However, it has not been proven that intravenous diuretic is more effective than high doses of oral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9160965\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of ADHF'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If loop diuretic therapy does not produce a sufficient diuresis, addition of a <strong>thiazide-type</strong> diuretic may be beneficial by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Thiazide efficacy is enhanced in patients chronically treated with a loop diuretic, since the loop diuretic-induced increase in sodium delivery out of the loop of Henle leads to an increase in distal tubule sodium reabsorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53198\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53198 \">figure 4</a>). On the other hand, the thiazide-induced increase in sodium delivery out of the distal tubule can increase urinary potassium excretion and reduce the serum potassium concentration. Thus, as with the initiation of loop diuretic therapy or increasing the loop diuretic dose, careful monitoring for the development of hypokalemia is warranted when a thiazide diuretic is added. In patients with stable HF, the increase in urinary potassium excretion is greatest in the first week of therapy at a given dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 1</a>).

In addition, the associated reduction in collecting tubule sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion can both enhance the diuresis and minimize the degree of potassium wasting. Thus, if not already being given, it is reasonable to initiate aldosterone antagonist therapy <strong>prior</strong> to the addition of a thiazide diuretic in patients with a low or low-normal serum potassium on loop diuretic therapy alone. <br/><br/>Aldosterone antagonist therapy should be continued only in patients who can be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia.
