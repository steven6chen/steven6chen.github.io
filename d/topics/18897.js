Deficiency of ZAP-70 causes a combined immunodeficiency (CID). Affected children present within the first two years of life with a history of recurrent infections, similar to infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, diagnosis can be delayed because most patients with ZAP-70 deficiency have detectable lymphoid tissues and a normal lymphocyte count. The treatment of choice is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p>A review of ZAP-70 deficiency (MIM +176947) is discussed here. Reviews related to other CIDs are presented separately. SCID disorders are also discussed separately.

This association leads to activation of multiple pathways eventually culminating in a T cell response. The Src-family protein tyrosine kinase Lck is first activated with resultant phosphorylation of motifs known as immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Phosphorylated ITAMs on CD3 zeta serve as binding sites for ZAP-70. ZAP-70 is also activated by autophosphorylation. The role of this kinase in TCR signaling was unveiled by studying humans with ZAP-70 deficiency. Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates a variety of downstream molecules, resulting in calcium mobilization, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and activation of Ras guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase). These events lead to activation of several transcription factors with resultant T cell proliferation and differentiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-signaling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor signaling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24434174\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ZAP-70 deficiency is a rare combined immunodeficiency (CID) with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The disease was first described in 1989 in a patient of Mennonite descent with CD8 lymphocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mutations in ZAP-70 were initially identified in Mennonite kindreds and subsequently in Hispanics, Japanese, Turkish, and Portuguese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24434181\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ZAP-70 plays a crucial role in T cell development and function, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The thymus is not dysplastic in patients with ZAP-70 deficiency, unlike typical cases of combined immunodeficiency (CID) or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Thymus architecture and cellularity are preserved, as are the number and size of Hassall's corpuscles. Normal expression of <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3/CD4/CD8</span> double-positive thymocytes in the cortex and single positive <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3/CD4,</span> but not CD8 T cells, are present in the medullary area as seen on immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The phenotype of affected patients suggests that ZAP-70 is critical for CD8 T cell selection and peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell function but is dispensable for CD4 selection in the thymus. One possible explanation for the presence of normal numbers of peripheral CD4+ T cells is that Syk, which is expressed at higher levels in the thymus than in the blood in humans, may rescue CD4 selection in the absence of ZAP-70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The differential ability of Syk to replace ZAP-70 in CD4 versus CD8 selection events may be related to the preferential association of Lck with the CD4 coreceptor. This preferential association would facilitate CD4 selection if Syk was unable to fully substitute for loss of ZAP-70 function during thymocyte differentiation. Normal downregulation of Syk activity in mature T cells would abrogate T cell receptor (TCR) signaling altogether and lead to combined CD4 and CD8 immunodeficiency in patients with ZAP-70 deficiency, but studies so far have been controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p>Other studies suggest that ZAP-70 may affect thymopoiesis at an earlier stage than previously considered. Assessment of gene rearrangement events that represent sequential stages of thymocyte maturation suggest a reduction, but not a complete block, of T cell development during transition from double-negative to double-positive cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This may explain the low levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) found in peripheral CD4+ cells, consistent with a relatively low number of na&iuml;ve cells. However, this model cannot explain the preferential selection of single-positive CD4+ T cells. The expansion and survival of CD4+ T cells in the circulation may be explained by their reduced ability to undergo apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>ZAP-70 is also critical for T cell function. Peripheral T cells from ZAP-70-deficient patients demonstrate defective TCR-mediated signaling, but they are capable of secreting interleukin (IL) 2 and proliferating if stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin that bypass the need for early TCR-mediated events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. These T cells are polyclonal, with full representation of the TCR repertoire, although CD4 cells do not differentiate into T helper 2 (Th2) cells and lack inhibitory controls, such as IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This phenotype has the hallmarks of an autoimmune signature. Indeed, several patients have presented with overt autoimmune disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24434188\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ZAP-70 deficiency is due to autosomal recessive mutations in the <em>ZAP70</em> gene, located on chromosome 2q12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Several separate mutations in the <em>ZAP70</em> gene have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/2,4-6,13-15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6,13-15,17,18</a>]. Most mutations occur within the kinase domain of the ZAP-70 protein and significantly affect both protein stability and catalytic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68529\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68529 \">figure 3</a>). There is one report of a mutation leading to expression of ZAP-70 that is rapidly degraded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and another report of a defect that results in an expressed but nonfunctional protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One hypomorphic mutation in a noncoding intron resulting in decreased protein expression and a milder phenotype has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, a family with two siblings who were compound heterozygous for both a hypomorphic mutation in the first SH2 domain and an activating mutation in the kinase domain had a unique constellation of autoimmune phenotypes including bullous pemphigoid associated with autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24434195\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children with ZAP-70 deficiency present within the first two years of life with a history of recurrent infections, similar to infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, unlike those patients, ZAP-70 deficiency patients may present later in childhood and invariably have palpable lymph nodes, visible tonsils, and a thymus shadow on imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67690 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

These infections may appear later than six months of age, and, at least initially, they respond well to antibiotic or antiviral treatment. Similarly, chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive are less frequent and appear in less than half of the patients reported.</p><p>Autoimmunity or manifestations of immune dysregulation such as ulcerative colitis and blood cytopenias are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Unique presentations such as pustular skin lesions from birth, subcutaneous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and multisystem autoantibody disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] are also seen. In one family with a unique mutation profile, two children had bullous pemphigoid, nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune hemophilia, and inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, cases with aberrant inflammatory features like Omenn syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Expression of T cell surface proteins other than CD8 is normal.

ZAP-70 deficiency should be considered in infants and young children with recurrent bacterial or opportunistic infections, in spite of having palpable lymph nodes, notable thymus shadow, and normal lymphocyte count. It should also be suspected in patients with early-onset autoimmunity and lymphoma. The initial evaluation should include enumeration of peripheral blood T cell subsets and B cells, serum immunoglobulin, and T cell responses to mitogens in vitro.</p><p>The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of relatively normal numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (&gt;3.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> and normal or only modestly decreased total T cells (&gt;1.2 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> but absent CD8 T cells (&lt;5 percent) in the circulation. Analysis of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) may also be valuable since these levels appear to gradually decline during the first year of life in patients with ZAP-70 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Absent T cell proliferation to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimuli, such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA), CD3 monoclonal antibody, or to alloantigen in mixed lymphocyte culture, confirms the diagnosis of a cellular immune deficiency.</p><p>The patient most likely has ZAP-70 deficiency if further evaluation demonstrates that in vitro T cell proliferation to PMA plus ionomycin (which bypass the need for early signaling) is comparable with that of normal T cells. Protein expression by immunoblot may help in diagnosis if ZAP-70 is absent or reduced. cDNA or genomic DNA sequencing to identify mutations in the ZAP-70 gene confirms the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24434237\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborn screening based upon quantification of the number of TRECs cannot be relied upon to detect ZAP-70 deficiency, because TREC levels are normal in newborns with this immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zap-70-deficiency/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>].

It is required for normal human T cell development and function.

(See <a href=\"#H24434181\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ZAP-70 deficiency is due to mutations in the <em>ZAP70</em> gene, located on chromosome 2q12. Most mutations occur within the kinase domain of the ZAP-70 protein and significantly affect both protein stability and catalytic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68529\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68529 \">figure 3</a>), although a novel activating mutation leads to severe autoantibody-mediated disease.

Alternative presentations include pustular skin manifestations, autoimmune features with bullous pemphigoid in one family, Omenn syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H24434195\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ZAP-70 deficiency have normal to elevated numbers of circulating lymphocytes. The total T cell number is normal or only modestly decreased, but CD8 T cells are absent (&lt;5 percent) in the circulation. T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) levels in ZAP-70-deficient cells may be normal or low, indicating that they may be missed by TREC newborn screening. The presence of lymphopenia suggests an alternative diagnosis.
