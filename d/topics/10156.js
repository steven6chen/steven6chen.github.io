The kidneys are organs in the urinary tract that filter the blood and make urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). Kidney disease can cause swelling, high blood pressure, and other symptoms.</p><p>&quot;Lupus nephritis&quot; is the medical name for a type of kidney disease that happens in people with lupus. People who have lupus can also get kidney disease caused by other problems. As an example, if someone with lupus also has diabetes, the diabetes might be the cause of kidney problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373416\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of lupus nephritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some people with lupus nephritis don't have symptoms, about half of all people with lupus do. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling &ndash; This can be in the hands, face, feet, belly, or around the eyes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight changes &ndash; Many people gain weight, but some people lose weight without trying to.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that looks brown or foamy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating less often than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure (higher than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90)</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373431\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for lupus nephritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have lupus, your doctor or nurse will do regular blood and urine tests to check for signs of lupus nephritis. You might also have a test called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of kidney tissue. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to check for kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373446\"><span class=\"h1\">How is lupus nephritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines are usually the first treatment for lupus nephritis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system &ndash; In lupus, the body's immune system attacks healthy cells. Medicines that partly turn it off can slow down the damage lupus causes in the kidneys. There are many different medicines doctors use to treat the immune system. The doctor might:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Try 1 or 2 medicines to see which works best</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Give you more than 1 medicine at a time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have you switch to a different medicine when the lupus nephritis is under control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot; or &quot;angiotensin receptor blockers&quot; &ndash; These medicines can help with kidney damage from lupus nephritis.</p><p/><p>Severe lupus nephritis can make the kidneys stop working. If this happens, treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis, often called &quot;dialysis&quot; &ndash; A machine filters your blood every few days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal dialysis &ndash; A fluid is piped in and out of your belly every day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71539 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney transplant &ndash; Doctors replace your kidneys with a healthy kidney from a donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59957\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59957 \">figure 4</a>). (People only need 1 working kidney to live.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373530\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting pregnant when you have lupus nephritis can be risky. It can increase the chance that the unborn baby will die before birth. Being pregnant can also make lupus nephritis worse.</p><p>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse before you start trying to get pregnant. There are ways to reduce the chances of having problems. For example, it is important to wait until you have not had lupus nephritis symptoms for at least 6 months. Your doctor can work with you to try to make this happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373545\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with lupus must take medicine to control the symptoms and slow down the disease. This is true for people with lupus nephritis, too. Lupus nephritis sometimes goes away on its own. Other times, symptoms come back after treatment. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to treat them if this happens to you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715373560\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
