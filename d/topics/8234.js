Some of the improvement is attributable to a reduction in the incidence of stent thrombosis, a complication often associated with MI and death.

In practice, we do not routinely use any of the bleeding risk scores. Rather, we individualize recommendations by taking into account how many factors are present and patient preferences. The following are two examples. A 55-year-old, hypertensive individual is at somewhat increased risk but we would not necessarily modify our usual recommendations based on the presence of hypertension. On the other hand, an 80-year-old individual on oral anticoagulant is at extremely high bleeding risk and we would attempt to shorten the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).</p><p>The HAS-BLED score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75259 \">table 1</a>), which was developed to assess bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients, is a commonly-referred-to bleeding risk score.

This risk is highest during the first 30 days but is quite low if the patient is taking DAPT. After 30 days, the daily risk continues to fall with time. However, the risk of bleeding due to DAPT and its consequences are relatively constant over time. Thus, the benefit from DAPT is greatest during the first 30 days and is smaller after six months. &#160;</p><p>The impact of bleeding and ischemic events after PCI was examined in a study of 8582 patients who underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-bleeding-risk-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There were 1060 (12.4 percent of the entire cohort) episodes of definite or possible stent thrombosis (0.9 percent), clinical bleeding (8.1 percent), or myocardial infarction not related to stent thrombosis (3.4 percent). The risk of death within 30 days of each for these events was 38.5, 7.3, and 7.5 percent, respectively. This is consistent with much higher mortality risk but low frequency for stent thrombosis, whereas overall ischemic (stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction not related to stent thrombosis) and bleeding occur with similar frequency and carry similar mortality risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3229790724\"><span class=\"h1\">BMS VERSUS DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts have suggested the earlier endothelialization seen with bare metal stents (BMS) compared with drug-eluting stents (DES) might lead to a relatively decreased risk of stent thrombosis in patients treated with BMS who prematurely discontinue DAPT. There is no high-quality evidence that demonstrates that the use of BMS is superior to second generation DES in this setting. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that DES are a reasonable choice for patients who are at high bleeding risk and who may likely receive four to six weeks of DAPT. </p><p>The ZEUS AND LEADERS FREE trials treated patients at high bleeding risk who were treated with either BMS or DES and received DAPT for about 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-bleeding-risk-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In both studies, the rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in the DES group. However, limitations of both studies make us unable to conclude that DES are superior to BMS with regard to safety in this setting.

Those with a PCI indication of stable ischemic heart disease received one month of DAPT, and those with ACS received six months of DAPT. DES and a short duration of DAPT, compared with BMS and a similar duration of DAPT, reduced the occurrence of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization, suggesting that DES are the preferred stent type with short duration DAPT in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-bleeding-risk-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3138135091\"><span class=\"h1\">POBA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it is theoretically possible that performance of plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) might be a reasonable revascularization strategy to stenting for patients who cannot take DAPT for more than brief periods of time, this approach has not been evaluated.

Although we evaluate each patient for the presence of these risk factors, we do not use a formal bleeding risk score to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H355774210\" class=\"local\">'Definition of high bleeding risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3813886857\" class=\"local\">'Assessing bleeding risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable patients at high bleeding risk and who will receive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for as short as 30 days, most experts choose current generation or bioresorbable polymer drug-eluting stents (DES). (See <a href=\"#H2446180642\" class=\"local\">'Choice of stent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable patients treated with BMS at high bleeding risk, we recommend a minimum of four weeks of uninterrupted DAPT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For such patients treated with DES, we suggest uninterrupted DAPT for a minimum of one to three months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The decision to extend DAPT beyond the minimal duration needs to be individualized based on ischemic and bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"#H2410420207\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we believe it is reasonable to extend these durations to three months for BMS and six months for DES.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> in stable patients treated with an oral anticoagulant and DAPT. For ACS patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy, which places the patient at very high bleeding risk, we prefer clopidogrel or ticagrelor to prasugrel.
