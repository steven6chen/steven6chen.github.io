Symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment for ALS, and is reviewed in this topic. Other aspects of ALS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Most ALS patients die within three to five years of diagnosis. However, longer survival is not rare. About 30 percent of ALS patients are alive five years after diagnosis, and 10 to 20 percent survive for greater than 10 years. Long-term survival is associated with a younger age at symptom onset, male gender, and limb rather than bulbar symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BREAKING THE NEWS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Informing the patient and family of the diagnosis of ALS is a daunting task for the clinician. The diagnosis should always be given face-to-face, with enough time to ensure no rushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It may be helpful to have the patient's support network present; European guidelines note a perceived advantage if the patient&rsquo;s network outnumbers the medical staff present at the meeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is important to give a warning that bad news is coming and to acknowledge and explore the patient's reaction. Allow for questions, give reassurance that the complications of ALS are treatable, and give reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned. Offer a second opinion if the patient wishes. It is often useful to schedule a return visit within a short time frame so that questions can be addressed and family members can attend if desired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients have a delay in diagnosis that is very distressing. For these patients, a diagnosis may be good news, in that uncertainty is reduced, and active therapy can be initiated. The discussion of diagnosis should always be accompanied by a discussion of the ways that symptoms can be treated, as well as by institution of disease modifying treatment, assuming cost is not prohibitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Riluzole'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multidisciplinary ALS clinics provide care from neurologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, respiratory therapists, dietitians, social workers, and nursing care managers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Thus, specialized clinics can guide the management of the complex issues related to ALS, which include respiratory symptoms, nutrition, dysarthria, dysphagia, functional decline, and psychosocial problems.</p><p>Although data are limited, some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] studies suggest that patients with ALS who are followed by multidisciplinary or tertiary ALS centers have improved survival compared with those who are followed by general neurology clinics. In addition, multidisciplinary care may improve quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Current American guidelines state that specialized multidisciplinary clinic referral should be considered for patients with ALS, with the goals of optimizing health care delivery, prolonging survival, and enhancing quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, European guidelines note that multidisciplinary care should be available for all people affected by ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Palliative care should be provided at the time of diagnosis to provide an added layer of support to the ALS team and to the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family,</span> particularly around symptom management and family support. Palliative care aims to enhance quality of life in all stages of a serious illness and does not have to be limited to end-of-life care. In addition to symptom management, other objectives of comprehensive palliative support include establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient's values and preferences, consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all caregivers, psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family, and coordination across sites of care.</p><p>At the end-of-life (expected prognosis of six months or less) or when goals shift exclusively to comfort, hospice should become involved. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Hospice care'</a> below.)</p><p>Information for healthcare practitioners and patients regarding ALS management is available from the ALS Association (<a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/&amp;token=Q2BBjCaVfyfh1nJneLOZ5gCrHbhm9rOD0mApcdJqlgc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5129\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.alsa.org</a>) and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (<a href=\"http://www.mda.org/&amp;token=5lHNfeIUV75Bl7EJ2f5xTV8RE/Yms/Hf5ogzUNCzp5U=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5129\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.mda.org</a>). Both organizations certify clinics that have met a variety of quality and access criteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our suggested management of respiratory symptoms in patients with ALS is based upon the available published data, consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/4,5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,13</a>], and clinical experience. Important aspects of pulmonary care include counseling the patient and family about potential treatments, the use of pulmonary tests to assess respiratory function, and the utility of noninvasive and invasive ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The general aspects of respiratory management in patients with neuromuscular disease are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of initial diagnosis, discussion should focus on limited aspects of diagnosis and potential treatments. A discussion of respiratory options may be deferred at this visit if the patient has no respiratory symptoms and has a vital capacity &gt;60 percent of predicted for age and height. However, respiratory management should be a topic of careful discussion very early in the course of a clinician's relationship with the patient.</p><p>Once beyond initial diagnosis, but before respiratory symptoms occur, it is crucial to inform patients both of the respiratory choices available to them and the need for their participation in the decision-making process. Decisions about late issues, such as the desire for tracheostomy and chronic ventilatory support, must be considered as part of a patient's overall care plan. While active respiratory management should be initiated at an earlier stage, early discussion about these issues is not sufficient, as patient's views are likely to change over time.</p><p>At all stages of the disease, patients have the right to refuse or withdraw any treatment, including mechanical ventilation. When withdrawing ventilation, opiates and anxiolytics should be used in adequate doses to relieve dyspnea and anxiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withholding-and-withdrawing-ventilatory-support-in-adults-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to offer the patient information about the terminal stage of ALS, once dyspnea or nocturnal hypoventilation begins or when the VC drops below 50 percent. Patients may fear &quot;choking to death,&quot; and describing the terminal hypercapnic coma and resulting peaceful death can provide relief from this fear in most patients and families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ALS should have serial assessment of respiratory function every three months starting at the time of diagnosis. Understanding of the pace of an individual's disease is very helpful for planning appropriate interventions at the right time.</p><p>A decrease of vital capacity (VC) to 50 percent of predicted is often associated with respiratory symptoms, and a VC of &lt;25 to 30 percent of predicted is associated with significant risk of respiratory failure or sudden death. Hypoxia and hypercarbia are late findings and thus should <strong>not</strong> be relied upon as early predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation or other forms of respiratory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although widely used, the VC is not an ideal test of respiratory muscle strength in patients with ALS, in part because the shape of the lung pressure-volume curve makes the VC insensitive to modest changes in muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, patients with ALS and bulbar weakness may not have enough strength to make a complete seal around the mouthpiece, particularly in later stages of disease progression. This potentially limits the clinical utility of the VC at a time when prognostic information is most urgently needed regarding initiation of noninvasive ventilation. The same limitation applies to one alternative test, the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP, also called the maximal mouth inspiratory force).</p><p>Another alternative, the maximal sniff nasal inspiratory force (SNIF, also called the sniff nasal pressure), avoids the need for a mouthpiece and thus may be better suited than the VC and MIP for testing patients with bulbar weakness. In addition, the SNIF has been shown to correlate well with diaphragm strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and it is sensitive to changes in respiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In a prospective observational study of 98 patients with ALS, a higher proportion of patients could still perform the SNIF at the last clinic visit (before death or study completion) compared with the VC or MIP (94 versus 84 versus 79 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, a SNIF of &lt;40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O had a higher sensitivity for predicting six-month mortality compared with a VC of &lt;50 percent maximum (97 versus 58 percent), but a slightly lower specificity (79 versus 96 percent).</p><p>These results support the impression that the SNIF test is clinically useful for monitoring respiratory muscle strength in patients with ALS. However, the prognostic value of the SNIF requires confirmation in larger clinical studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is a therapeutic option for many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/5,14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,22</a>]. It is especially useful if patients have symptoms of respiratory compromise at night, but patients often use it during waking hours as the disease progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>NPPV improves the quality of life in patients who can tolerate its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. It is likely, though not conclusively demonstrated, that its use prolongs life as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], particularly in those compliant with &ge;4 hours of NPPV each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and those without severe bulbar dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. A retrospective cohort study found that NPPV was associated with improved survival even in patients with bulbar-onset ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although this result is inconsistent with some other reports just cited.</p><p>Given these data, we suggest the use of NPPV for patients with ALS and respiratory compromise. Similarly, current guidelines state that NPPV should be considered to treat respiratory insufficiency in ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Criteria for initiating noninvasive ventilation include vital capacity &lt;50 percent of predicted, or the presence of orthopnea, or sniff nasal inspiratory force &lt;40 cm, or maximal inspiratory pressure &lt;-60 cm, or abnormal nocturnal oximetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There are no data-driven standards for deciding when to initiate noninvasive mechanical ventilation, but the criteria discussed above are most commonly employed at ALS centers and are recommended by current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As adjustment to NPPV requires time and patience on the part of respiratory therapists and patients, it should be initiated as early as possible in patients with respiratory compromise.</p><p>Patient tolerance of the face mask used is crucial to the success of NPPV. There are many face masks to choose from [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and patients must be encouraged not to forgo treatment if they are not comfortable with the initial interface. Occasionally, small doses of anxiolytic medications will help with the adjustment as well.</p><p>The use of NPPV is not a substitute for permanent assisted ventilation, and careful decision making regarding desire for tracheostomy and permanent ventilation must be ongoing, whether or not NPPV is employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When long-term survival is the goal, invasive ventilation should be offered. The patient and family should be fully informed of the burdens and benefits of this treatment, including the option to stop the ventilation at any time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For patients who choose to stop invasive ventilation, symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and distress should be anticipated and treated. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dyspnea'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients, the demands of invasive ventilation are difficult or impossible to manage at home, and nursing home placement results. Fewer than 10 percent of patients with ALS choose invasive ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Invasive mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Diaphragmatic pacing is a second line therapy for patients with ventilatory failure due to bilateral or severe paresis of the diaphragm. While direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation (DPS) has been performed as a lone therapy in some patients with ALS who have a sufficient number of intact functional phrenic nerve motor fibers, the efficacy is limited and short-lived. In addition, safety is uncertain when DPS is used in combination with noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, DPS remains investigational until large randomized trials clarify whether it is safe and beneficial. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all individuals with chronic pulmonary conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therefore, patients with ALS should be treated with pneumococcal vaccination and annual seasonal influenza vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSPHAGIA AND NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia increases the risk for insufficient caloric and fluid intake and worsening of weakness and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. It also increases the risk for aspiration and choking.

In addition, nutritional supplementation using PEG may be helpful for stabilizing weight loss common in ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There is little or no evidence regarding the impact of PEG on quality of life in ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Given these data, we suggest PEG placement for willing patients with ALS who have symptomatic dysphagia, and for those who develop significant weight loss even in the absence of dysphagia. PEG placement should first be discussed with the patient and family members. It is best to enlist a speech-language pathologist and nutritionist early in the treatment when potential decisions about long-term feeding and hydration are entertained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrostomy tubes: Uses, patient selection, and efficacy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For optimal safety and efficacy, PEG should be placed before the vital capacity falls to 50 percent of predicted and not in the preterminal phase, even if symptomatic dysphagia is not present at that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This recommendation is based on the increased morbidity of the procedure as respiratory function declines.</p><p>In a preliminary randomized controlled trial of 24 patients with ALS already receiving percutaneous nutrition, there were fewer adverse events, including death, over the course of the trial (four months) and subsequent follow-up (five months) in patients assigned to a high-carbohydrate, hypercaloric diet compared with those assigned to a high-fat, hypercaloric diet or an isocaloric diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These results suggest, but do not establish, that the high-carbohydrate, hypercaloric enteral diet is safe. However, they do <strong>not</strong> provide evidence of efficacy regarding improvement in survival or other patient-important outcomes, given the small number of subjects with relatively advanced disease who were studied. Larger trials are needed to determine whether this approach can prolong survival or slow disease progression in patients with ALS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the prominent symptoms of ALS addressed by national guidelines are dyspnea, muscle spasm, spasticity, sialorrhea, and pseudobulbar affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/abstract/4-6,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,33</a>].</p><p>Equally important and potentially debilitating are other problems associated with ALS. These include dysarthria, muscle weakness, functional decline, loss of ambulation, pain, sleep problems, and psychosocial issues such as depression.

Opioids should be employed early to treat breathlessness and not just at end-stage disease. Treatment begins with a starting dose of 2.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sulfate equivalents every four hours. The dose should be increased by 30 percent every 12 hours until dyspnea is improved or intolerable side effects develop. When adequate symptom relief is obtained, convert to a long-acting preparation such as oral or transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>. For breakthrough dyspnea (ie, acute exacerbations above baseline dyspnea), breakthrough doses are used, which are 10 percent of the total daily dose given as needed every hour for oral drugs or every 30 minutes for parenteral drugs.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) die within three to five years of diagnosis. However, longer survival is not rare. Patients who receive multidisciplinary care at specialized ALS clinics appear to have improved survival compared with those who are followed by general neurology clinics. Palliative care should be provided at the time of diagnosis. Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and does not have to be limited to end-of-life care. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before respiratory symptoms occur in ALS, it is crucial to inform patients both of the available respiratory management choices and the need for their participation in the decision-making process. At all stages of the disease, patients have the right to refuse or withdraw any treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with ALS, we suggest serial assessment of pulmonary function every three months starting at the time of diagnosis. Useful measures include the vital capacity (VC), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal sniff nasal inspiratory force (SNIF). The SNIF avoids the need for a mouthpiece and thus may be better suited than the VC or MIP for testing patients with bulbar weakness. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ALS and respiratory compromise, we suggest the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Suggested criteria for when to initiate NPPV are as follows (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VC &lt;50 percent of predicted, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of orthopnea, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>SNIF &lt;40 cm, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MIP &lt;-60 cm, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal nocturnal oximetry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When long-term survival is the goal, invasive ventilation is an option. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Invasive ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ALS should be treated with pneumococcal vaccination and annual seasonal influenza vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For willing patients with ALS who have symptomatic dysphagia, we suggest percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, we suggest PEG for those who develop significant weight loss even in the absence of dysphagia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For optimal safety, PEG should be placed before the vital capacity falls to &le;50 percent of predicted. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dysphagia and nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional prominent symptoms of ALS may benefit from specific interventions. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysarthria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dyspnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle spasms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle spasticity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle weakness and functional decline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sialorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thick mucus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pseudobulbar affect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psychosocial aspects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleep problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there are few controlled trials evaluating these issues in patients with ALS. Thus, most recommendations are based upon clinical experience and expert consensus. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As ALS progresses and the expected prognosis is six months or less, or when goals shift exclusively to comfort, hospice should become involved.
