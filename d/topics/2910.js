This is performed by either a CRT-pacemaker (CRT-P) or by a combined CRT-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (CRT-D). CRT devices include a transvenous pacing lead placed in a branch of the coronary sinus (or, less commonly, an epicardial or endocardial LV lead) for LV pacing, in addition to leads in the RV and right atrium. These leads are attached to a pulse generator typically located in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper chest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-implantation-and-other-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Implantation and other considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of the indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) overlap with those for CRT. The indications and evidence for ICD use are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3868544976\" class=\"local\">'Evidence'</a> below.)</p><p>Observational studies suggest that electrical dyssynchrony (manifest as a prolonged QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram [ECG]) is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Approximately one-third of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have a &quot;wide&quot; QRS complex, defined as &gt;120 ms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mortality among patients with HFrEF increases with increasing QRS complex duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is itself associated with increased mortality among patients with HFrEF of any etiology, whereas right bundle branch block is not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>These observations prompted studies demonstrating that LV electromechanical activation in patients with native or pacing-induced LBBB is hemodynamically disadvantageous. In the cardiomyopathic state, this inefficiency further reduces cardiac output, exacerbates functional mitral regurgitation, and worsens adverse LV remodeling (ie, dilatation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Electroanatomic mapping of the LV demonstrates that LBBB is associated with delayed activation of the basal posterolateral wall compared with nearly simultaneous electrical activation in the setting of normal His-Purkinje activation. This mechanical &quot;dyssynchrony&quot; was first observed with echocardiographic M-mode imaging, followed by tissue Doppler imaging and, later, speckle-tracking strain imaging. In the presence of LBBB, mechanical activation of the posterolateral LV is typically delayed compared with the interventricular septum, mirroring the findings from electroanatomic mapping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800250200\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among those who respond to CRT, this therapy induces immediate hemodynamic benefits, improves left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and promotes LV reverse remodeling, whereby the LV decreases in size and becomes less spherical. Acute hemodynamic benefits of CRT include increased systolic blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and increased contractility <span class=\"nowrap\">(dP/dt)</span>. In the CARE-HF trial, CRT therapy was associated with increases in LV ejection fraction of 3.7 percent at three months and 6.9 percent at 18 months and decreases in LV end-systolic volume index by 16.7 percent at three months and 29.6 percent at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These findings highlight the fact that CRT has progressive structural benefits. Unlike inotrope therapy, CRT increases myocardial contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. </p><p>The molecular mechanisms of CRT are poorly understood; this therapy is associated with potentially beneficial upregulation of heart failure-related genes, including <span class=\"nowrap\">sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic</span> reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban, and the beta-1 adrenergic receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The clinical benefits of CRT are discussed below.

The efficacy of CRT in this population is not established. The rationale for CRT in this setting is based upon indirect evidence from trials in patients with LVEF &le;35 percent and a single trial in pacemaker candidates.

Only CRT-D devices provide antitachycardia pacing or high-energy shocks to terminate potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias; their use also risks the possibility of inappropriate shocks.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue the therapy should be informed by best estimates of both benefits and risks in the context of shared decision making, which is defined as selecting therapy from the reasonable options that is aligned with the patient&rsquo;s values, goals, and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Indeed, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> guidelines specifically recommend informed shared decision making as integral to the provision of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and CRT therapy. Because many patients considered for CRT have advanced symptomatic HF, the discussion about device therapy will be part of a larger discussion about prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies#H1323782964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Indications and strategies&quot;, section on 'Disease course and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>The capacity to estimate the benefits of CRT varies substantially based upon patient characteristics. In cases where benefits are not well established, the limitations of existing data should be openly acknowledged in the decision making process. A patient-level analysis of five randomized trials of CRT found that quality of life (QoL) benefits at three months were predicted by patient age, baseline QoL, and QRS duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Such statistical models may be useful in determining the likely advantages of undergoing CRT implantation. Further, clinicians must also elicit and consider the patient&rsquo;s care-related goals and preferences in order to achieve a shared decision making process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3128872544\"><span class=\"h2\">Individualized risk-benefit assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because CRT is associated with risk, both acutely during implantation and chronically, the risk-benefit ratio of CRT implant must be considered in each individual patient, particularly in those with less robust indications. </p><p>The CRT implantation procedure is longer, entails more procedural risk, and may increase the risk of infection compared with standard ICD or pacemaker implantations. Left ventricular (LV) leads have an increased risk of dislodgment or pacing the phrenic nerve compared with traditional right ventricular leads. Battery longevity is generally shorter for CRT devices compared with conventional ICDs or pacemakers.</p><p>Another consideration is that not all patients with similar indications for CRT derive similar benefits, but a means of identifying patients with indications for CRT who will fail to benefit has not been established. Approximately one-third of CRT recipients are deemed &quot;nonresponders&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], although the definition of &quot;response&quot; is not standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Definitions of response include improvement in exercise capacity, improved QoL via standardized assessments, improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) status by at least one class, prevention of HF hospitalizations, and LV reverse remodeling.

In the REPLACE registry, the six-month major complication rate for CRT upgrades was 18.7 percent, compared with 4.0 percent for patients undergoing generator change only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The threshold for upgrading an existing device to CRT is thus higher than for a de novo implant.

The patient supported by an LVAD is unlikely to benefit from CRT because the LV is completely unloaded, and LV cardiac output is almost entirely subsumed by the device. De novo CRT should not be provided to these patients. The benefits of preexisting CRT in this population are not known. It is our practice to deactivate CRT in patients with LVADs, as LV pacing significantly drains the battery. If patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias have recurrences with CRT deactivation, anecdotal experience suggests that reactivation may reduce the risk of recurrent arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inotrope-dependent patients have a markedly increased risk of death, need for cardiac transplant, or transition to LVAD support even with CRT as compared with non-inotrope-dependent patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1748463281\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for CRT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for CRT for patients in sinus rhythm are based upon LV ejection fraction (LVEF), QRS duration, QRS morphology, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and need for ventricular pacing. The recommendations are predicated on a discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the procedure in the context of shared decision making. The approach is as follows (see <a href=\"#H2802650575\" class=\"local\">'CRT indications in sinus rhythm'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>For patients with LVEF &le;35 percent</strong> &ndash; The following general indications apply to patients with LVEF &le;35 percent on optimal evidence-based medical therapy for at least three months after initial diagnosis (or for at least 40 days after myocardial infarction) and after identification and treatment of any reversible causes of persistent HF (such as myocardial ischemia or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115693\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115693 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H79029487\" class=\"local\">'For patients with LVEF &le;35 percent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H550032740\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for general indications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>QRS &ge;150 ms with LBBB</strong> &ndash; For patients with QRS &ge;150 ms with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and NYHA class II to ambulatory class IV HF, we recommend referral for CRT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

Patients with ICM with LVEF &le;30 percent on medical therapy also meet criteria for ICD placement. <br/><br/>Based on indirect evidence from patients with ICM, some experts (including the authors of this topic) also refer patients with NYHA class I HF and nonischemic cardiomyopathy for an individualized risk-benefit assessment of CRT. These patients do not generally meet criteria for ICD placement.

The efficacy of CRT in this population is not established. The rationale for CRT in this setting is based upon indirect evidence from trials in patients with LVEF &le;35 percent and a single trial in pacemaker candidates.
