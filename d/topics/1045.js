Less commonly, they can arise from the gynecologic or urinary tract. Abdominal infections are usually polymicrobial and result in an intra-abdominal abscess or secondary peritonitis, which may be generalized or localized (phlegmon). </p><p>The approach to antimicrobial selection and administration for intra-abdominal infections in adults is discussed here. The general and surgical management of these infections are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The precise microbiological spectrum depends on the precise gastrointestinal source (ie, small versus large bowel). </p><p>Colonic flora is especially common in intra-abdominal infections, reflecting the frequency of associated diseases at this anatomic site, including appendicitis, diverticulitis, carcinoma of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease, and previous colon surgery. Thus, the predominant bacteria involved in such infections are coliforms (mainly <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, <em>Proteus</em> spp, and <em>Enterobacter</em> spp) streptococci, enterococci, and anaerobic bacteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66936 \">picture 1</a>). However, while colonic flora consists of approximately 400 species, an average of only four to six species are generally recovered from these intra-abdominal infections. The dominant isolates in most series are <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> and <em>E. coli</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79147 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. The probable factors contributing to this phenomenon include the limited ability of clinical laboratories to isolate all the different organisms as well as the ability of specific organisms to cause infection and survive based upon their virulence factors and capacity to adapt to new environmental conditions. For example, the capacity of <em>B. fragilis</em> to tolerate small amounts of oxygen contributes to its emergence as a highly invasive anaerobic pathogen in abdominal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Experimental animal studies of intra-abdominal sepsis suggest that both anaerobes and coliforms contribute to the pathogenesis although they play different roles, with coliforms contributing to early sepsis and anaerobes implicated in the late sequelae with abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-clues-and-recovery-of-organisms-in-anaerobic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical clues, and recovery of organisms in anaerobic infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Perforation of the proximal bowel, as with perforated peptic ulcer, results in an infection that is microbiologically distinct, reflecting the flora of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The predominant microbial species in such cases often include aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria or <em>Candida</em> spp. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease#H4460621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'Perforation'</a>.)</p><p>Prior antimicrobial therapy and health care exposures are associated with microbiologic changes in the bowel flora, and intra-abdominal infections in such settings are thus more likely to involve nosocomial pathogens, such as <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other drug-resistant organisms. Enterococci are most likely to be clinically relevant in health care-associated infections, particularly postoperative infections, in contrast to community-acquired infections, in which they are frequently isolated but are often not important pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. <em>Candida</em> spp are also more common, in both small and large bowel processes, among patients with hospital-acquired infection, prior antibiotic exposure, immunocompromising conditions, or with recurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H721251720\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for specific pathogens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H939068707\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCE CONTROL AND DRAINAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> percutaneous drainage are usually critical to the management of intra-abdominal infections other than spontaneous peritonitis. Surgical intervention may be required to close an anatomic breach or debride infected necrotic tissue, and drainage is usually necessary for clearance of an abscess. When feasible, percutaneous abscess drainage is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most clinical treatment failures are due to failure to achieve such source control. </p><p>Surgical or percutaneous intervention also affords the opportunity for collection of primary specimens for microbiologic analysis (Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and if appropriate, fungal and mycobacterial studies). This is particularly important for those patients with intra-abdominal abscesses or otherwise complicated infections, with prior antibiotic exposure, or with a high risk of infection with resistant organisms. Gram stain of the specimen can provide early guidance for antibiotic selection and may be the only source of information if cultures do not grow. Inoculating the specimen directly into blood culture bottles can increase the microbiologic yield, but this approach has several drawbacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. It forfeits the ability to obtain Gram stain results, unless a separate specimen is collected for Gram stain, and in polymicrobial infections, competitive growth in blood culture bottles can hinder identification of all important pathogens, so cultures with routine media are also important in such cases. </p><p>The surgical management of intra-abdominal processes is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute appendicitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management#H432565371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management&quot;, section on 'Choosing a surgical technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;, section on 'Biliary drainage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation#H12750262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;, section on 'Indications for abdominal exploration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721251431\"><span class=\"h1\">EMPIRIC ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864003476\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are critically ill should receive empiric antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible, ideally once blood and urine samples have been obtained for culture. In patients who are not critically ill, delaying antibiotic therapy until samples from the site of abdominal infection have been obtained for culture can be helpful to optimize the microbiologic yield that guides subsequent antibiotic selection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90328678\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, empiric regimens for intra-abdominal infections include antimicrobial activity against enteric streptococci, coliforms, and anaerobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106948 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106949 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106950\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106950 \">table 4</a>). Studies evaluating the relative efficacy of different antibiotic regimens with these spectra of activity have generally demonstrated equivalent efficacy (see <a href=\"#H721251601\" class=\"local\">'General principles of regimen selection'</a> below). The precise antimicrobial regimen and indications for broader antimicrobial coverage depend upon several factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105865 \">table 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the infection is community-acquired versus health care-associated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether there are individual risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria (such as recent travel to areas of the world that have high rates of antibiotic-resistant organisms or known colonization with such organisms).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the patient is considered to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. High-risk features that are associated with poor outcomes after intra-abdominal infection are advanced age (&gt;70 years), delay in initial intervention &gt;24 hours, inability to achieve adequate debridement or control of infection with drainage, other comorbidity (eg, renal or liver disease, malignancy), immunocompromising condition (eg, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, chronic high-dose corticosteroid use, use of other immunosuppressive agents, neutropenia, advanced HIV infection, B or T lymphocyte defects), organ dysfunction, severe peritoneal involvement or diffuse peritonitis, low albumin level, and poor nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/11,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14-16</a>]. </p><p/><p>Patients with community-acquired infections of mild to moderate severity who have none of these risk factors may not warrant very broad coverage, as the likelihood of resistant bacteria is low and the consequences of not covering them empirically are less. In contrast, broad coverage is appropriate in patients who are at risk for infection with resistant bacteria or who are at risk for adverse outcomes and mortality should empiric antibiotic therapy not be adequate. Thus, regimen selection is somewhat different for these different populations. (See <a href=\"#H864002660\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk community-acquired infections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H864002785\" class=\"local\">'High-risk community-acquired infections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H864002888\" class=\"local\">'Health care-associated infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Other factors that influence the choice of regimen include the location or type of infection (ie, gram-negative anaerobes are generally not critical pathogens in infections arising from the upper gastrointestinal tract), whether there is a plan for surgical intervention, the local rates of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and expected patient tolerance. Rates of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae are high in certain parts of the world, including east Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and are especially high in southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Travelers from these areas are at risk for colonization with resistant bacteria; this risk generally lasts a few weeks but can be prolonged in those with diarrhea or antibiotic exposure during travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>Overarching these considerations are goals for antibiotic stewardship, which generally favor narrower rather than broader coverage when possible.</p><p>The suggested regimens in the following sections are intended to provide general guidance and may need to be altered to cover emerging resistance patterns that are specific to the hospital or region; this is more likely to be necessary for the aerobic component but could also apply to the anaerobic component.</p><p>These recommendations are also generally in keeping with the joint Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections, which were published in 2010. The SIS published updated guidelines in 2017, while the IDSA guidelines are in the process of revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].

For patients who have had adequate source control, we suggest limiting antibiotic therapy to four to five days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Longer, but discrete, courses are appropriate if source control is suboptimal or uncertain.
