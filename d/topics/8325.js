The lung infection is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also be caused by viruses or other germs.</p><p>Doctors use the term &quot;hospital-acquired&quot; when a person catches an infection during a hospital stay. Doctors use the term &quot;community-acquired&quot; when a person catches an infection in their daily life.</p><p>Hospital-acquired pneumonia is usually more serious than community-acquired pneumonia. That's because people who get hospital-acquired pneumonia are usually sick to start with.</p><p>One type of hospital-acquired pneumonia is called &quot;ventilator-associated pneumonia.&quot; It happens in people who have a breathing tube and are attached to a breathing machine, called a ventilator.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9945237\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hospital-acquired pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of hospital-acquired pneumonia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing up mucus that is yellow or green</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing much faster than usual</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9945252\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hospital-acquired pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for a lung infection, the doctor will do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of mucus that is coughed up &ndash; Sometimes, the doctor needs to put a tube into the lungs to get a sample of mucus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9945267\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hospital-acquired pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat hospital-acquired pneumonia with antibiotic medicines. These medicines kill the germs that are causing the infection. People usually get these medicines through a thin tube that goes into their vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>The medicines used to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia are sometimes different than those used to treat community-acquired pneumonia. That's because the germs that cause hospital-acquired pneumonia are more likely to be &quot;resistant&quot; to antibiotics. This means they are harder to kill. Because of this, doctors often treat hospital-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics that work against resistant bacteria. Sometimes, doctors use more than one antibiotic at the same time.</p><p>Some people with hospital-acquired pneumonia are also treated with extra oxygen to help them breathe more easily. Extra oxygen can be given through 2 small tubes that fit into your nostrils or through a mask that goes over your nose and mouth. People who are very sick sometimes get oxygen through a special breathing tube that goes in the mouth and down into the lungs. The other end of the tube is attached to a breathing machine.</p><p>Most people start to feel better within a few days of starting treatment. But a cough from pneumonia can last weeks or months after treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9945282\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hospital-acquired pneumonia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hospital, doctors and nurses do certain things to try to prevent people from getting hospital-acquired pneumonia. For example, they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash their hands often to avoid spreading germs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove a person's breathing tube as soon as he or she no longer needs it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the head of the bed when a person is on a breathing machine to reduce the chance that fluids in the mouth and throat will go into the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9945297\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
