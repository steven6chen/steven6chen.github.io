This is a condition in which the liver does not work the way it should. It can cause symptoms such as tiredness and swelling in the legs and belly. It can also make the skin or whites of the eyes look yellow. This is called &quot;jaundice.&quot; People with some types of liver cancer might also need a liver transplant.</p><p>Before you have a liver transplant, your doctor will try other treatments. Your doctor will only recommend a liver transplant if no other treatments work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94655169\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens before I can get a liver transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you get a liver transplant, you need to go through several steps.</p><p>Your doctor will send you to a liver transplant center (a hospital that does liver transplants). If you are very sick, you might stay in the hospital. You will have exams and blood tests and talk with different doctors. Doctors will ask you about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your other medical conditions and medicines you take</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your lifestyle (for example, alcohol, drug use, or smoking)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your family and other support systems</p><p/><p>Not everyone who goes to a liver transplant center gets a transplant. To be considered, you must meet certain conditions. For example, you must:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe liver disease that has not gotten better with other treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have serious heart and lung disease, such as COPD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have certain forms of cancer now or in the last 5 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not use alcohol or drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be willing to take medicines for the rest of your life after surgery</p><p/><p>If you meet all these conditions, you will be put on a waiting list for a new liver. An organization called &quot;UNOS&quot; keeps track of everyone on the list. UNOS tries to give livers to the sickest people first. Your doctors will let UNOS know if your liver disease gets worse.</p><p>A few people get a liver transplant from a friend or family member who gives part of his or her liver. For example, a parent might give part of a liver to a child. But most people get a new liver from UNOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94655186\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens when a liver becomes available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a liver becomes available, UNOS chooses the person who is the best match for it. People who are waiting for a liver need to carry a cell phone or pager at all times so that they can be reached quickly.</p><p>When you get called for your liver transplant, you will need to get to the hospital quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94655203\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a liver transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for a few weeks before going home. Your doctors will do tests regularly to make sure that your new liver is working correctly.</p><p>After a liver transplant, people need to take medicines for the rest of their life. These medicines are called &quot;anti-rejection medicines.&quot; They help the body's infection-fighting system accept the new liver. Normally, the infection-fighting system helps people stay healthy by attacking objects in the body that came in from the outside (&quot;foreign objects&quot;). Anti-rejection medicines help keep the body from attacking the new liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94655218\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can people have after a liver transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people do well after surgery. They can go to work and be active. But other people have problems right after the surgery or a few years later. These problems can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rejection of the new liver &ndash; Even though people take anti-rejection medicines, their body might still reject and attack the new liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease that comes back &ndash; Some liver diseases can come back after a transplant, though not all do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects from the anti-rejection medicines &ndash; These medicines have short-term side effects. For example, they increase a person's chance of getting infections. They also have long-term side effects. For example, they can increase the chance of certain types of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94655233\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Liver cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
