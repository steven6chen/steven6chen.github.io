We prefer to individualize the radioiodine dose based upon the size of the thyroid gland and the 24-hour radioiodine uptake.

(See <a href=\"#H30632391\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypothyroidism is less common initially after radioiodine treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (MNG). Areas of focal autonomy take up radioiodine well, while uptake is limited in adjacent and contralateral thyroid tissue that is suppressed by the hyperthyroid state. As a result, radioiodine tends to destroy only the autonomous areas, and most patients remain euthyroid after radioiodine administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Patients who develop hypothyroidism usually do so because uptake was not suppressed in the extranodular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] or because of coexistent chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In up to 4 percent of patients with toxic MNG, radioiodine therapy may evoke the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor-stimulating antibodies, causing recurrent hyperthyroidism (due to Graves' disease) several months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Graves' disease</strong> &ndash; When radioiodine is used to treat patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, we suggest high-dose therapy (150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/g</span> [5.9 to 7.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">MBq/g])</span>. This will cure the hyperthyroidism and, in most patients, induce hypothyroidism in 12 to 18 weeks. Patients should then be started on full replacement doses of T4 if goiter is absent or slightly lower doses if goiter persists. A persistent goiter suggests incomplete destruction of the gland and the possibility of persistent autonomous thyroid tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism recommend a dose (typically 10 to 15 millicuries [mCi; 370 to 555 MBq]) sufficient to cause hypothyroidism, which can be accomplished equally well with either a fixed or individualized dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with Graves' disease, the dose of radioiodine is directly related to the cure rate and the incidence of hypothyroidism. As an example, in a trial of two fixed doses of radioiodine (5 versus 10 mCi equivalent to 185 versus 370 MBq) in 813 patients with hyperthyroidism, patients treated with the higher dose had a higher cure rate (85 versus 67 percent) and a higher incidence of hypothyroidism (61 versus 41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In particular, low-dose radioiodine therapy is more likely to result in treatment failure, necessitating another dose in 6 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

The goal of individualized dosing is to maximize cure and avoid unnecessarily high radiation exposures in patients with high radioiodine uptake. The use of a fixed dose of radioiodine is an alternative approach. Fixed dosing simplifies the approach to treatment and is less costly than an individually calculated dose. Fixed doses of 5, 10, or 15 mCi (185, 370, or 555 MBq) are commonly given to patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism.</p><p>One prospective, randomized trial compared a fixed dose with a calculated dose and reported an inverse relationship between therapeutic success and thyroid size in the patients treated with a fixed dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Success rates ranged from 100 percent for patients with thyroid volumes &le;15 mL to only 25 percent in patients with volume &ge;75 mL. In another study, a semiquantitative fixed dose regimen (5 mCi [185 MBq] for patients with small glands, 10 mCi [370 MBq] for those with medium glands, and 15 mCi [555 MBq] for those with large glands) was as effective as more elaborately calculated individual dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These data favor an individualized approach to dosing because of the dependence of outcome on gland size.</p><p>However, other data favor a fixed approach. As an example, in a randomized trial comparing one of four dose methods (low fixed, high fixed, low calculated, high calculated) in 88 patients with Graves' disease, fixed doses of 6.4 mCi (235 MBq) or 9.4 mCi (350 MBq) were as effective as low- or high-calculated doses (80 or 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/g)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 63 months, the majority of patients (57 to 82 percent) were hypothyroid. Hyperthyroidism was present in 18 to 27 percent, and 0 to 19 percent were euthyroid. Clinical outcome was not related to the administered radioiodine dose (hyperthyroid, 334 MBq; euthyroid, 309 MBq; hypothyroid, 334 MBq).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3416416417\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose calculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When calculating the dose of radioiodine to be administered to a patient, we prefer to correct the dose according to the 24-hour uptake. As an example, suppose that one wanted to deliver 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">microCi/g</span> thyroid tissue to a patient whose thyroid gland size was approximately 30 g with a 24-hour uptake of 60 percent.

The doses of radioiodine administered for the treatment of hyperthyroidism are much lower than those for thyroid cancer, and a larger fraction of the dose is taken up by the thyroid tissue, requiring less clearance by the kidney immediately after dosing.

No increased risk was seen during follow-up in patients taking thyroid hormone therapy. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (not receiving thyroid hormone) had excess mortality related to ischemic heart disease.
