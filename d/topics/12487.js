Similar to MAC, the risk of disease from other NTM increases with progressive immunodeficiency, with the greatest risk experienced as the CD4 cell count decreases below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Prior to the widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients developed disseminated disease caused by MAC; localized infection with MAC is now more common. By contrast, infection with other NTM can be disseminated or localized. The clinical manifestations vary among the NTM species, and the accurate diagnosis of true infection can be a challenge.</p><p>The most commonly isolated NTM species, their clinical manifestations in patients with HIV infection, and recommendations for treatment will be reviewed here. The microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of NTM in patients without HIV are discussed separately.

However, when NTM are isolated from non-sterile sites, such as sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, the diagnosis is less definitive, especially when the colony numbers are low or the isolate is present in only one cultured specimen. A diagnosis of infection then depends upon other clinical findings and the presence or absence of other pathogens. Organisms considered in other circumstances to be commensals can be opportunistic pathogens in patients with advanced HIV disease and immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A case series from Spain identified 26 HIV-infected patients between 1998 and 2005 with NTM isolates from sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Further reports of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection with new NTM strains characterized by their unique 16S ribosomal RNA continue, adding to a growing list of rare pathogens for which diagnosis and treatment are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the Spanish study noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], MAC and <em>M. kansasii</em> caused all disease, whereas other NTM were considered to be colonizers.</p><p>The most recent recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), updated in 2007, serve as a useful guide to the diagnosis and treatment of NTM disease in patients with or without HIV coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Species identification is usually made through traditional biochemical testing of isolates; results often are not available for weeks. Newer molecular testing methods of clinical specimens, using direct amplification of nucleic acid probes (Gen-Probe and AccuProbe) to rapidly identify <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>M. kansasii</em>, and MAC, can produce results in hours. However, false low-level positive tests for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> have been reported in specimens that later grew NTM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], illustrating the need for caution when using these newer tests.</p><p>Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), the paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes after the start of combination antiretroviral therapy, has been frequently described among HIV-infected patients with known or previously undiagnosed mycobacterial infection, both tuberculous and non-tuberculous. The vast majority of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections resulting in IRIS are due to MAC, but cases of IRIS related to infection with a variety of NTM other than MAC have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Typical symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, cough with sputum, dyspnea, and weakness. Pulmonary disease consists of infiltrates on chest radiograph with isolation of the organism from at least two respiratory specimens. The presentation of <em>M. kansasii</em> pulmonary infection usually does not differ in those who are HIV-infected or not, but the incidence of disseminated infection with this organism is higher in HIV-infected patients. Disseminated disease can be diagnosed by isolation of <em>M. kansasii</em> from sites other than the respiratory system, hilar lymph nodes, or skin.</p><p>In the series of 46 patients from Florida, the median CD4 count in HIV-infected patients with <em>M. kansasii</em> infection was <span class=\"nowrap\">34/mm3</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Forty-two patients (91 percent) had pulmonary infection; six of these cases also had disseminated disease. Only four (8 percent) of the patients had extrapulmonary disease without accompanying pulmonary involvement. The extrapulmonary sites included adenitis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and pericarditis.</p><p>A population-based survey from California during 1992 to 1996 identified 270 infections with <em>M. kansasii</em>, and found that 69.3 percent of these cases were among HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with HIV infection were more likely to have mycobacteremia (9.6 percent versus 0 percent) and smear-positive respiratory specimens (41.7 percent versus 20.7 percent). Hospitalization for treatment was more common in the HIV-infected group.</p><p>A case-control study from Spain compared the clinical presentations of <em>M. kansasii</em> and <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in HIV-infected patients and found that presenting symptoms and rates of dissemination were similar, but patients with <em>M. kansasii</em> presented with lower CD4 cell counts (median of 20 versus 90 for <em>M. tuberculosis</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-excluding-mac-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When NTM are isolated from a sterile site (eg, blood), the diagnosis of true disease is generally straightforward. However, when NTM are isolated from non-sterile sites, such as sputum, the diagnosis is less definitive. In the latter situation, a diagnosis of true NTM infection depends upon other clinical findings and the presence or absence of other potential pathogens.
