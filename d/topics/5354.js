CKD patients have a higher mortality than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mortality is related in part to the progression of kidney disease and its complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and protein-energy wasting.</p><p>Dietary factors may have an effect on the progression of kidney disease and its complications. Among CKD patients, overnutrition results in sodium and volume overload, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and accumulation of toxic metabolites of protein degradation. Undernutrition, on the other hand, exacerbates the risk for malnutrition and wasting.</p><p>Appropriate dietary interventions may have an effect on clinical outcomes in the CKD population. However, the optimal approach to nutrition is not known with certainty, and clinical trials have yielded conflicting results.</p><p>This topic review provides recommendations for nutrition for predialysis CKD patients. Recommendations for nutrition in the general public are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to nutrition in dialysis patients is discussed elsewhere.

For most CKD patients, the optimal diet is one similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, consisting of low sodium, fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diet in the treatment and prevention of hypertension&quot;, section on 'Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial'</a>.)</p><p>However, among many patients, the diet needs to be modified further depending on specific laboratory values including serum potassium or serum phosphorus.</p><p>We do not suggest any dietary modification for patients with eGFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Such patients should follow the same dietary recommendations as for the general population.

Among individuals who are hypertensive, volume overloaded, or proteinuric, we suggest a sodium intake of &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (ie, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of salt [NaCl]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are not hypertensive, volume overloaded, or proteinuric, sodium restriction to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (5.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of salt [NaCl]) may be of benefit. There are no convincing studies of the general population that have proven that lowering sodium intake to &lt;2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> lowers cardiovascular outcomes or all-cause mortality. The Institute of Medicine has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a different sodium intake for CKD patients as compared with the general US population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potassium intake should be guided by serum potassium levels.

Nutritional studies in patients with reduced eGFR suggest that protein intake can be safely lowered to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], although a very-low-protein diet has been associated with increased mortality over the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A modest restriction is generally well tolerated and does not lead to malnutrition in patients with CKD, and metabolic acidosis is avoided.</p><p>Most clinical guidelines, including Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), suggest restriction in protein intake for CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Studies that have examined protein restriction have yielded inconsistent results, but the balance of evidence suggests a benefit of moderate dietary protein restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Many early studies suggested that protein restriction may slow progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>], although more recent and rigorous studies suggest that the benefit is modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8,17-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17-26</a>]. The largest trial to date, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, analyzed 585 patients with nondiabetic CKD and a mean GFR of 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (all patients with GFR &lt;55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to protein intakes of 1.3 or 0.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> with or without aggressive blood pressure (BP) control and followed for a mean of 2.2 years. The mean achieved protein intake was 1.11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> for the usual-protein-diet group and 0.77 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> (approximately 45 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> for the low-protein-diet group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This level of protein intake is substantially below the average protein intake in the United States of 90 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>.</p><p>Despite good compliance, initially, there appeared to be little overall benefit with the low-protein diet. A biphasic response was noted: Patients treated with protein restriction had a greater fall in GFR (measured by iothalamate clearance) in the first four months (that may have reflected a reduction in intraglomerular pressure), followed by somewhat slower progression over the ensuing months (2.8 versus 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/year)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59277 \">figure 1</a>). Interpretation of the MDRD trial is somewhat limited by this since the trial design did not account for this two-slope change in GFR in the moderate-protein-intake group. However, even in the later phase, the absolute benefit was approximately 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/year</span>. A similar lack of substantial benefit was noted in a second part of this study involving 255 patients with more advanced disease (mean GFR 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) who were randomly assigned to a low-protein diet (0.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> or a very-low-protein diet (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> with a keto acid-amino acid supplement.</p><p>Other limitations to the trial are that it included very few diabetic patients (patients with insulin-requiring diabetes were excluded) and the rate of decline in GFR in the intervention and control groups was slower than expected, which may have resulted in decreased power to discern potential benefit. As the curves diverged at the end of the study, there is a possibility that longer-term follow-up of these patients would have revealed a slower progression in the moderate-protein-intake group.</p><p>A benefit of moderate protein restriction was suggested by a long-term follow-up analysis of the MDRD study, which was performed by linking the MDRD study to national registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this 12-year study (1989 to 2000), the authors evaluated outcomes during the first six years after the trial ended (1989 to 1994), the next six-year period (1995 to 2000), and the total 12-year period. Analysis of outcomes after the first six years revealed a significant benefit of low-protein intake on renal failure and all-cause mortality (hazard ratios [HRs] 0.68, CI 0.51-0.93 and 0.66, CI 0.50-0.87, respectively). However, there was no benefit of protein restriction when outcomes between 6 and 12 years were analyzed, but protein intake data were not available following the completion of the randomized study phase. Thus, it is possible that the early beneficial effects in the first six years dissipated after six years because the study participants were no longer on the intervention.</p><p>These data suggest the need for a longer follow-up period for future studies designed to assess the effects of protein restriction intervention. In the MDRD study, the average rate of GFR decline was 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year during the mean duration of 2.2 years, and relatively few patients developed renal failure during this period. It is possible that the study duration was too short to fully appreciate the effect of protein restriction.</p><p>Since the initial MDRD report in 1994, several secondary analyses of the MDRD study, as well as other meta-analyses and controlled trials, have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Systematic reviews suggest that protein restriction may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. As an example, a Cochrane review limited to studies that used renal death as an outcome measure (n = 10) demonstrated a protective effect of protein restriction despite heterogeneity among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Renal death in this review was defined as the need for starting dialysis, the death of the patient, or a kidney transplant. This analysis suggested that protein restriction decreases the number of patients reaching the defined outcome by approximately 32 percent. This equates to treating 2 to 56 patients with a low-protein diet to avoid one renal death.</p><p>Overall, most experts believe that, despite the absence of observed benefit in the MDRD trial, the balance of evidence suggests a benefit of moderate dietary protein restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Some of the MDRD investigators have proposed that the seemingly small benefit from protein restriction may be clinically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. According to this reasoning, a patient with a GFR of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> who is losing 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year will require dialysis in approximately eight years. However, if the rate of fall were only 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per year, then 11 years would be required to reach the same endpoint. Thus, the absolute benefit would be three years without dialysis.</p><p>In addition, protein restriction may be particularly effective in diseases characterized by hyperfiltration, such as diabetes and certain glomerulopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18</a>], although one study has suggested that the effects of protein restriction in advanced renal disease due to polycystic kidney are similar to that due to other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is not characterized by hyperfiltration and tends to have a very different rate of progression compared with diabetic and other glomerulopathies.</p><p>Limiting protein intake is also associated with favorable laboratory and metabolic effects, including reduction of blood urea nitrogen levels, uremic toxins, and acid load, in addition to reduced phosphorus load with better control of metabolic bone disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A modest protein restriction to 0.6 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> appears to be safe. The safety profile of a modest protein restriction was assessed in an analysis of patients who were enrolled in the MDRD study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to a standard-protein diet (1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day),</span> a low-protein diet (0.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day),</span> or a very-low-protein diet (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> supplemented with a ketoacid-amino acid mixture at 0.28 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> based upon their GFR. Patients assigned to the low-protein diet achieved a protein intake between 0.6 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span>. Patients assigned to the very-low-protein diet achieved a protein intake between 0.4 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span>.</p><p>At a mean follow-up of 2.2 years, a low-protein intake was not associated with increased rates of mortality, hospitalization, or malnutrition.</p><p>We do not recommend very-low-protein intake (&lt;0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day),</span> due to the safety concerns. Significant health risks are associated with more severe restrictions over the long term. The MDRD study tested the effects of low-protein diet (0.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> or a very-low-protein diet (0.28 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> with a keto acid-amino acid supplement in those with GFR between 13 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;on <span class=\"nowrap\">death/end-stage</span> renal disease (ESRD) outcome. While there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups during the trial, a longer-term, postintervention, observational follow-up showed a higher risk of death in those assigned to the very-low-protein group (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.15-3.20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>An important limitation of the observations at 12 years is that measurements of protein intake or nutritional measurements were not performed beyond nine months after the original MDRD study ended; the number of patients that continued the prescribed diet is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Despite this limitation, these observations suggest that important long-term safety risks are associated with the very-low-protein diet among patients with advanced CKD.</p><p>Patients with CKD who are on a protein-restricted diet should be carefully monitored, with close follow-up every three to six months for adequate caloric intake and evidence of protein malnutrition.

However, the association between salt intake and the risk of ESRD disappeared after adjustment for changes in proteinuria, suggesting that, in CKD patients treated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the increase in proteinuria is a primary mechanism by which high-sodium intake accelerates the progression of CKD toward ESRD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small, randomized, double-blind, crossover study that included 20 CKD patients with eGFR 15 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, sodium restriction (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> or Na 1.4 to 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> compared with typical sodium intake (180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> or 4.1 to 4.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> resulted in statistically significant and clinically important reductions in BP (mean reduction of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/4</span> mmHg; 95% CI <span class=\"nowrap\">5-15/1-6</span> mmHg), extracellular fluid volume, albuminuria, and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

When salt intake is reduced, a fall in extravascular volume stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and sympathetic system. These physiologic compensatory responses are more pronounced with sudden and large reduction in salt intake but become minimal with chronic, modest salt reduction.

A modest protein restriction may slow the progression of CKD and is associated with other benefits including reduced blood urea nitrogen, uremic toxins, decreased acid load, and decreased phosphorus intake.
