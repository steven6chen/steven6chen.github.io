The rise in the plasma potassium in this disorder reflects the major role played by aldosterone in urinary potassium excretion. In addition to hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism is usually associated with a mild metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap (ie, a hyperchloremic acidosis) which has been called type 4 renal tubular acidosis.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypoaldosteronism will be presented here. The evaluation of patients with hyperkalemia in general is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232948\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical manifestations in patients with hypoaldosteronism are hyperkalemia and a mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Hypoaldosteronism should be considered in any patient with persistent hyperkalemia in whom there is no obvious cause such as renal failure or the use of potassium supplements or a potassium-sparing diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Although aldosterone also promotes sodium retention, hypoaldosteronism is <strong>not</strong> typically associated with prominent sodium wasting (except in young children) because of the compensatory action of other sodium-retaining factors (such as angiotensin II and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hyponatremia is also uncommon in patients with isolated aldosterone deficiency since there is no hypovolemia-induced stimulation of ADH release and because plasma cortisol, a tonic inhibitor of ADH release, is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When hyponatremia is present, primary adrenal insufficiency should be suspected. In this disorder, the concurrent lack of cortisol is a potent stimulus to ADH secretion, leading to water retention and a fall in the plasma sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233165\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aldosterone acts by increasing the number of open sodium channels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule, leading to increased sodium reabsorption. The ensuing removal of sodium from the tubular fluid makes the lumen electronegative, thereby creating an electrical gradient that favors the secretion of cellular potassium into the lumen through potassium channels in the luminal membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Most patients with hypoaldosteronism have only a moderate decrease in aldosterone release or effect, with a small increase in plasma potassium concentration. The development of overt hyperkalemia is most common in aldosterone deficient patients with other risk factors that further impair the efficiency of potassium excretion, such as renal insufficiency, reduced renal perfusion, or the use of medications that interfere with potassium handling such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or renin inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233172\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemia in hypoaldosteronism is usually associated with a mild metabolic acidosis; the anion gap is typically normal (ie, a hyperchloremic acidosis) unless there is concurrent renal insufficiency. This condition has been called type 4 renal tubular acidosis and appears to be due primarily to decreased urinary ammonium excretion.</p><p>Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain decreased ammonium excretion in this disorder: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When urinary potassium excretion is impaired, some of the excess potassium enters the cells, with electroneutrality being maintained in part by the movement of cellular sodium and hydrogen ions into the extracellular fluid. The ensuing intracellular alkalosis in the kidney would then diminish ammonium production in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ammonium is normally reabsorbed into the medullary interstitium and is then resecreted into the medullary collecting tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hyperkalemia decreases medullary cycling by inhibiting ammonium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. Potassium and ammonium compete for a common transporter in the luminal membrane which can function as a Na-K-2Cl or a Na-NH4-2Cl transporter. A review of loop transport mechanisms can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretics-and-calcium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretics and calcium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the collecting duct, the basolateral Na-K-ATPase can also function as a Na-NH4 exchanger, permitting uptake of NH4 from the interstitium and subsequent secretion into the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, potassium competes with NH4 for this exchanger, and therefore hyperkalemia impairs the capacity of the pump to carry NH4 into the cell. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of hypoaldosteronism include both acquired and, less often, inherited disorders, which can affect adrenal aldosterone synthesis or renal (and perhaps adrenal) renin release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82440 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Plasma renin activity is usually increased in those disorders in which there is diminished aldosterone action with the exception of the different forms of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.</p><p>The most common acquired causes of hypoaldosteronism are hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, pharmacologic inhibition of angiotensin II, and heparin therapy. Primary adrenal insufficiency is an infrequent cause. </p><p>In addition, the clinical features of aldosterone deficiency can be mimicked by disorders that reduce the renal response to aldosterone, the most common being pharmacological inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel in the cortical collecting tubule with potassium-sparing diuretics. The following discussion is divided according to the primary mechanism: reduced aldosterone production or aldosterone resistance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25008898\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced aldosterone production</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is characterized by both diminished renin release and an intraadrenal defect, which, in concert, result in decreased systemic and intraadrenal angiotensin II production. Reduced angiotensin II production contributes to the decline in aldosterone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The intraadrenal defect may involve the local renin-angiotensin system since there is evidence that angiotensin II produced locally within the adrenal gland may stimulate the release of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many of these patients also have diminished responsiveness to aldosterone as evidenced by the need for a higher physiologic replacement mineralocorticoid dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is most common in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency due to diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis, but can also occur with acute glomerulonephritis, and in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or calcineurin inhibitors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25009310\"><span class=\"h4\">Diabetes and renal insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low plasma renin activity is common in diabetic patients due, in part, to a defect in the conversion of the precursor prorenin to active renin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>). Volume expansion induced by diabetic and other chronic renal diseases also may play a contributory role; the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide release in these patients can suppress both the release of renin and hyperkalemia-induced secretion of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Similar hemodynamic and humoral changes occur in acute glomerulonephritis (such as postinfectious glomerulonephritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These changes can lead to hyperkalemia that responds to mineralocorticoid replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recovery of renal function within 1 to 2 weeks is associated with restoration of normal potassium balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have two effects that promote the development of hyperkalemia: they reduce renal renin secretion, which is normally mediated in part by locally produced prostaglandins; and they impair angiotensin II-induced release of aldosterone. A NSAID-induced reduction in glomerular filtration rate can also contribute to the rise in plasma potassium. The magnitude of the effect of NSAIDs on the plasma potassium was evaluated in a study of 50 hospitalized patients in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> therapy was initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The serum potassium rose by 0.5 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 34 percent and by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or more in 26 percent.

The latter effect may be mediated by reduced mineralocorticoid receptor expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Approximately 75 percent of transplant recipients who receive immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> develop hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;, section on 'Hyperkalemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar considerations apply to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors, which diminish aldosterone release by impairing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II both systemically and perhaps within the adrenal zona glomerulosa, by blocking angiotensin II action at the receptor, and by inhibiting renin activity, respectively. In addition, the normal stimulatory effect of an elevation in the plasma potassium concentration on aldosterone release may be mediated in part by the adrenal generation of angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, an ACE inhibitor may decrease both angiotensin II- and potassium-mediated aldosterone release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/7,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18</a>].</p><p>Unlike some of the other drugs discussed in this section, renin secretion is increased with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors usually raise the plasma potassium concentration by less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in patients with relatively normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, more prominent hyperkalemia can occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those taking a potassium-sparing diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similar considerations apply to patients treated with ARBs. The hyperkalemic effect can also be seen in patients on maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Even low-dose heparin (5000 units administered subcutaneously twice daily) can lead to a substantial reduction in plasma aldosterone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It has been estimated that a greater than normal plasma potassium concentration occurs in 7 percent of patients. Severe hyperkalemia occurs only if some other impairment in potassium excretion is present, such as renal insufficiency, or use of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or a potassium-sparing diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>It appears that low-molecular-weight heparin has a similar effect on potassium balance.

The usual defect in this disorder is in the activity of the terminal enzyme in the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway, aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Two types of aldosterone synthase defects can occur, reflecting its two enzymatic functions: CYP11B2 type I, characterized by impaired hydroxylation of corticosterone at the 18-carbon position; and CYP11B2 type II, characterized by impaired conversion of the 18-hydroxyl group to an aldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Aldosterone synthase type I deficiency would be expected to produce low plasma concentrations of products derived from corticosterone (18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone) and low urinary excretion of their metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; in contrast, aldosterone synthase type II deficiency should be associated with hypoaldosteronism but high plasma concentrations of 18-hydroxycorticosterone and increased urinary excretion of the major metabolite of 18-hydroxycorticosterone, tetrahydro-18-hydroxy,11-dehydrocorticosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

In addition to hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism is usually associated with a mild metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap (ie, a hyperchloremic acidosis). This condition has been called type 4 renal tubular acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H232948\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldosterone acts by increasing the number of open sodium channels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule, leading to increased sodium reabsorption. The ensuing removal of sodium from the tubular fluid makes the lumen electronegative, thereby creating an electrical gradient that favors the secretion of cellular potassium into the lumen through potassium channels in the luminal membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>). Decreased aldosterone effect leads to retention of potassium. (See <a href=\"#H233165\" class=\"local\">'Hyperkalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type 4 renal tubular acidosis appears to be due primarily to a hyperkalemia-induced decreased urinary ammonium excretion. (See <a href=\"#H233172\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of hypoaldosteronism include both disorders that can reduce aldosterone synthesis, and the syndrome can be mimicked by disorders that impair the renal response to aldosterone (aldosterone resistance) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82440 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major causes of impaired aldosterone production include hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, pharmacologic inhibition of renin or angiotensin II, heparin therapy, and primary adrenal insufficiency (see <a href=\"#H25008898\" class=\"local\">'Reduced aldosterone production'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is most common in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency due to diabetic nephropathy or chronic interstitial nephritis, but can also occur with acute glomerulonephritis, and in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or calcineurin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors diminish aldosterone release by impairing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II both systemically and perhaps within the adrenal zona glomerulosa, by blocking angiotensin II action at the receptor, and by inhibiting renin activity, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heparin therapy, which has a direct toxic effect on the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, can lead to a substantial reduction in plasma aldosterone concentrations.

(See <a href=\"#H147617694\" class=\"local\">'Primary adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited disorders, which are less common, include congenital isolated hypoaldosteronism and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (Gordon's syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H25009618\" class=\"local\">'Inherited disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major cause of aldosterone resistance is pharmacologic inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel in the collecting tubule, due either to potassium-sparing diuretics or antibiotics (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a>). Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to the actions of aldosterone.

The different causes of hypoaldosteronism can be differentiated by measurement of plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, and serum cortisol. These tests should be performed after the administration of a loop diuretic or three hours in the upright position, which will increase renin and aldosterone release in normal individuals.
