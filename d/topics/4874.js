In general, the technique involves removal of bone tissue (skull) and incision of the restrictive dura mater covering the brain, allowing swollen brain tissue to herniate upwards through the surgical defect rather than downwards to compress the brainstem.</p><p>Hemicraniectomy has been used to treat brain swelling and mass effect secondary to a middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction, hemispheric encephalitis, and large parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage in subarachnoid hemorrhage. The procedure was first described in 1905 by Harvey Cushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and was first utilized specifically for massive cerebral infarction in 1956 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review both the clinical features of malignant (also called massive) MCA territory infarction, and the treatment of this devastating type of stroke with decompressive hemicraniectomy. The acute treatment of large MCA infarction in the first few hours after stroke onset (prior to the development of malignant brain swelling) is similar to other types of acute ischemic stroke, as discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF MALIGNANT HEMISPHERIC INFARCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Roughly 10 percent of ischemic strokes are classified as malignant or massive because of the presence of space-occupying cerebral edema that is severe enough to produce elevated intracranial pressure and brain herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The etiology of the majority of these infarcts is cardioembolic or thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery or the proximal segment (stem, or M1) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).</p><p>On examination, patients with a malignant MCA territory infarction have forced gaze deviation, visual field deficit, hemiplegia, and aphasia or neglect, depending on the hemisphere involved. This combination of neurologic findings yields a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &gt;15 for a right hemisphere infarction and &gt;20 for a left hemisphere infarction.</p><p>Patients with this syndrome have a mortality rate as high as 78 percent due to herniation of the temporal lobe onto the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This reported mortality rate may be higher than the true rate, however, as many patients are removed from ventilatory support because of the expected poor quality of life were they to survive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60389646\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of space-occupying cerebral edema due to large infarction leads to neurologic deterioration with signs that typically include decreased arousal, pupillary changes, and worsening of motor responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These neurologic signs are indicators of the need to intervene urgently with measures to treat brain swelling, including hemicraniectomy for patients who want aggressive interventions.</p><p>The early development of decreased consciousness in patients with malignant hemispheric infarction who are awake at initial presentation is predictive of poor outcome. Supporting evidence comes from an analysis of prospective data from a randomized trial that included 564 placebo-treated patients with major anterior circulation ischemic stroke who did not have impairment in level of consciousness at baseline; the trial enrolled patients up to six hours after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Decreased level of consciousness at 3 hours after enrollment and maximum score on a level of consciousness scale (indicating no reaction to pain) in the first 24 hours were both significantly associated with increased mortality.</p><p>In a prospective study of 140 patients with occlusion of the MCA diagnosed by MRA within six hours of stroke onset, malignant MCA infarction developed in 27 (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The severity of neurologic deficit on admission as measured by the NIHSS score was an independent predictor for the development of malignant MCA infarction (per point, odds ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38). However, an NIHSS score &gt;18 predicted the development of malignant MCA infarction with only low to moderate sensitivity and specificity (70 and 63 percent).</p><p>In retrospective case-control studies, the following clinical parameters were independent predictors of malignant edema after a large MCA territory infarction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> within 24 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure &ge;180 mmHg after 12 hours from onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated white blood cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p>Hypertension and heart failure may predispose patients to poor cerebral autoregulation and inadequate collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is important as the volume of infarct distal to an occluded artery is related to the collateral supply of that territory. Elevated white blood cell counts may represent a stress response to a large infarct, or they may be associated with fever that has itself been shown to lead to worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Predictors for malignant MCA territory infarction were also evaluated in an autopsy series of 192 patients with nonlacunar infarction involving the MCA territory that included 45 patients with malignant MCA infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The following characteristics were independently and positively associated with malignant MCA infarction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No history of stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal ipsilateral circle of Willis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid occlusion</p><p/><p>The association of malignant MCA territory infarction with younger age has been suggested by other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,15</a>], and may be based upon a protective effect afforded by cerebral atrophy in older patients that accommodates brain swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Furthermore, extracranial and intracranial carotid occlusion as well as poor collateral circulation (eg, due to an incomplete ipsilateral circle of Willis) are plausible factors contributing to malignant infarction. However, it is unclear why female sex might predispose to malignant MCA territory infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head CT is the most widely available neuroimaging study in acute stroke, and the detection of a large area of early ischemic change in the MCA territory on CT is useful for predicting the subsequent development of malignant brain swelling. However, because CT findings consistent with infarction may lag behind physiologic tissue infarction, other radiographic methods that are more sensitive to evolving infarction and edema may offer greater utility in predicting patients at risk of herniation. These methods include perfusion CT, diffusion and perfusion MRI, and several techniques that measure cerebral blood flow, including positron emission tomography (PET), xenon CT, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, PET, xenon CT, and SPECT are not widely available in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large areas of hypodensity (defined as &gt;50 percent of the MCA territory) on early head CT after ischemic stroke may be predictive of fatal brain swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The best evidence supporting this comes from two retrospective case-control studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 22 patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke who had progressive neurologic deterioration leading to coma and death were compared with 104 controls who had anterior circulation ischemic stroke of comparable clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Head CT was obtained after stroke onset in cases and controls at a median time of 187 and 153 minutes, respectively. The only independent radiologic predictor of fatal brain swelling was involvement of &gt;50 percent of the MCA territory on head CT (odds ratio [OR] 6.1; 95% CI 2.3-16.6).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent multicenter study, 94 patients with large MCA territory ischemic stroke and fatal brain swelling were compared with 107 controls who had correspondingly large strokes and survived hospitalization or died of non-neurologic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hypodensity involving &gt;50 percent of the MCA territory on early head CT (performed at a median of 156 minutes) was an independent predictor of fatal brain edema (OR 6.3; 95% CI 3.5-11.6), as was involvement of additional vascular territories on head CT (OR 3.34; 95% CI 1.19-9.38).</p><p/><p>Radiologic features associated with fatal outcome were also studied in a series of 135 patients with large MCA territory infarction who had follow-up head CT scans performed within 48 hours of stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Predictors of death within 30 days included midline shift &gt;5 mm of the septum pellucidum (OR 10.9, 95% CI 3.2-37.6) and infarction of vascular territories beyond the MCA (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6-15.0).</p><p>Despite this evidence, other data suggest that routine head CT has limited utility in predicting outcome. This point is supported by findings from a series of 34 patients with infarction of &gt;50 percent of MCA territory on early (&lt;12 hours) CT scan; only 17 patients (50 percent) developed a malignant course with massive swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Several reports have found that perfusion CT can be used to predict malignant MCA infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. As an example, one study used perfusion CT to calculate infarct volume and routine CT to calculate intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, a measure of intracranial volume reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The ratio of infarct volume to CSF volume was a better predictor of a malignant course than other measures such as ischemic lesion volume or clinical characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to head CT, a large volume of infarction, as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, may predict a malignant course in MCA territory stroke that is characterized by cerebral edema.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational cohort of 140 patients with occlusion of the MCA diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) within six hours of stroke onset, malignant MCA infarction developed in 27 (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Independent radiologic predictors for the development of malignant MCA infarction included lesion size on DWI (per 1 mL odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) and combined occlusion of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries (OR 5.38, 95% CI 1.55-18.68). A DWI lesion volume of &gt;82 mL predicted the development of malignant MCA infarction with a high specificity (98 percent). However, the sensitivity of this cutoff was low (52 percent) due to the development of malignant MCA infarction in 14 patients with DWI lesions &lt;82 mL, including 10 patients with DWI lesion volumes &lt;50 mL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 28 patients with an MCA territory infarction diagnosed by DWI and MCA or carotid T occlusion by MRA performed within 14 hours after onset (mean 6.5 hours), a DWI infarct volume &gt;145 mL was predictive of herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebral blood flow studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantifying cerebral blood flow with CT angiography (CTA), xenon CT, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography (PET) may be predictive of cerebral swelling in patients with malignant MCA territory infarction. </p><p>Collateral blood flow can be graded from CTA measures using a four-point Collateral Score (CS) as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 = absent collateral supply to the occluded MCA territory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 = collateral supply filling &le;50 percent of the occluded MCA territory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 = collateral supply filling &gt;50 percent but &lt;100 percent of the occluded MCA territory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 = the collateral supply of the occluded MCA territory is the same or greater than the normal contralateral hemisphere</p><p/><p>The potential utility of assessing collateral flow on CTA to predict the development of severe brain edema is illustrated by a retrospective analysis of 64 patients with MCA infarction by diffusion MRI and confirmed occlusion of the MCA trunk on CTA who were diagnosed within eight hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Independent predictors of massive brain edema on multivariable analysis were an NIHSS score &gt;18 (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.2-16.0) and poor collaterals as denoted by a CS &lt;2 (OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.7-30.3). Another study also found that poor collateral circulation on baseline CTA was an independent predictor of malignant MCA infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In another retrospective study, 20 patients with aggressively managed acute MCA territory strokes had measurements of CBF by Xenon CT scanning within six hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A mean blood flow to the affected hemisphere of &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/100</span> g per minute was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of severe edema or herniation. Xenon CT may also hold promise for approximating the volume of infarcted tissue, as blood flow values near 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/100</span> g per minute likely represent infarction.</p><p>SPECT and PET studies have also been evaluated as predictors of herniation, although the reports have been relatively small. One study found that the sensitivity of SPECT for fatal cerebral edema was much higher than CT (82 percent versus 36 percent), while the specificity was similar (98 percent versus 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The main goal of hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA territory infarction is to prevent further brain injury by reversing mass effect, reducing brain tissue shifts, decreasing intracranial pressure, and improving cerebral perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There is evidence from a number of small randomized controlled trials that hemicraniectomy for malignant hemispheric infarction reduces mortality. However, the ultimate neurologic outcome is often less than optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], as many surviving patients are left with moderate or severe disability (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Randomized trials'</a> below). Functional status in most studies is assessed using disability scales such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) or Barthel Index that do not fully account for poor cognitive outcomes, which may be nonetheless extremely disabling.</p><p>Patients who develop malignant MCA territory infarction should be enrolled in randomized controlled trials of decompressive hemicraniectomy if this option is available. In the absence of trial availability, and given the dire prognosis associated with medical treatment, we suggest decompressive hemicraniectomy within 48 hours of stroke onset for patients age &le;60 years with an indisputable diagnosis of malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction (with &gt;50 percent infarction of MCA territory by head CT) who are at high risk of developing malignant edema and who desire aggressive therapy. This surgery may also be offered on a case-by-case basis for otherwise healthy patients older than 60 years of age and beyond 48 hours after stroke onset.</p><p>Patient age and timing of surgery may be important variables when considering treatment with hemicraniectomy. In addition, younger patients (60 years or less) may have better functional outcome and decreased mortality than older patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Hemicraniectomy is clearly aggressive therapy and may not be appropriate for many patients and families. Alternative treatment options for malignant MCA territory infarction include medical management of increased intracranial pressure for those who desire aggressive treatment, and supportive medical care or withdrawal of medical care for those who do not desire aggressive therapies. Hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA territory infarction is not widely practiced, nor does it constitute standard-of-care.</p><p>Standard medical therapy for large hemispheric infarctions involves management of intracerebral pressure, with measures such as positioning of the patient, osmotic therapy, and hyperventilation as needed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>); blood pressure, temperature, and glycemic management; close monitoring for neurological complications, such as depressed mental status, herniation, and seizures; and prevention of secondary complications such as aspiration and deep venous thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Randomized trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from several small randomized controlled trials demonstrates that decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) for massive middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction increases survival, compared with standard medical therapy, but most patients who survive are left with moderately severe to severe disability (ie, a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75411 \">table 1</a>) score of 4 or 5).

Additionally, patients may recover significantly from aphasia, especially those who are younger.</p><p>There is limited observational evidence that decompressive hemicraniectomy for dominant hemisphere infarction may lead to improvement in language function. Support for this notion comes from a study that followed 14 patients with left MCA territory infarction who had surgical decompression; a significant improvement in different aspects of aphasia was observed in 13 patients (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/decompressive-hemicraniectomy-for-malignant-middle-cerebral-artery-territory-infarction/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>It is important to realize that nondominant hemisphere strokes can lead to severe and disabling deficits related to behavioral change, depression, abulia, inattention, or neglect.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and description'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Roughly 10 percent of ischemic strokes are classified as malignant due to cerebral edema. Clinical features of the malignant hemispheric infarction may include forced gaze deviation, visual field deficit, hemiplegia, and aphasia or neglect, depending on the hemisphere involved. The mortality is as high as 78 percent due to herniation of the temporal lobe on to the brainstem. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of malignant hemispheric infarction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypodensity on head CT involving &gt;50 percent of the MCA territory may be more likely to develop signs of herniation. Additional CT findings that may be predictive of malignant edema include midline shift of the septum pellucidum &gt;5 mm and infarction of additional vascular territories. Similarly, a large volume of infarction on MRI as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging may predict development of malignant course in MCA territory stroke. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic predictors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical parameters that may predict malignant edema after a large MCA territory infarction include severity of neurologic deficit at presentation, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> within 24 hours of symptom onset, a systolic blood pressure &ge;180 mmHg after 12 hours from onset, a history of hypertension, a history of heart failure, and an elevated white blood cell count. Young age, first-ever stroke, carotid occlusion, and poor collateral circulation may also predispose to malignant MCA territory stroke. Early decline in level of consciousness in patients awake at presentation is another clinical feature predictive of poor outcome. (See <a href=\"#H60389646\" class=\"local\">'Clinical predictors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from small randomized controlled trials show that hemicraniectomy for malignant hemispheric infarction reduces mortality. However, the ultimate neurologic outcome is less than optimal (moderate or severe disability) in many cases. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Randomized trials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age and timing of surgery may be important variables in considering this procedure. Laboratory evidence suggests that early surgery is more likely to be beneficial, although clinical trials have not yet borne this out. Younger patients (age &le;60 years) may have better functional outcome and lower mortality than older patients. The limited evidence from randomized trials suggests that patients aged 60 to 80 years may also benefit from decompression in terms of lower mortality. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hemicraniectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients age 60 years or younger with malignant infarction involving &gt;50 percent of the MCA territory associated with a decreased level of consciousness, who are thus at high risk of developing malignant edema, we suggest decompressive hemicraniectomy if surgery can be initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Hemicraniectomy should proceed only after a thorough discussion with the patient (if cognizant) and the family; they should understand that hemicraniectomy increases the odds of survival, and probably increases the chance of surviving with only moderate disability, but most patients who survive are left with severe to very severe disability. The alternative treatment of aggressive medical therapy for malignant edema may be equally reasonable. For otherwise healthy patients who are older than age 60 years or within 48 to 96 hours after stroke onset, decompressive hemicraniectomy remains an option on a case-by-case basis.
