In many cases, these manifestations appear to be directly related to the presence of the virus.</p><p>The extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations of acute and chronic hepatitis due to HCV as well as the treatment of HCV are discussed separately.

The most common extrahepatic findings with which the relationship to HCV infection is more strongly established are cryoglobulinemia, autoimmune disorders (including autoantibodies and sicca syndrome), porphyria cutanea tarda, and lichen planus. There also appears to be a clear association with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (particularly in patients with underlying cryoglobulinemia), but the incidence of lymphoma among HCV-infected patients overall remains low. </p><p>Evidence is also mounting that HCV is linked to diabetes mellitus, although the extent to which HCV infection itself rather than shared risk factors or comorbidities contribute to the association is unknown. Furthermore, because diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular disease (with which HCV has been associated in some studies) are common and multifactorial, it is difficult to determine whether HCV is a major contributing factor in an individual patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2164271198\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the extrahepatic manifestations of HCV is important to inform testing for HCV with certain findings and to guide screening or monitoring for extrahepatic disease in HCV-infected individuals. Because of the associations, we advise testing for HCV infection in patients with the following manifestations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryoglobulinemia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Porphyria cutanea tarda </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lichen planus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrolytic acral erythema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained arthritis or false positive rheumatoid factor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sj&ouml;gren <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/sicca</span> syndrome </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura </p><p/><p>Diagnostic testing for HCV infection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H692855539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and testing approach'</a>.)</p><p>Conversely, extrahepatic manifestations can occur at any time during chronic infection with HCV, so patients diagnosed with chronic HCV infection should have evaluation for such manifestations at the initial visit and routinely during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. History of an HCV-infected patient should cover rheumatologic symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias,</span> dry eyes or mouth) and the physical exam should include a skin exam to evaluate for findings of cryoglobulinemia (eg, palpable purpura), porphyria cutanea tarda, and other associated dermatologic features. Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, an assessment of renal function, evaluation for proteinuria and hematuria, and thyroid function testing. Cryoglobulins and complement levels should be checked if there is evidence of renal disease or other compatible clinical findings. Workup for specific complaints, such as join pain or sicca symptoms, should include evaluation for associated syndromes as outlined below. Diagnosis of specific syndromes are discussed in the dedicated topic review. </p><p>Given the high efficacy and tolerability of interferon-free direct-acting antiviral therapies and the reductions in mortality and morbidity with successful eradication of HCV, treatment with such regimens is indicated for all chronically infected HCV-infected patients, with the exception of for those with limited life expectancy (eg, &lt;12 months) due to unrelated conditions who would be unlikely to benefit from such treatment. The presence of extrahepatic manifestations, particularly those that are severe or highly symptomatic, is a reason to initiate antiviral treatment sooner than otherwise intended, as many extrahepatic findings improve or resolve with successful treatment of HCV infection. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematologic disorders that have been associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) include essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathies (which may be associated with multiple myeloma), and lymphoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, also called type II cryoglobulinemia, is a lymphoproliferative disorder that can lead to the deposition of circulating immune complexes in small- to medium-sized blood vessels. More than 90 percent of patients with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia are infected with HCV, and about half of patients with HCV have cryoglobulins (69 of 127 in one study) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80075 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a result, all patients with chronic HCV should be evaluated for cryoglobulinemia. If either the history or the physical examination is suggestive of possible cryoglobulinemia, then the patient should undergo appropriate testing. All patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia should be tested for HCV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;, section on 'HCV infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.).</p><p>The most common clinical manifestations include leukocytoclastic vasculitis (with palpable purpura and petechiae), arthralgias, renal disease (usually a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis), neurologic disease, and hypocomplementemia. The purpura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697 \">picture 1</a>) often involves the lower legs, may come in &quot;crops,&quot; and can leave brown spots on the skin after it resolves. Skin biopsy demonstrates cutaneous vasculitis with dermal blood vessel destruction associated with a neutrophilic infiltration in and around the vessel wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52548%7ERHEUM%2F66296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52548 graphicRef66296 \">image 1A-B</a>).

Other tissues, particularly the lower extremity peripheral nerves, may show similar vasculitic changes involving the vasa nervorum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This may manifest clinically as a peripheral neuropathy that, as in other forms of vasculitis, is typically asymmetric (also called a mononeuritis multiplex). Lymphoma is an uncommon manifestation of cryoglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;, section on 'Mononeuritis multiplex'</a> and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment of HCV can result in decreased cryoglobulin levels and improvements in skin lesions, renal function parameters, and other symptoms. As a result, prompt antiviral treatment should be considered in patients with symptoms related to cryoglobulinemia. Some patients with severe complications of cryoglobulinemia require additional therapy, such as plasmapheresis.</p><p>However, not all patients with HCV infection and cryoglobulinemia respond to anti-HCV therapy, and a reduction in cryoglobulin titers may not be directly associated with a decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase or HCV RNA levels. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-infection-in-adults-with-renal-impairment#H1907695881\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in adults with renal impairment&quot;, section on 'Rationale for antiviral treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCV infection has been associated with the development of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, and extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) as well as primary hepatic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-19</a>]. The association between HCV and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is relatively well established, with a higher prevalence of HCV infection among lymphoma patients and vice versa, some evidence suggesting a decreased risk of lymphoma following treatment of HCV infection, and rare reports suggesting regression of lymphoma with antiviral treatment. The risk of lymphoma may be linked to cryoglobulinemia; the development of unexplained anemia or lymphadenopathy in a patient with HCV infection and clinically active cryoglobulinemia should raise concern about an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Because of this association, it is reasonable to test patients with lymphoma for HCV infection.</p><p>Findings that support an association of HCV with lymphoma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis that included 48 studies concluded that the prevalence of HCV in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was 15 percent, much higher than the prevalence in the general population (around 1.5 percent) or in patients with other hematologic malignancies (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large cohort study of United States veterans published after the meta-analysis estimated the risk of NHL was increased by about 28 percent in patients with HCV (hazard ratio 1.28) compared with non-HCV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The risk was also increased for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and cryoglobulinemia, but not other hematologic malignancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent cohort study from Taiwan that included over 11,000 HCV-infected and 46,000 uninfected individuals found an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms and NHL (adjusted hazard ratios 2.3 and 2.0, respectively) with HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p>While not extensively studied, some data suggest that successful treatment of HCV may reduce the risk of lymphoma in patients who achieve a sustained virologic response. One of the largest studies included 3209 patients with HCV, of whom 2708 (84 percent) had received treatment with interferon-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The overall annual incidence of lymphoma in patients with HCV was estimated to be 0.2 percent. The risk was reduced significantly in the 1048 patients who had achieved a sustained virologic response compared with those who had persistent infection (hazard ratio 0.13). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data also suggest the possibility of beneficial effects on the natural history of lymphoma with antiviral treatment. In one case report, remission of follicular lymphoma occurred following successful direct-acting-antiviral treatment for underlying HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Regression of splenic lymphoma has also been described in association with interferon-based HCV treatment in a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=splenic-marginal-zone-lymphoma#H2288156377\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Splenic marginal zone lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Antiviral therapy for hepatitis C'</a>.)</p><p>Lymphoma may develop due to the progression of cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. One hypothesis is that cryoglobulinemia arises from chronic stimulation of the immune system by HCV, predisposing to a lymphoproliferative disorder. While the steps leading to the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder are uncertain, an increased prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation in the B cells of patients with HCV may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Some HCV-associated lymphomas produce soluble immunoglobulins directed against the E2 protein (an HCV envelope glycoprotein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This observation supports the hypothesis that some HCV-associated lymphomas originate from B cells that were initially activated by the HCV-E2 protein.

In a study of 553 patients, the presence of HCV infection predicted severe hepatoxicity in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens (hazard ratio 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1116878851\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal gammopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic HCV infection may be a risk factor for the development of monoclonal gammopathies; however, the association is unclear, and monoclonal gammopathy is not rare in the general population over the age of 50 years. Prior to the development of HCV tests, the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathies was noted to be increased in patients with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Routine screening of patients with HCV for monoclonal gammopathies is not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The results of studies looking at the association of HCV with monoclonal gammopathies have been variable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of patients with chronic liver disease compared 239 HCV-positive patients with 98 HCV-negative controls (76 with chronic hepatitis B, 9 with alcoholic liver disease, and 13 with primary biliary cholangitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Monoclonal bands were more common in patients with HCV compared with age-matched controls (11 versus 1 percent). Of the 26 patients with monoclonal bands, 9 (35 percent) had either smoldering myeloma or multiple myeloma. The incidence of monoclonal gammopathies peaked in patients between the ages of 60 and 69 years (21 percent). Of the patients with monoclonal gammopathies, 50 percent had HCV genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">2a/c,</span> which was significantly higher than the prevalence in the matched controls (18 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study of 824 patients with chronic liver disease (530 with HCV and 294 with other liver diseases) found that 12 percent of the HCV-positive patients had a monoclonal band, compared with 3 percent of the control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Like the earlier study, this study also showed an increase in the prevalence of HCV genotype 2a among patients with monoclonal gammopathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, other studies have failed to show an association of monoclonal gammopathies with HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. For example, one study of 100 patients with HCV found no cases of monoclonal gammopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to monoclonal gammopathies, HCV has also been associated with polyclonal or oligoclonal hyperglobulinemia (most often IgG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In these patients, gammaglobulin levels correlate with the disease severity seen on liver biopsy.

PCT has both sporadic and inherited (autosomal dominant) forms that are indistinguishable clinically. A strong association between the sporadic form of PCT and HCV infection has been demonstrated in multiple studies. As an example, a systematic review of 50 studies that included a total of 2167 patients with PCT found an overall prevalence of HCV of 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, there was marked geographic variability; lowest prevalence rates (20 to 30 percent) were observed in reports from Australia, the Czech Republic, and France, while the highest rates (71 to 85 percent) were observed in Japan, Italy, and Spain. The prevalence in North America was 66 percent. A central factor in the geographic variability appeared to be the baseline rates of HCV infection in the general population.

Skin disease is characterized by photosensitivity and skin fragility, with which exposure to the sun <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minor trauma can lead to skin erythema and the development of vesicles and bullae that may become hemorrhagic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74528 \">picture 2</a>). Hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, hirsutism, and sclerodermatous changes may develop with the passage of time. Chronic liver disease is common in sporadic PCT.

Environmental triggers are thought to be necessary to provoke an attack of PCT. Possible triggers of PCT include polyhalogenated hydrocarbons (such as hexachlorobenzene), alcohol, estrogens, and iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>].

The diagnosis can also be made directly by measuring hepatic UROD activity (if available). All patients with PCT should be tested for HCV infection, as well as other potential disease associations, including HIV infection, iron overload, and hemochromatosis (with HFE mutation testing).

Thus, our approach to patients who have not achieved SVR or who are not eligible for standard antiviral therapy has been to treat them with a maintenance dose of peginterferon, provided it is tolerated, in the hope to achieve suppression of HCV RNA and thereby control the PCT.

In many cases, these manifestations appear to be directly related to the presence of the virus, although a direct link is often difficult to establish. Because of the potential association, patients with the following syndromes should undergo testing for HCV infection (see <a href=\"#H2570756911\" class=\"local\">'Strength of disease associations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2164271198\" class=\"local\">'Clinical implications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cryoglobulinemia </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Porphyria cutanea tarda </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lichen planus </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Necrolytic acral erythema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unexplained arthritis or false positive rheumatoid factor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sj&ouml;gren <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/sicca</span> symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura compare</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History and physical exam of HCV-infected patients should include assessment for common extrahepatic manifestations, including rheumatologic symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/arthralgias,</span> dry eyes or mouth), cryoglobulinemia (eg, palpable purpura), porphyria cutanea tarda, and other dermatologic abnormalities. Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, an assessment of renal function, evaluation for proteinuria and hematuria, and thyroid function testing. Cryoglobulins and complement levels should be checked if there is evidence of renal disease or other compatible clinical findings of cryoglobulinemia. Testing for other extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection should be guided by symptoms or specific physical findings. (See <a href=\"#H2164271198\" class=\"local\">'Clinical implications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common or most strongly associated extrahepatic manifestations of HCV include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia &ndash; More than 90 percent of patients with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia are infected with HCV, and about half of patients with HCV have cryoglobulins. The most common clinical manifestations include leukocytoclastic vasculitis (with palpable purpura and petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78697 \">picture 1</a>)), arthralgias, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, neurologic disease, and hypocomplementemia. Treatment of HCV can result in decreased cryoglobulin levels and improvements in skin lesions, renal function parameters, and other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B-cell non-Hodgkin and primary hepatic lymphomas &ndash; The association between HCV and these lymphomas is relatively well established, with a higher prevalence of HCV infection among lymphoma patients and vice versa, some evidence suggesting a decreased risk of lymphoma following treatment of HCV infection, and rare reports suggesting regression of lymphoma with antiviral treatment. The risk of lymphoma may be linked to cryoglobulinemia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) &ndash; About half of patients with the sporadic form of PCT have evidence of HCV infection, although with marked geographic variability in prevalence. Skin disease is characterized by photosensitivity and skin fragility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74528 \">picture 2</a>). PCT often, but not always, improves with clearance of HCV viremia. (See <a href=\"#H1373881246\" class=\"local\">'Porphyria cutanea tarda'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other dermatologic manifestations &ndash; Lichen planus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50632 \">picture 3</a>) and necrolytic acral erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F111239\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111239 \">picture 4</a>) are strongly associated with HCV infection. (See <a href=\"#H393323661\" class=\"local\">'Lichen planus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1676140917\" class=\"local\">'Necrolytic acral erythema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autoimmune disorders &ndash; Subclinical autoantibody formation, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome with sicca symptoms, thyroid disease, and autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura have all been associated with chronic HCV infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV infection has been linked to the development of diabetes mellitus, with a nearly 70 percent increased relative risk among HCV-infected individuals. Limited evidence suggests that successful HCV treatment decreases the risk of diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"#H5757471\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of other extrahepatic manifestations potentially associated with HCV have been described, including ocular diseases, other renal diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular disease, and neurocognitive dysfunction.
