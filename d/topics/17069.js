Regular assessment of growth is an essential part of pediatric practice and includes comparison of a child's growth pattern to established norms. When determining the normality of a child's growth pattern, serial measurements of height and calculation of height velocity (HV) is more useful than a single height-for-age percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In interpreting a child's HV, allowance must be made for age, pubertal development, and other factors. </p><p>The causes, diagnosis, and treatment of children with abnormally rapid growth and tall stature will be reviewed here.

This process is regulated by many systems, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine mechanisms &ndash; Growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), androgens, and thyroid hormone all stimulate chondrogenesis, while glucocorticoids inhibit chondrogenesis. Estrogens promote linear growth by stimulating GH and IGF-I secretion, but also accelerate chondrocyte senescence, leading to fusion of the growth plates and cessation of linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, estrogen deficiency or insensitivity (eg, caused by mutations in the estrogen receptor and aromatase genes), inhibits closure of the epiphyses, thus causing continued linear growth and tall stature. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Sex hormone deficiency or insensitivity'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proinflammatory cytokines &ndash; Some cytokines negatively regulate growth plate function.

These include gain of function mutations in <em>NPR2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] and loss-of-function mutations in <em>FGFR3</em> that cause a syndrome characterized by camptodactyly, tall stature, and hearing loss (CATSHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, mutations that lead to alterations in epigenetic regulation are noted as the causes of Sotos syndrome, Weaver syndrome, and <em>DNMT3A</em> overgrowth syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Marfan syndrome is caused by certain mutations in <em>FBN1</em>, whereas other mutations in <em>FBN1</em> cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome, which includes short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Size at birth is determined more by maternal nutrition and intrauterine and placental factors than by genetics; the genetic factors that influence growth are not fully expressed during fetal growth. As a result, the correlation coefficient between birth length and adult height is only 0.25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>During the first two years of life (infantile phase), linear growth initially is very rapid and gradually decelerates. Overall growth during this period is about 30 to 35 cm. During this period, an infant's height curve often crosses percentile lines as the growth moves away from the influences of the intrauterine environment and toward the child's genetic potential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;, section on 'Linear growth'</a>.)</p><p>The childhood phase of growth (ages two years to puberty) is characterized by a relatively constant height velocity (HV).

During puberty, peak HV is 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in girls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96366\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96366 \">figure 1A</a>) and 5 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96367 \">figure 1B</a>). The timing of peak HV depends upon gender and the timing of puberty. Girls have their peak HV during early puberty (Tanner stages II to III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The pubertal growth spurt for girls typically starts around age 10 but may start as early as age 8 for those who mature early. Boys reach their peak HV during mid-puberty (Tanner stages III to IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The pubertal growth spurt for boys typically starts around age 12 but may start as early as age 10 for those who mature early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The rate of growth typically peaks about 18 months later. After the pubertal growth spurt, HV diminishes over the next few years toward zero as the epiphyses of the long bones fuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Referrals for tall boys who are otherwise normal are very rare. Referrals for tall girls were common in the past but are now infrequent because of the increased social acceptance of tall girls and tall women in many societies. </p><p>Most children who grow excessively are part of a continuum of a normal distribution curve, and only a minority will have a defined abnormality of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nevertheless, it is important to identify children in whom tall stature or an accelerated growth rate is a symptom of an underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94942 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Evaluation of a child suspected of having tall stature is guided by answering the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's height abnormal for the population?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's growth abnormally rapid?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's growth within the range for the family?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there evidence of accelerated growth? </p><p/><p>The answers to these questions guide a focused history and physical examination, and in some cases laboratory evaluation, to determine the cause and appropriate management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372147863\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the child's height abnormal for the population?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal growth is defined by the variance of growth within the reference population. The normal range usually is defined as length or height within 2 standard deviations (SD) from the population mean (z-score between -2 and +2). This threshold is equivalent to a height between the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile and 97.7<sup>th</sup> percentile. </p><p>Tall stature is typically defined as length or height &ge;97.7<sup>th</sup> percentile (z-score &ge;2) compared with the reference population. Less stringent definitions use length or height &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile (z-score &ge;1.66). Height percentiles and z-scores can be determined by plotting on a height-for-age chart, or calculated using a calculator for recumbent length (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-who-infant-length-for-age-percentiles-less-than24-months\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), or standing height for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H31542395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Recommended growth charts'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372147954\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the child&rsquo;s growth abnormally rapid?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second step in evaluating tall stature is determination of the child's growth rate or height velocity (HV). This requires serial measurements of height. Growth can be considered unusually rapid if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The height-for-age curve has deviated upward across two major height percentile curves (eg, from below the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile to above the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile) in children between two years of age and the onset of puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63399%7EPEDS%2F77249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63399 graphicRef77249 \">figure 2A-B</a>). This pattern of growth reflects rapid height velocity, even if the patient has not developed tall stature. During the peripubertal period, height percentiles often increase for children who begin their pubertal growth spurt early then return to previous channels before their peers do the same. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Or, if the child is growing more rapidly than the following rates (which represent the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile for HV): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age two to four years: HV more than 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age four to six years: HV more than 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&gt;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age six years to puberty:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV more than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for boys (&gt;2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV more than 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for girls (&gt;2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a more precise assessment of linear growth, the child's HV can be plotted on an HV chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96366%7EPEDS%2F96367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96366 graphicRef96367 \">figure 1A-B</a>) to determine the HV percentile for the child's age and gender. In general, an HV greater than the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile warrants a basic evaluation for tall stature, consisting of assessment of the stature and growth patterns of the child's parents and evaluation for dysmorphic features. An HV greater than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile warrants further evaluation, including bone age determination. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372149478\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the child's growth within the range for the family?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heights of the biological parents reflect the genetic component for the child's growth. A general estimate of a child's genetic height potential can be obtained by calculation of the midparental height, which is based upon the heights of both parents and adjusted for the sex of the child. Whenever possible, the parents' heights should be directly measured rather than self-reported. The calculation can be performed using a calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-prediction-of-childs-target-height-based-on-midparental-height\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>). This yields prediction of the child's adult height, sometimes called &quot;target height&quot;. For both boys and girls, 8.5 cm (3.3 inches) on either side of this calculated value represents the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 97<sup>th</sup> percentiles for predicted adult height. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;, section on 'Predicted height'</a>.) </p><p>This method is substantially less accurate than the bone-age based method described below because it does not reflect disease processes or environmental contributions to growth, which may affect skeletal maturation. (See <a href=\"#H372149722\" class=\"local\">'Bone age'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372149510\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there evidence of accelerated growth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children with abnormally rapid HV, and especially those whose anticipated adult height is tall for the family, we suggest determination of bone age. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372149722\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone age is a measure of skeletal maturity, obtained by assessing the appearance and shape of the growth plates and bones of the left hand and wrist from a radiograph; this requires expert interpretation by a radiologist or endocrinologist with experience in the technique. The results can be used to inform estimates of the child's growth potential and likely adult height in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the bone age is delayed or advanced, then the child's height percentile can be recalculated based on bone age rather than chronological age. As an example, if an eight-year-old girl is 140 cm tall and has a bone age of 10 years, this corresponds to a height at the 97<sup>th</sup> percentile for chronological age, but the 60<sup>th</sup> percentile for bone age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bone age can be used to predict the adult height, using one of several algorithms. For children with tall stature, the recommended technique is that developed by Bayley-Pinneau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], which compares the hand-wrist radiograph with the bone age atlas developed by Greulich and Pyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This technique employs a table to translate the child's bone age and chronological age to a decimal fraction of adult height (eg, 0.75). To predict adult height, the present height is divided by the fraction of adult height. Although the method is valid for children six years and older, the prediction becomes increasingly accurate with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and use of these tables in children younger than 12 years tends to overestimate adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Predicting adult height is more accurate in tall girls than in boys. For any individual, the height prediction lacks precision, as reflected by a broad 95 percent confidence interval. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H282452950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Bone age determination'</a>.) </p><p/><p>The bone age also helps to determine the differential diagnosis for the child's rapid growth. Most endocrine causes of tall stature are associated with advanced bone age, except for sex hormone deficiency or insensitivities, which are associated with delayed bone age. By contrast, familial tall stature usually is associated with normal bone age. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Statural overgrowth in infancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Statural overgrowth in childhood and adolescence'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372149817\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child's pattern of growth, medical history (including detailed family history), and physical examination are the mainstays of assessment of tall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapidly growing children. When dysmorphic features are found, special effort should be made to rule out the disorders and syndromes that are associated with excessive growth, including referral to an appropriate subspecialist, if available. Features that suggest a specific cause of overgrowth are outlined in the table and detailed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94942 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">STATURAL OVERGROWTH IN INFANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated growth occurring during fetal life and infancy has several causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of large-for-gestational age infants.

Maternal hyperglycemia leads to fetal hyperglycemia, which in turn causes fetal hyperinsulinemia. The hyperinsulinemia results in increased fetal growth, an increase in subcutaneous tissue, and enlargement of most organs, including the liver. Affected infants usually are large, more so in weight than in length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Because of hyperinsulinemia, infants of diabetic mothers should be monitored for hypoglycemia during the first hours and days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The hyperinsulinemia is transient, so this condition does not in itself cause overgrowth in infancy or childhood. However, there is an association between macrosomia at birth caused by maternal diabetes and later development of obesity.

Less stringent definitions use length or height &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile (z-score &ge;1.66). Height percentiles and z-scores can be determined by plotting on a height-for-age chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63399%7EPEDS%2F77249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63399 graphicRef77249 \">figure 2A-B</a>), or calculated using a calculator for standing height for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) or for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cdc-height-for-age-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>). Abnormally rapid growth is suggested if a child's height has deviated upward across two major height percentile curves between two years of age and the onset of puberty. (See <a href=\"#H372147863\" class=\"local\">'Is the child's height abnormal for the population?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calculation of height velocity (HV) is an important step in the assessment of a child with tall stature. HV above the following thresholds usually is abnormal and should prompt an evaluation for a growth abnormality:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age two to four years: HV more than 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age four to six years: HV more than 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (&gt;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age six years to puberty:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV more than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for boys (&gt;2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>HV more than 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> for girls (&gt;2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">inches/year)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For a more precise assessment of linear growth, the child's HV can be plotted on an HV chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96366%7EPEDS%2F96367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96366 graphicRef96367 \">figure 1A-B</a>) to determine the HV percentile for the child's age and gender; an HV greater than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile is considered abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H372147954\" class=\"local\">'Is the child&rsquo;s growth abnormally rapid?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A general estimate of a child's genetic height potential can be obtained by calculation of the midparental height, which is based upon the heights of both parents and adjusted for the sex of the child. The calculation can be performed using an equation or calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-prediction-of-childs-target-height-based-on-midparental-height\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>). A tall child whose height is within the range expected for the family is likely to have familial tall stature. (See <a href=\"#H372149478\" class=\"local\">'Is the child's growth within the range for the family?'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with abnormally rapid HV, and especially those whose projected height is tall for the family, the evaluation for tall stature should also include radiographic determination of bone age. This result is used to predict height potential. This provides a more accurate estimate of the child's adult height than the midparental height method. It also identifies delayed or accelerated skeletal growth, which may be associated with certain endocrine disorders. (See <a href=\"#H372149722\" class=\"local\">'Bone age'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial (constitutional) tall stature, a variant of the normal pattern of childhood growth and development, is defined as a condition in which the height of an individual is more than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the corresponding mean height for a normal subject of the same age and gender, in the absence of pathologic causes of tall stature. Distinguishing features are a family history of tall stature and lack of dysmorphic features, which permits distinction from pathologic causes of excessive growth. We do <strong>not</strong> recommend medical treatment for most children with familial tall stature (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) because there is little evidence of psychosocial benefits and because of possible adverse effects, including increased risks for infertility. (See <a href=\"#H69599708\" class=\"local\">'Familial tall stature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of a disorder causing rapid growth should be considered in children with abnormal HV (as defined above), or in any child with rapid growth and features suggestive of an underlying disorder, including dysmorphic features, disproportionate growth (eg, long arms or legs compared with the trunk), precocious puberty or hypogonadism, or developmental delay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94942 \">table 1</a>). Abnormal HV should be evaluated even if the child has not developed tall stature. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Causes of abnormally rapid growth during infancy include maternal diabetes mellitus, cerebral gigantism (Sotos syndrome), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Statural overgrowth in infancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endocrine causes of abnormally rapid growth during childhood and adolescence include precocious puberty (including virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia), growth hormone excess (pituitary gigantism), hyperthyroidism, and familial glucocorticoid deficiency or resistance. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Statural overgrowth in childhood and adolescence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Non-endocrine causes of abnormally rapid growth include Klinefelter syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Exogenous obesity is often associated with high-normal growth rates and relatively tall stature for age prior to puberty. However, bone age may be advanced so that adult height is not increased. A subset of patients with early onset obesity have mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and tend to have particularly tall stature as a child, which persists into adulthood.
