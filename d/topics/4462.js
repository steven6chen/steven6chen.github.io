Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) refers to variable constellations of birth defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55913 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of intrauterine rubella infection is not altered by treatment with antiviral or biologic agents. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care and surveillance are the cornerstones of management for CRI. Specific treatment depends upon the clinical manifestations, which may develop or progress over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75721\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75721 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of CRS are nonspecific (eg, hearing loss, meningoencephalitis, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, etc). They are managed in the same manner as they are in neonates, infants, and children without CRS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with CRS require close monitoring during the first 6 to 12 months of life, particularly for hearing impairment and developmental abnormalities. Other late manifestations that should be monitored over time include eye disease (cataracts, glaucoma), endocrine disease, and immune deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Long-term monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention is the most important aspect of management of CRI. Preventive measures include immunization of girls before they reach child-bearing age, testing pregnant women for rubella immunity and providing counseling regarding avoidance of exposure to rubella for those who are nonimmune, and ensuring that caregivers of children with CRS in child care and hospital settings are rubella immune. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-rubella-syndrome-management-outcome-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Reef SE, Plotkin S, Cordero JF, et al.
