In one large series, affected patients with <em>IFNGR1</em> mutations had more frequent mycobacterial disease episodes (mean of 19 per 100 person-years), more disseminated disease (mean of four organs per infection), and shorter mean disease-free intervals (mean 1.6 years) compared with patients with AD disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although infection with mycobacteria and <em>Salmonella </em>are predominantly associated with these genetic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the phenotype also includes increased susceptibility to cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, parainfluenza virus, and <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13</a>]. The typical histopathologic feature is failure to form well-circumscribed tuberculoid granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>These AR mutations in IFN-gamma-R1 or IFN-gamma-R2 that lead to complete loss of protein expression map to the extracellular domains of the receptor proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) show significantly decreased or absent cell surface expression of IFN-gamma-R1 or R2. Thus, signaling via the IFN-gamma-R is defective, which is detected via absent intracellular staining for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Detection of deleterious mutations at the molecular level confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive treatment with antimycobacterial antibiotics remains as the single accepted method for the management of patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Cytokine replacement therapy has limited efficacy among patients with AR complete defects of IFN-gamma-R1 and IFN-gamma-R2 since lack of expression of the receptors leads to a failure to respond to IFN-gamma. The group at the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical center instead administers escalating doses of IFN-alpha along with antimycobacterial chemotherapy to patients with complete IFN-gamma-R1 defect. The rationale is to override the defective IFN-gamma-R. IFN-alpha turns on similar downstream transcription factors and genes as IFN-gamma, leading to stabilization of the mycobacterial overload and initiation of the granuloma formation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, signaling through the IFN-alpha receptor in patients with MSMD was observed via flow cytometric assays following in vivo administration of IFN-alpha.</p><p>Several patients with AR complete IFN-gamma-R deficiencies have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in Europe and the United States. Complications have included fatal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), severe generalized granulomatous response, failure to clear infection, and gram-negative sepsis. One multi-institutional survey of eight patients who received 11 HCTs noted that four died and minimal to no engraftment was observed in two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The remaining two individuals in full remission five years after the procedure were the only patients administered non-T cell-depleted grafts from a human-leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling after a fully ablative regimen. Subsequently, another patient was successfully transplanted after myeloablative conditioning, in this case with an unrelated donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that the success of HCT may be related to the conditioning regimen rather than the source or the donor. It is also possible that the success of HCT is related to how well mycobacterial infection is controlled before transplantation, although one patient was successfully transplanted despite having active <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The clinical presentation of this form of MSMD is usually later in childhood or in adolescence. Patients with AD genotypes are from diverse ethnic backgrounds, yet present with severe, localized or disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) or nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections, histoplasmosis, or salmonellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/6,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21-23</a>]. Most patients with AD IFN-gamma-R deficiency develop multifocal NTM osteomyelitis, a manifestation that has become the hallmark for this genotype. In one series, 79 percent of patients had NTM osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Histology reveals more mature-looking paucibacillary granulomas, similar to those seen with AR partial IFN-gamma-R1 deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive partial interferon-gamma receptor deficiencies'</a> below.)</p><p>AD partial IFN-gamma-R1 deficiency is due to a small deletion hotspot in the intracellular domain of IFN-gamma-R1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this defect, the mutation is just beyond the transmembrane segment. It leads to a frame shift and premature truncation of IFN-gamma-R1 and elimination of the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and STAT1 binding sites. In addition, the receptor recycling domain that is next to the JAK1 binding site is also removed. This mutation is considered to have a &quot;dominant-negative&quot; effect because the product of the mutation adversely affects the function of the normal, wild-type gene product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/6,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24</a>]. Loss of the receptor recycling domain severely impairs the normal removal and recycling of the receptor from the cell surface. Mutant chains with intact extracellular domains can still bind IFN-gamma but fail to transduce the signal and do not get recycled, because the JAK1 and STAT1 binding motifs and the receptor-recycling domain are deleted. Overexpressed, abundant mutant receptors compete with wild-type receptors at the cell surface for binding IFN-gamma.</p><p>Flow cytometric analysis of monocytes from affected patients demonstrates a three- to fivefold increase in IFN-gamma-R1 expression compared with healthy control monocytes. However, STAT1 phosphorylation following in vitro stimulation with IFN-gamma is minimal or undetectable even at 100-fold higher concentrations of IFN-gamma.

The clinical phenotype may be milder than that of patients with complete defects. Patients tend to present later in life with rather limited disease. Affected patients can have normal granuloma formation.</p><p>AR partial IFN-gamma-R defects are often due to homozygous recessive missense mutations causing amino acid replacements in the extracellular domains or compound heterozygous mutations allowing a hypomorphic cellular phenotype with some IFN-gamma signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in STAT1 lead to impaired, but not fully abolished, responses to IFN-gamma. Homozygous mutations can lead to partial or complete deficiency of STAT1. These different mutations can present as MSMD or a combined immunodeficiency, with severity ranging from lethal in the first year of life to severe but curable infections.

Patients die in infancy in the absence of HCT.

Mutations reported to date include missense (L600P and Q123H, leading to the in-frame splicing out of coding exon 3), small frameshift deletions (1758_1759delAG), or frameshift insertions (1928insA). The three unrelated patients described with this deficiency all developed disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine-acquired infection. All died in infancy, one from herpes simplex encephalitis, another from an unidentified viral illness, and the third died from multiorgan failure secondary to fulminant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection three months after HCT.</p><p>A partial form of AR STAT1 deficiency with a milder MSMD phenotype has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. This form of STAT1 deficiency is caused by a hypomorphic missense mutation that leads to impaired splicing of STAT1 mRNA. The misspliced mRNA is not translated into a stable protein. However, the allele is hypofunctional because residual full-length mRNA is produced and translated, resulting in low levels of functional STAT1. GAF-mediated immunity is more impaired than ISGF3-mediated immunity. The two siblings identified with this defect both presented with recurrent and disseminated <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Other manifestations reported include recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, recurrent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonitis, and hepatosplenic mycobacterial disease.

It is thought to be a key regulator for early response in myeloid cells, including phagosome maturation, antigen processing, and antigen presentation.</p><p>Two types of IRF8 deficiency have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Haploinsufficiency of <em>GATA2</em> (located at 3q21.3) causes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, and it is now regarded as a bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">failure/infection</span> susceptibility defect.</p><p>Most commonly, GATA2 deficiency leads to the syndrome of monocytopenia and mycobacterial disease (MonoMAC), which is characterized by late childhood or adult onset of disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease or disseminated fungal disease. Hemograms in these patients are remarkable for absolute circulating monocytopenia, natural killer (NK) cell cytopenia, and B cell lymphopenia. However, tissue macrophages and plasma cells are present, and immunoglobulin levels are normal to elevated. This syndrome has also been called dendritic cell, monocyte, and B and natural killer (NK) lymphoid deficiency (DCML deficiency).

Progressive pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a feature seen in some patients, as is lymphedema. Another reported initial manifestation is severe diffuse parenchymal lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Cytogenetic abnormalities are sometimes seen in bone marrow (eg, trisomy 8 and monosomy 7). Other presentations of this syndrome include chronic neutropenia, aplastic anemia (AA), acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-specific-defects/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>].

IFN-gamma is a principal factor in the elimination of both <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and NTM. Genetic defects in the IFN-gamma pathway result in Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). Patients with defects in IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gamma-R1), IFN-gamma-R2, interleukin-12 receptor beta1 (IL-12Rbeta1), IL-12 p40, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), GATA2, and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) have been identified.

Almost all patients with AD IFN-gamma-R deficiency develop multifocal NTM osteomyelitis, the hallmark for this genotype. The clinical phenotype of partial defects in IFN-gamma-R1 or IFN-gamma-R2 is usually milder than that of patients with complete defects.
