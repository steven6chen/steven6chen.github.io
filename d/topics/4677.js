There is a broad array of clinical leishmaniasis syndromes; among these, the clinical course, treatment options, response to therapy, and prognosis are all highly variable. Treatment choices are complicated by the paucity of well-controlled comparative trials and lack of standardized outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) consists mainly of <em>L.L. major</em> and <em>L.L. tropica</em>. Less common species include <em>L.L. infantum-chagasi</em> and <em>L.L. aethiopica</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86988 \">table 1</a>). New World CL consists mainly of <em>L.L. mexicana</em>, <em>L.L. amazonensis</em>, and <em>Viannia</em> subgenus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86988 \">table 1</a>). Of these species, infection due to <em>L.V. braziliensis</em> and <em>L.V. guyanensis</em> are considered complicated due to risk for mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), although other species can cause mucosal leishmaniasis as well.

Many CL infections eventually resolve clinically without treatment, and not all patients who undergo treatment demonstrate elimination of parasitic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Treatment decisions must include consideration of individual risks and benefits (which can be complex given the large number of parasite species with variable clinical syndromes), complications, rates of spontaneous resolution, and patient preference.

The decision to pursue this approach should be made in conjunction with patient involvement. Reconsideration of treatment is warranted for patients managed with clinical observation who do not heal in four to six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H4101890031\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk for mucosal disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4273660\" class=\"local\">'Clinical follow up'</a> below.)</p><p>Local therapy is reasonable for patients with uncomplicated CL who are not already healing spontaneously <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who would like to pursue therapeutic intervention.

(See <a href=\"#H1791586\" class=\"local\">'Local therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Systemic therapy is warranted for patients with complicated CL, for immunocompromised patients, for patients with spontaneously healing or recently healed lesions whose infection is known to be caused by a <em>Leishmania</em> species associated with increased risk for ML, and for patients with healing lesions whose species is unknown but whose infection was acquired within an area with <em>Leishmania</em> species associated with increased risk for ML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Systemic therapy is also warranted for patients with less common syndromes including leishmaniasis recidivans, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis. (See <a href=\"#H3505033\" class=\"local\">'Overview of therapeutic approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4101890031\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk for mucosal disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-leishmaniasis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H83446472\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous leishmaniasis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of treatment include accelerated healing of skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], reduced likelihood of recurrence (especially in the setting of subsequent immune compromise), diminished severity of skin scarring and attendant emotional concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and reduced risk for metastatic infection (which is important for individuals with immune compromise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for individuals with infection due to <em>Viannia</em> subgenus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, in the setting of infection due to the anthroponotic species <em>L.L. tropica</em>, treatment may reduce the reservoir for transmission.</p><p>Consequences of no treatment or suboptimal treatment include scarring, superinfection, persistence of a chronic wound, and, for some <em>Leishmania</em> species, mucosal leishmaniasis that may be destructive or disfiguring. In immunocompromised individuals, dissemination may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4101890031\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessing risk for mucosal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, for Old World CL infection (eg, due to <em>L.L. tropica</em> or <em>L.L. major</em>) and for New World CL infection due to <em>L.L. mexicana</em>, the concern for later complications is relatively low and the lesions often heal in months. CL acquired in Central America north of Costa Rica, where <em>Viannia</em> subgenus is less frequently associated with ML, may not always require systemic therapy.</p><p>Systemic treatment for patients with CL acquired in the Americas south of Nicaragua is warranted, particularly in the setting of infection acquired in Brazil, Peru, or Bolivia. For these cases, a detailed nasal and oral examination must be performed to exclude mucosal involvement, which could modify treatment dosing and duration. Biopsy of the skin lesion with culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be pursued as species identification may guide assessment for risk of later mucosal dissemination. Testing the infecting parasite for <em>Leishmania</em> RNA virus (LRV1) to assess risk for later metastatic involvement may be useful, although this tool is not routinely available and has not been clinically validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].</p><p>The use of systemic therapy to reduce risk of ML is based on observational evidence; lower rates of ML have been observed among patients who completed CL therapy than among those who received partial or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, subsequent development of ML has been observed among individuals treated with antimonials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. A reevaluation of the limited evidence base provides a summary of the available published clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These risks and benefits should be reviewed with patients, and a determination regarding treatment approach should be made based on individual circumstances. Patients should be counseled about the signs and symptoms of relapse or of ML and should be followed for one to two years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3505033\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of therapeutic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic agents and dosing for treatment of CL are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88693 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The approach to treatment of CL is often influenced by the agents available. In the United States, there is one therapeutic agent with approval for treatment of CL by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miltefosine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miltefosine</a> is indicated for treatment of <em>L.V. braziliensis</em>, <em>L.V. guyanensis</em>, and <em>L.V. panamensis</em>. Other readily available treatment modalities include cryotherapy and thermotherapy. Relatively few dermatologists have experience treating CL via cryotherapy, and success correlates with experience. Thermotherapy devices may be less accessible; less skill with these devices is required for treatment success.</p><p>Available systemic agents in the United States include azoles, amphotericin deoxycholate, and liposomal amphotericin. The efficacy of azoles is limited, and the duration of treatment is prolonged. Therefore, many use parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> given accessibility and short duration, even though evidence for efficacy is limited and the optimal dose remains uncertain. Use of amphotericin deoxycholate is limited by duration and toxicity but is quite effective.</p><p>In the United States, pentavalent antimonials and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> are not available commercially but, in some cases, may be obtained via investigational new drug (IND) protocols.</p><p>Drug resistance varies by region; the same species may have variable response to a given drug depending on the geographic location. In addition, in some endemic areas, access to costly drugs and to species-level diagnosis for guiding treatment is limited. A species-directed review of treatment for CL in travelers provides evidence to support species identification to target therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1791586\"><span class=\"h3\">Local therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local therapy is warranted for patients with uncomplicated CL (see <a href=\"#H113484778\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat'</a> above). Local therapy is appropriate for management of Old World CL as well as for treatment of New World CL caused by species unlikely to cause disseminated infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86988\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86988 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110869\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110869 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one series including 105 returned travelers to France with primarily <em>L.L. major</em> and <em>L.L. infantum</em>, 62 percent were managed without systemic therapy; cure rates were 92 percent for wound care only and 79 percent for local therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There are few studies of intralesional therapy in New World CL acquired in the mucosal belt, but no ML cases were noted in follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Eschar(s) overlying ulcers should be debrided and secondary wound infection managed prior to administration of local therapy to maximize treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with subcutaneous nodules, regional adenopathy, and infection due to species associated with mucosal involvement should not be treated with local therapy alone, as it is unlikely to control the infection.</p><p>The efficacy of local cryotherapy is greatest using a treatment approach combining cryotherapy immediately followed by intralesional pentavalent antimony (Sb<sup>V</sup>), which is widely used globally but is not available in the United States. Use of cryotherapy alone is appropriate for relatively small, nonulcerated lesions of recent onset. Thermotherapy alone can be used as an alternative to cryotherapy for management of patients with uncomplicated Old World or New World CL presenting with few and relatively small (&le;25 mm) lesions. Thermotherapy and cryotherapy can also be used for follow-up management of residual lesions not fully healed after systemic treatment; in addition, both are acceptable for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> may be used for treatment of <strong>ulcerative</strong> lesions due to <em>L.L. major</em> or non-ML-associated Central American species; it is not generally used in conjunction with cryotherapy or thermotherapy. In Israel, use of topical paromomycin for treatment of <em>L.L. tropica</em> was effective in 70 percent of cases, so less than in <em>L.L. major,</em> but it could still be considered in individual patient situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the United States, the availability of topical paromomycin is limited to a compounded ointment prepared from capsules; the efficacy of such preparations is uncertain, and they have not been studied in clinical trials. WR279,396 (a topical cream containing 15% paromomycin and 0.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>) is no longer available and was replaced by 15% paromomycin cream available under IND protocol to United States military healthcare beneficiaries.</p><p>Photodynamic therapy is a relatively new therapy; thus far, it appears promising, although data are limited.</p><p>Specific agents for local therapy are discussed further below.

Clinical circumstances in which azoles have been used successfully include lymphocutaneous spread in the setting of non-ML-associated infection and cases in which the scope of cutaneous involvement is not amenable to local therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> may be useful for treatment of <em>L.L. major</em>, <em>L.L. mexicana</em>, and possibly <em>L.V. panamensis</em>. Azoles may be used in combination with cryo- or thermotherapy for treatment of <em>L.L. major</em> with lymphocutaneous involvement.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miltefosine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miltefosine</a> has reasonable efficacy against many New World CL species (compared with pentavalent antimonials). Data are limited regarding use of miltefosine for Old World CL, but it appears to have some efficacy. In the United States, miltefosine is available and FDA approved; this drug may become the treatment of choice for New World CL due to <em>Viannia </em>species.</p><p>Oral systemic therapy is discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H5913965\" class=\"local\">'Oral systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2036994\"><span class=\"h3\">Parenteral systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral agents for treatment of CL include pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88693 \">table 2</a>). The optimal agent depends on individual clinical circumstances.</p><p>Both pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin derivatives have activity against Old World and New World CL. Antimonials historically are generally the mainstay of systemic parenteral therapy of CL, given observed success with antimonials and toxicity associated with use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>. Small clinical series note liposomal amphotericin treatment efficacy of 80 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], but a European series including 41 patients (treated with a median cumulative dose of 20 mg per kg) noted only 46 percent were healed at 90 days post treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; the efficacy of liposomal amphotericin was greatest in patients with <em>L. infantum</em> infection and least in patients with <em>Viannia</em> infection. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pentamidine</a> is used largely for treatment of infection due to <em>L.V. guyanensis</em> but is generally a secondary therapy due to its adverse effect profile.</p><p>There are two parenteral pentavalent antimony agents: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-stibogluconate-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium stibogluconate</a> and meglumine antimoniate. The antimonial drugs have good efficacy for reducing risk of progression to mucosal disease in New World CL. Parenteral Sb<sup>V</sup> is the standard of care for infection due to <em>Viannia</em> subgenus acquired in South America, especially in the mucosal belt, except for known foci of high antimonial resistance such as Madidi National Park, Bolivia, Manu National Park, and Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Treatment with systemic antimonials is also appropriate in the setting of complicated Old World CL that has not responded to local therapy. In the United States, antimonial drugs are available only via an IND protocol.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> has the greatest efficacy against CL (based on case series, not controlled trials), but its use is somewhat limited by toxicity. Liposomal amphotericin circumvents some of the toxicity and may permit a shorter duration of treatment; further studies are needed to fully evaluate its use for treatment of CL, including the appropriate dose and duration. Liposomal amphotericin has become a commonly used agent for treatment of CL in regions where available.</p><p>Parenteral systemic therapy is discussed further below.

Cryotherapy may be used for infection of recent onset (less than three months' duration), disease with relatively few and relatively small lesions (&lt;3 cm), nodular lesions, and for individuals who cannot use systemic treatment. The efficacy of cryotherapy in clinical trials ranges from 53 to 100 percent; the efficacy is increased when cryotherapy is used in combination with intralesional pentavalent antimonials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p>In general, cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen consists of a freeze, thaw, freeze cycle, which causes intracellular ice to form, destroying cells, and leads to localized ischemic necrosis. It is important to treat into normal-appearing tissue around the lesions. One series including 293 patients in Saudi Arabia described a method of cryotherapy involving placement of a cotton-tipped applicator with liquid nitrogen directly on the lesion, freezing 15 to 20 seconds (until 1 to 2 mm of circumferential normal appearing skin appears frozen), thawing 20 to 60 seconds, and freezing again [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This sequence was repeated at three-week intervals up to three times or until healing occurred.</p><p>Adverse effects of cryotherapy include erythema, edema of the perilesional area, occasional blistering, permanent hypopigmentation (in dark-skinned individuals), hyperpigmentation, and scar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3505048\"><span class=\"h4\">Thermotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermatotrophic leishmaniasis species, such as <em>L.L. mexicana</em>, <em>L.L. major</em>, and <em>L.L. tropica</em>, are thermosensitive; their ability to replicate is limited at higher temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Heat treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis can be delivered by several methods; a radiofrequency instrument, ThermoMed, has received FDA approval for this purpose. Studies evaluating efficacy of radiofrequency thermotherapy for treatment of CL due to <em>L.L. major</em>, <em>L.L. tropica</em>, <em>L.V. panamensis</em>, and <em>L.V. braziliensis </em>have observed clinical cure rates of 54 to 73 percent at two to three months following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leishmaniasis-treatment/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p>The radiofrequency instrument is portable, battery operated, and delivers superficial heat to 50&deg;C via a set of prongs placed directly on the lesion. The treatment is painful, and local anesthesia is required. Prongs are touched to the lesion for 30-second heat intervals in a grid pattern over the lesion as well as a 1 to 2 mm border of normal-appearing skin. Most trials have used a single treatment session, although up to three treatments have been reported.

One treatment option for ML consists of parenteral pentavalent antimony in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> for synergistic activity. The use of amphotericin B is somewhat limited by toxicity (lessened when liposomal amphotericin is used), though case series have demonstrated that it is associated with a better response rate and lower relapse rate than pentavalent antimony.
