Expectorated sputum is often difficult to assess because many specimens are in fact mostly upper airway specimens and not sputum. The first and most important step in evaluation is the Gram stain. Gram stains are useful to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the suitability of the sputum specimen for further processing and interpretation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Predict a likely etiologic agent by identification of a predominant bacterial morphology in an adequate (purulent) specimen.</p><p/><p>Several guidelines have been proposed to evaluate the quality of sputum samples.

Our laboratory rejects all specimens with more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">SECs/LPF</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81458\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81458 \">picture 1</a>) without considering the number of PMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rejection criteria have not been evaluated for <em>Legionella</em>, mycobacteria, or dimorphic fungi, and our laboratory accepts sputum specimens for diagnosis of these pathogens without screening for cellular content.</p><p>If a submitted specimen is rejected as unsuitable for culture, the clinician should be notified and a repeat specimen should be requested. If Gram stains are used for screening, the suitability of each sputum sample should be assessed as soon as possible after the sample arrives in the laboratory in order to minimize delays in acquiring another sample.</p><p>A good quality sputum Gram stain may or may not be helpful in determining the bacteriologic etiology of pneumonia. Many purulent sputum specimens lack evidence of a single predominant morphologic type but rather contain multiple organisms. However, a specimen that does demonstrate a predominant organism can be quite useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75924 \">picture 2</a>). In fact, such samples may still provide useful diagnostic information, since some fastidious organisms clearly seen on Gram stain may be overgrown by indigenous respiratory flora on solid media (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>).</p><p>The sputum Gram stain has less utility in the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. In general, patients with atypical pneumonia have mucoid sputum with abundant PMNs and few or no organisms on Gram stain.

One study correlated Gram stain and culture results for 504 consecutive sputum samples obtained by endotracheal suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A mean of 4.05 organisms were recovered from the 15 percent of specimens with &gt;10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field <span class=\"nowrap\">(SEC/LPF),</span> compared with 2.35 organisms for specimens with fewer epithelial cells. The yield from culture was low (88 percent either no growth or normal oropharyngeal flora) when no organisms were visible by Gram stain. The authors of this study concluded that a laboratory that rejected endotracheal suctioned specimens with &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">SEC/LPF</span> or no organisms under high power could generate considerable savings for the institution.</p><p>Sputum culture results cannot be interpreted in the absence of clinical data in patients suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, especially those who are intubated. In patients suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, a positive sputum culture in association with the typical signs and symptoms (fever, peripheral leukocytosis, deteriorating oxygenation, change in quantity or character of sputum, or a new infiltrate on chest radiograph) are suggestive of pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Purulent sputum and a culture that grows a predominant organism may be indicative of tracheobronchitis, rather than parenchymal infection, in a patient without the clinical findings described above. Furthermore, in such a patient, a nonpurulent specimen growing a predominant organism is not indicative of respiratory tract infection and should not be used as an indication to start antimicrobial therapy. Hospitalized patients become colonized rapidly with enteric gram-negative bacilli with a frequency that is dictated by the severity of their associated conditions and prior antibiotic exposure. It is often difficult or impossible to determine the clinical significance of these organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SPUTUM CULTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine media used for the isolation and identification of respiratory pathogens include blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood agar supports the growth of gram-positive cocci and most gram-negative rods and is especially useful for evaluation of the colony morphology and hemolysis of streptococci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chocolate agar permits recovery of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> and other fastidious organisms that may grow less well on blood agar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MacConkey agar is selective for gram-negative bacteria and allows further classification into lactose-positive or -negative organisms, based upon their ability to ferment lactose.</p><p/><p>Specialized media is required for culture of atypical pathogens such as <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-legionella-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Legionella infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The laboratory should be notified when respiratory specimens are sent from patients with cystic fibrosis so that special media and processing can be used to detect pathogens of particular interest in this patient population, such as <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture results are reported in a semiquantitative manner (1+ to 4+ in some laboratories; rare, few, moderate, or abundant in others). Most true pathogens are present in at least 3+ (moderate) amounts. When the same organism is detected from respiratory and blood cultures concurrently, it is strongly suggestive that the respiratory tract is the source of the bacteremia. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia must be based on clinical, rather than laboratory, criteria.</p><p>As stated above, sputum cultures may not yield a specific pathogen. Since the oropharynx and upper airway are virtually always colonized with indigenous flora, cultures of expectorated sputum will often grow mixed flora, even in the absence of bacterial lower respiratory tract infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66953\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66953 \">picture 3</a>). For some organisms, the concentration in culture is important, and clinical correlation is critical.</p><p>The yield of sputum cultures is further diminished if the patient has received antibiotics prior to producing the specimen, which occurs frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The greatest problem in this regard is with fastidious pathogens, such as <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em>. The experienced technologist can select colonies with morphologies consistent with known respiratory pathogens, but their presence, especially in a mixed specimen, does not equate with causality.</p><p>Organisms can also colonize the respiratory tract, especially in patients with chronic illnesses or recent hospitalization. Thus, any positive sputum culture result must be interpreted in the context of the clinical setting. Some organisms are virtually never pulmonary pathogens, such as <em>Candida</em> spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, gram-positive bacilli other than <em>Nocardia</em>, <em>H. parainfluenzae</em>, and streptococci other than <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. pyogenes</em>, <em>S. agalactiae</em>, and <em>S. anginosus</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimens obtained via bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopy can be used to acquire samples of lower respiratory tract secretions in patients with suspected pneumonia in whom respiratory samples cannot be obtained by expectoration or in whom such samples have been nondiagnostic. Lower respiratory specimens can be obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, routine brushing, washing, or protected specimen brushing (using a double-sheathed catheter that minimizes bacterial contamination). A variety of quantitative culture methods have been developed to differentiate infection from colonization and to identify pathogenic organisms in the fluid obtained, but none of these methods is completely reliable. The utility of quantitative cultures of specimens obtained by bronchoscopy has been highly variable in individual patients and in various studies. The role of bronchoscopic sampling and quantitative cultures, which have been best studied in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia#H322290\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive respiratory sampling'</a>.)</p><p>When bronchoscopy is used, it is imperative that specimen handling be optimized, since fastidious organisms may not survive prolonged transport times. In addition, use of a diluent such as bacteriostatic saline in bronchoalveolar lavage or brush specimens can inhibit the growth of microorganisms, possibly leading to false-negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Bronchoscopy for specimen collection is most useful for the diagnosis of infection due to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> in patients with negative sputum studies, for <em>P. jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) or other fungal or viral pathogens, or for establishing a noninfectious etiology such as malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
