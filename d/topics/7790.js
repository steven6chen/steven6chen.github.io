The fibrils are Congo red-positive in <strong>amyloidosis</strong> and Congo red-negative in other forms. The most common forms of Congo red-negative (nonamyloid) fibrillar glomerular deposition diseases are <strong>fibrillary glomerulonephritis</strong> and <strong>immunotactoid glomerulopathy</strong>.</p><p>Fibrillary glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>] and immunotactoid glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-9</a>] are uncommon causes of glomerular disease. Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from immunoglobulins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The pathognomonic histologic findings are seen on electron microscopy. By comparison, other forms of nonamyloid fibrillary deposition disease have been described in which the deposits are composed of fibronectin (fibronectin glomerulopathy) or atypical type III collagen fibrils (collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other fibrillary disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Glomerular disease associated with amyloid deposits is discussed separately.

Most investigators feel that, based upon histologic features and clinical associations, fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders, with fibrillary glomerulonephritis accounting for approximately 85 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8</a>]. However, some believe that they are pathogenetically related, with no compelling histologic or clinical reasons to separate the two.

These include focal mesangial or diffuse proliferative or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (with or without crescent formation), a membranous pattern, and mesangial expansion with amorphous material that may be suggestive of amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74384\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74384 \">picture 1</a>). In a study of 66 patients, the most common histologic patterns were <span class=\"nowrap\">mesangioproliferative/sclerosing</span> glomerulonephritis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, which were observed in 71 percent and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy is positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG), C3, and both kappa and lambda (ie, polyclonal) light chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/1,4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,10,11</a>]. There may be selective deposition of some IgG subclasses. In a single-center series of 67 patients, 61 of whom had fibrillary glomerulonephritis, immunofluorescence microscopy in 19 cases found oligotypic deposits (all with IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses) in 15, with the remaining four having monotypic deposits (two IgG1 and two IgG4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IgA, IgM and C1q deposition may also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The fibrillary deposits may be so extensive that the IgG deposition may be linear, similar to that seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61547 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/1,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12</a>].</p><p>The pathognomonic histologic findings are seen on electron microscopy, which shows random fibrillar deposits in the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls that are clearly distinct from those seen in amyloidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82244\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82244 \">picture 3</a>). The fibrils are larger than those in amyloidosis (16 to 24 nm in fibrillary glomerulonephritis and 30 to 50 nm in immunotactoid glomerulopathy versus 10 nm in diameter in amyloidosis). In addition to being smaller, the fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72813\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72813 \">picture 4</a>) are more randomly arranged than those observed in immunotactoid glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p>In contrast to amyloid fibrils, the fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis do not stain with Congo red or thioflavine-T or with antibodies to a specific light chain (either lambda or kappa) or to serum amyloid A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. It is likely that many cases previously diagnosed as &quot;Congo red-negative&quot; amyloidosis were in fact fibrillary glomerulonephritis.</p><p>Fibrillary glomerulonephritis was initially considered to be an idiopathic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, approximately one-third of patients have a history of malignancy, monoclonal gammopathy, or autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Proteomic studies have identified DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B9 (DNAJB9) as a potential novel biomarker for the diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. DNAJB9, a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, was found to be highly enriched in the glomeruli of patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis but not in those of patients with amyloidosis or other glomerular diseases or healthy subjects. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed positive staining for DNAJB9 in glomerular capillary walls and the mesangium of all patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis, while no staining was observed in patients with amyloidosis or other glomerular diseases or healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated localization of DNAJB9 to fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis but not to amyloid fibrils or immunotactoid glomerulopathy microtubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Colocalization of staining for DNAJB9 and IgG within glomerular deposits suggested that DNAJB9 could represent a putative autoantigen in fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Collectively, these findings suggest that detection of DNAJB9 by immunofluorescence microscopy could establish the diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulonephritis without the need for electron microscopy. However, further studies are required to confirm these observations and to determine the role of DNAJB9 in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunotactoid glomerulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunotactoid glomerulopathy, in contrast to fibrillary glomerulonephritis, is characterized by the formation of microtubules on electron microscopy. In addition, these microtubules are much larger than the fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis (30 to 50 versus 16 to 24 nm in diameter) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72813\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72813 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/2,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,9</a>]. Many patients have either a circulating paraprotein or monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition in the glomeruli on immunofluorescence microscopy with a restricted light chain, either kappa or lambda (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/3,6,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,11</a>]. Some authors call this disorder glomerulonephritis with organized monoclonal microtubular immunoglobulin deposits (GOMMID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a study of 14 patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy, glomerular deposits were monotypic in 13 patients who also had a <strong>monoclonal</strong> immunoglobulin of the same isotype in the serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the cytoplasm of lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, a lymphoproliferative disease was observed in seven patients. By comparison, none of nine patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis had a paraprotein or a lymphoproliferative disorder, while eight of the nine patients had <strong>polyclonal</strong> immunoglobulin glomerular deposits.</p><p>Thus, a careful search for a lymphoproliferative disease should be part of the routine evaluation of patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">One or two disorders?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/2,3,8,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8,11,16</a>]. The identification of the protein DNAJB9 in the glomeruli of patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis but not in those with immunotactoid glomerulopathy suggests that the two are distinct disease entities. However, some believe they are pathogenetically related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Despite the usual histologic distinctions, some features may not be unique to fibrillary or immunotactoid disease. As an example, there is some overlap in the size of the fibrils in patients thought to have one or the other disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, the presence of hollow electron-lucent microtubule fibrils has been described in both forms and it may be difficult to distinguish between these disorders clinically.</p><p>The fibril or microtubule deposition in these conditions is almost always limited to the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are, however, several observations which are consistent with a <strong>systemic</strong> rather than an intrarenal disease among patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both disorders can recur in the renal transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4,5,8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8,17,18</a>].

In a study of 186 patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis or immunotactoid glomerulopathy, the 12 patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy had a much higher rate of a paraprotein with or without a lymphoproliferative neoplasia than patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis (33 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In two of these six series, for example, seven of fifteen patients had mild disease at the time of renal biopsy as defined by a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate and non-nephrotic-range proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110158364\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonimmunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate and non-nephrotic-range proteinuria are usually treated conservatively with angiotensin blockade in order to control blood pressure, reduce protein excretion, and slow the progression of the disease.

The rationale for such an approach is based upon the observation that patients with a membranoproliferative pattern of injury progress faster to end-stage renal disease than patients with a mesangioproliferative pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, as discussed above, the mesangioproliferative pattern may represent an earlier stage of pathogenic process rather than milder disease. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that, when renal histology was stratified by immunosuppressive therapy, there was no effect of immunosuppression on the rate of progression to end-stage renal disease.

Thus, a careful search for a secondary cause should be part of the routine evaluation of these disorders. Ongoing screening may be warranted since these disorders can first be detected <strong>after</strong> the diagnosis of the renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H110153761\" class=\"local\">'Screening for associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p>Effective therapy directed at the underlying disorder appears to have a beneficial effect on the renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/11,21,30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21,30,35</a>].

Patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis had survival rates on dialysis that were comparable to those of patients with other causes of end-stage renal disease. However, patients with immunotactoid glomerulopathy had inferior survival on dialysis.

Other rare glomerular diseases associated with fibrillar deposits include fibronectin glomerulopathy and collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy. Whereas the overwhelming majority of amyloid fibrils are typically Congo red-positive, very early amyloidosis can be Congo red-negative. Similarly, cases of heavy chain amyloidosis can be Congo red-negative, but precise diagnosis can be achieved by mass spectrometry-based proteomic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-diseases-due-to-nonamyloid-fibrillar-deposits/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. All other forms of fibrillary deposition disease are characterized by Congo red-negative fibrils. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other fibrillary disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by electron microscopy; the fibrils that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and typically randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and often organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy. The light microscopic findings for both are variable and include focal or diffuse glomerulonephritis with or without crescent formation, a membranous pattern, a membranoproliferative and an amyloid-like pattern. DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B9 (DNAJB9), detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in patients with fibrillary glomerulonephritis but not in those with immunotactoid glomerulopathy, may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulonephritis.

Approximately half of the patients develop end-stage renal disease within two to six years. Both disorders can recur in the renal transplant. Recurrence is especially likely in patients with monoclonal gammopathy and fibrillary deposits on renal biopsy.
