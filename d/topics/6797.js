The evaluation of bleeding in children and adults is discussed separately.

Purpura can be subdivided based on size into petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73905 \">picture 1</a>) and ecchymoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59402 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-purpura-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pinpoint areas (less than 2 mm) of hemorrhage, which are reddish-purple lesions are called petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73905 \">picture 1</a>), while larger confluent lesions are referred to as ecchymoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59402 \">picture 2</a>). Ecchymoses are commonly called bruises. In some cases, ecchymoses may be tender or raised. In contrast to other erythematous or vascular skin lesions, purpuric lesions do not blanch when pressure is applied to the skin.</p><p>Careful evaluation of any patient with purpura is important for early diagnosis and treatment, particularly in children who are ill-appearing. The type, location, and extent of the purpura, along with the overall appearance of the child, will help guide the initial evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Purpura may result from disruptions in vascular integrity (trauma, infection, vasculitis, collagen disorders) or may be due to abnormalities in primary or secondary hemostasis (thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, clotting factor deficiency, or abnormal clotting factor function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-purpura-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Complex mechanisms maintain vascular integrity and limit the flow of blood when a blood vessel is damaged:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin C and other factors that affect collagen synthesis are required for normal formation of connective tissue within the vessel walls. When a blood vessel is injured, vasoconstriction and retraction usually occur immediately and decrease the flow of blood to the affected area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of a platelet plug, also referred to as primary hemostasis, is initiated upon injury to a blood vessel wall:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Circulating platelets recognize subendothelial collagen and von Willebrand factor, and adhere to the injured area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, platelets are rapidly activated, resulting in the release of platelet granules.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>This granule release attracts other circulating platelets, which bind to activated platelets causing platelet aggregation, and the formation of a platelet plug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The platelet plug alone is not sufficient, and requires the second phase of hemostasis to form a stable fibrin clot. This second phase is initiated when tissue factor (which is exposed on the endothelial cell after injury) binds to factor VII. This proteolytic TF-VIIa complex activates factor X to Xa and factor IX to IXa, initiating a series of cascading reactions whose central purpose is to generate thrombin from prothrombin (II) at the site of injury. There are multiple coagulation proteins that are necessary for this cascade. Thrombin can then cleave fibrinogen to fibrin, which is cross-linked and forms a clot. These reactions occur on the phospholipid surface of platelets. The coagulation cascade is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DISRUPTIONS IN VASCULAR INTEGRITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma is the most common etiology of purpura in children.</p><p>Non-blanching purpura from unintentional trauma vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters and are frequently located over extensor surfaces of the lower legs, bony prominences including the knees and elbows, and the forehead. It is not possible to reliably predict the age of an ecchymoses based on its color. However, red, blue, or purple bruises suggest recent lesions. Yellow, brown, or green bruises tend to be older, healing lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1593427205\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Inflicted bruises'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the presence of purpura on the face, back, upper arms, or soft tissue areas including buttocks, genitals, and upper thigh may suggest the possibility of intentional trauma. Bruising is the most common presenting feature of physical abuse in children. Other patterns of bruising that are suggestive of non-accidental trauma are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 1</a>).

It is a result of microvascular thrombosis that leads to tissue necrosis, skin infarction and hemorrhage. Patients with PF are extremely ill-appearing, with fever, hypotension, and bleeding. Laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of meningococcal infection&quot;, section on 'Purpura fulminans'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The lesions of PF have a characteristic appearance, which helps to distinguish them from other purpuric lesions. Erythema is followed by central areas of blue or black hemorrhagic necrosis with a surrounding erythematous border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52107\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107 \">picture 3</a>). The lesions are painful and indurated.</p><p>Viral infections, including parvovirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, and Rickettsial infections have also been associated with the development of purpuric lesions in children.

The clinical manifestations of IgAV (HSP)are due to IgA1 deposition in blood vessel walls and the renal mesangium. Cutaneous purpura is an essential component in the diagnosis of IgAV (HSP) and is characterized by palpable purpuric lesions 2 to 10 mm in diameter that often coalesce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63367%7EPEDS%2F72094\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63367 graphicRef72094 \">picture 4A-B</a>). The purpura tend to be concentrated on the buttocks and lower extremities. Other clinical manifestations of IgAV (HSP) include arthritis (commonly of the knees and ankles), abdominal pain with or without gastrointestinal bleeding, and nephritis.

These include sulfonamides, penicillins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloral-hydrate-united-states-not-available-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloral hydrate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-purpura-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Drug induced vasculitis usually develops within 7 to 21 days of starting the drug and may be confined to the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal purpura fulminans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal purpura fulminans usually occurs on the first day of life and is caused by congenital severe deficiency of protein C or protein S. Affected infants present with ecchymoses, extensive venous and arterial thromboses, laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and extremely low levels of protein C antigen (less than 1 percent of normal).</p><p>Administration of exogenous protein replacement (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-concentrate-from-human-plasma-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Protein C concentrate</a> or fresh frozen plasma) appears to be critical for the treatment of neonatal purpura fulminans, while heparin and antiplatelet agents are ineffective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency#H547188449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;, section on 'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a>.)</p><p>Severe acquired deficiency of the anticoagulant proteins, protein C and protein S, may also present with non-infectious purpura fulminans or in association with infectious disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

It may occur in individuals with severely restricted diets (anorexia, neurodevelopmental delay, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperalimentation without vitamin C supplementation). Vitamin C deficiency results in impaired collagen synthesis.</p><p>The typical pathologic manifestations of vitamin C deficiency are noted in collagen-containing tissues and in organs and tissues such as skin, cartilage, dentin, osteoid, and capillary blood vessels. Scurvy may present with gum bleeding, petechiae or ecchymoses. In addition, the prominence of hair follicles on the thighs and buttocks and the eruption of coiled, fragmented hair with a characteristic corkscrew appearance are specific features of vitamin C deficiency. Petechiae found on the skin have a characteristic pale halo ring around a central erythematous core (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64172 \">picture 5</a>). These lesions heal rapidly after the administration of vitamin C.

This heterogeneous group is characterized by joint hypermobility, cutaneous fragility, and hyperextensibility. Fragility of dermal skin is common, with frequent bruises and delayed wound healing. In some cases, abnormal blood vessel structure causes capillary hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1883437202\"><span class=\"h2\">Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PPDs, also known as capillaritis, purpura simplex, and inflammatory purpura without vasculitis, are a group of chronic, benign, cutaneous eruptions characterized by the presence of petechiae, purpura, and increased skin pigmentation. PPDs most commonly occur on the lower extremities and may be asymptomatic or pruritic. The presence of discrete or circumscribed purpuric macules, papules, patches, or plaques (particularly on the lower extremity) with petechiae and yellow-brown pigmentation suggests the possibility of PPDs. The diagnosis is usually made through clinical inspection and the recognition of classic clinical features. A skin biopsy is useful when the diagnosis remains uncertain following clinical examination. Biopsies may help to distinguish PPD from disorders in the differential diagnosis, such as cutaneous vasculitis. There are several different subtypes of PPD, although Schamberg&rsquo;s disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67127\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67127 \">picture 6</a>) is the most common.

These conditions may be inherited or acquired. The normal platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;150,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. In the majority of situations, thrombocytopenia is acquired.

This immune mediated disorder is characterized by the sudden development of petechiae and ecchymoses in an otherwise healthy child, although symptoms may occasionally develop more gradually. Epistaxis occurs in 10 to 20 percent, and although more serious bleeding may occur, it is uncommon. ITP occurs most frequently in children between the ages of one to five years, but also occurs in older children and adults. In young children, the development of ITP is often preceded by a mild viral illness. The diagnosis of ITP is based upon two clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated thrombocytopenia, with otherwise normal blood counts and peripheral blood smear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No clinically apparent associated conditions that may cause thrombocytopenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HUS is a disease that primarily affects young children and is characterized by the triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic anemia, and acute renal failure. Patients may rarely manifest purpura. HUS can be divided into two forms based upon clinical presentation: Typical HUS is most common and usually follows a prodromal infectious disease, most commonly diarrhea, and less frequently an upper respiratory infection. This syndrome is classically associated with Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;, section on 'Thrombocytopenia'</a>). Atypical HUS is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by the absence of diarrhea.

The classic pentad includes thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, renal dysfunction, and neurologic abnormalities. It is a usually a result of deficiency of the ADAMTS-13 protease, which is responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. Without this cleavage, ultra large VWF multimers circulate, stimulating microvascular platelet thrombi which cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. TTP is most often a result of antibody mediated destruction of ADAMTS-13. However, a rare autosomal recessive inherited deficiency of ADAMTS-13 can cause TTP in young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia may be an early manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Most notable in this group in children are acute leukemia and neuroblastoma. In the majority of cases, hematologic abnormalities other than thrombocytopenia are also present (eg, anemia, leukopenia, or leukocytosis), but occasionally a decrease in the platelet count may be the only abnormality.

The mother forms IgG class antiplatelet antibodies against the &quot;foreign&quot; antigen; these cross the placenta and destroy fetal platelets, resulting in fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia. Plasma levels of thrombopoietin in these patients are normal because the megakaryocytes and platelets that are produced bind to this growth factor. In contrast to Rh sensitization, NAIT often develops in the first pregnancy of an at-risk couple.</p><p>NAIT can result in severe thrombocytopenia in the fetus because platelet antigens form early in gestation and maternal antibodies cross the placenta in early midtrimester. The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage, which occurs in approximately 10 to 20 percent of affected newborns; one-quarter to one-half of these occur in utero. The risk of severe thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage is greater in alloimmune than in autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

In Bernard-Soulier syndrome the platelet count may be decreased, but, characteristically, the platelets are large, often the size of red blood cells, and may be missed because most automatic counters do not count them as platelets. Both Bernard-Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann thrombasthenia are characterized by life-long bleeding.</p><p>Other more common, but less severe, platelet function abnormalities include storage pool defects (eg, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome) or mild secretion defects.

A single dose of aspirin can irreversibly alter platelet function by blocking the normal pathway of thromboxane-induced platelet aggregation. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, have a similar mechanism of action, but the effects are reversible and the disruption of platelet function is less pronounced.

The most commonly encountered congenital deficiencies are von Willebrand disease, hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Although the latter two disorders have an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, the de novo appearance of coagulopathy is not uncommon, particularly in children with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity less than 1 percent). Therefore, a family history of affected males may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of hemophilia, but the absence of such a history does not eliminate this diagnostic possibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Von Willebrand disease (VWD)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VWD is the most common congenital bleeding disorder, present in approximately 1 percent of the population. It is actually a collection of disorders characterized by either quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of von Willebrand factor (vWf). VWD affects males and females equally and is generally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. VWD should be suspected in patients with a history of easy bruising, mucous membrane bleeding (epistaxis, menorrhagia), or prolonged bleeding after a surgical procedure (eg, post-tooth extraction). In contrast to hemophilia, joint and muscle bleeds are very uncommon in VWD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemophilia, the most common inherited severe bleeding disorder, is an X-linked disorder that affects males of all ethnic groups. Hemophilia A (deficiency of factor VIII) occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 live male births and is five to six times more common than Hemophilia B (deficiency of factor IX). The severity of hemophilia is classified according to the amount of circulating functional clotting factor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 1 percent &ndash; Severe disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 to 5 percent &ndash; Moderate disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 5 percent &ndash; Mild disease</p><p/><p>Patients with severe hemophilia experience frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes, in contrast to those with moderate or mild hemophilia in whom trauma or surgery is usually required to provoke hemorrhage. Although bleeding can occur in almost any site, hemarthrosis (intra-articular bleeding) is the most common clinical manifestation, and the ankles, knees, and elbows are most frequently affected.</p><p>Children with hemophilia often come to medical attention when they develop purpura either spontaneously or after mild trauma. The ecchymoses in boys with hemophilia are often quite pronounced and palpable for the degree of trauma. The diagnosis of hemophilia should also be entertained in newborns who develop excessive bleeding after circumcision and in infants with prolonged bleeding from lacerations of the lip, tongue, or frenulum. Prompt recognition of the disorder at this early age allows for careful surveillance, appropriate treatment, and early genetic counseling for parents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Other congenital factor deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While VWD and hemophilia A and B represent the majority of inherited bleeding disorders, hereditary deficiencies of other clotting factors may also be encountered. Deficiencies of the following factors result in clinical bleeding: II, V, X, VII, XI, XIII, and fibrinogen. These are all autosomal traits, and are usually symptomatic only in patients with homozygous deficiencies. Most patients with the above deficiencies will have an abnormal PT or aPTT. The diagnosis requires specific factor assays. Patients with factor XIII deficiency will have normal screening tests and can be diagnosed with a factor XIII functional assay that assays clot solubility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamin K deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin K is an essential fat-soluble vitamin that is required for the post-translational gamma-carboxylation of several of the clotting factors. The clotting factors that are vitamin K dependent are: II, VII, IX, and X. Deficiency of vitamin K leads to low levels of these clotting factors which may present with purpura or more systemic bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, with clinical manifestations that range from purpura to intracranial hemorrhage, may occur in infants who do not receive prophylactic vitamin K at birth. This important step in normal newborn care may be overlooked when infants are born at home, or when problems develop in the delivery room and vitamin K is not given. The classic form presents in the first week of life, and the late form presents between two weeks and six months of life. The deficiency is the result of inadequate stores of vitamin K due to maternal deficiency or exclusive breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-k#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin K&quot;, section on 'Vitamin K deficient bleeding in newborns and young infants'</a>.)</p><p>Vitamin K deficiency may occur in older children with malabsorption or chronic diarrhea. Ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> or long-acting superwarfarin rat poisons (eg, brodifacoum), which interferes with the metabolism of vitamin K, may also present with purpura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of clotting factors are produced in the liver.

In addition, the intravascular consumption of clotting factors may cause purpura because of factor depletion and, in severe cases, may lead to widespread, rapidly progressing purpuric lesions (purpura fulminans) associated with thrombosis or emboli.</p><p>Infections are the most common cause of DIC in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59455 \">table 3</a>). Although other signs of serious illness are usually present in the child with purpura caused by DIC, fever and purpura may be the only significant findings in the early stages of severe bacterial infections such as meningococcemia. Further investigations and appropriate therapy should proceed rapidly in such instances. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated intravascular coagulation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a child with purpura must combine speed and skill. Purpura can be the initial sign of a life threatening meningococcal infection, requiring immediate treatment, or the first sign of child abuse, requiring patient, thorough investigation. The initial approach should be dictated by the general appearance of the child and the presenting vital signs. A well-appearing child with purpura and normal vital signs can be approached with less urgency than a febrile, lethargic child with purpura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By taking into account the patient's age, sex, clinical presentation, past medical history, and family history, the most likely causes of purpura can usually be determined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Serious infection is an important cause of purpura in children and is usually associated with fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of patient &ndash; Severe congenital bleeding disorders usually present in the first year of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex of patient &ndash; Hemophilia is X-linked and only affects males (with rare-exception). Von Willebrand is autosomal dominant and is seen with equal frequency in boys and girls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of symptoms &ndash; The patient's recent and past medical history should be reviewed carefully with the parents and child. Acute onset of purpura after a recent viral illness or immunization is consistent with an acquired disorder such as ITP. Recurrent purpura since infancy, however, suggests an inherited abnormality of platelets or clotting factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location and type of purpura &ndash; The site and type of bleeding manifestation may be helpful in establishing the alteration in the hemostatic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 4</a>). Petechiae are most commonly seen in patients with thrombocytopenia and platelet disorders, mucosal bleeding (menorrhagia, epistaxis) is common in platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease, and bleeding into the joints (hemarthroses) is common in patients with hemophilia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior bleeding history &ndash; Specific inquiries about past surgeries (including circumcision), dental extractions, or significant trauma should be made because the absence of bleeding under these conditions would be unusual in most inherited disorders of even moderate severity. When previous bleeding has occurred, the site of bleeding may be helpful in establishing the alteration in the hemostatic mechanisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of bleeding &ndash; The family history should be reviewed for purpura or bleeding disorders. A positive family history in male relatives on the maternal side suggests factor VIII or factor IX deficiency. A history of bleeding or bruising in numerous family members of both sexes suggests a condition with dominant inheritance such as von Willebrand's disease. As noted earlier, however, a negative family history does not preclude the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease or hemophilia.
