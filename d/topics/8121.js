Their detection in the liver may be the first clue to an ongoing systemic disease. Although the granulomas themselves rarely cause structural liver damage, it is important to identify the underlying systemic disease since it might have prognostic and therapeutic implications. Careful consideration of associated clinical symptoms and characterization of the appearance and localization of the granulomas within the liver usually leads to a definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A granuloma is a circumscribed lesion that forms as a result of an inflammatory reaction in body tissues. It is characterized by a central accumulation of mononuclear cells, primarily macrophages, with a surrounding rim consisting of lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The lesions are distinct from nearby uninvolved tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64126\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64126 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Early in the development of the granuloma, lesions may appear as punched-out clusters of histiocytes or lymphocytes. The granulomas evolve with stimulation of mononuclear cells from a variety of cytokines. Activated macrophages are transformed to resemble epithelial cells (referred to as epithelioid cells), which characteristically have abundant, pale cytoplasm. Adjacent macrophages may fuse, forming multinucleated giant cells. Granulomas infiltrated by eosinophils are suggestive of a drug reaction or parasitic infection.</p><p>The cells within the granuloma are capable of secreting a variety of proteins. As an example, epithelioid cells from patients with sarcoidosis secrete lysozyme, collagenase, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Elevated serum levels of ACE are characteristic of active sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The histologic features of the granulomas and their location may be helpful for narrowing the differential diagnosis. Four histologic variants of hepatic granulomas have been recognized, the first two of which are most common in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncaseating - such as seen with sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caseating &ndash; which are characterized by central necrosis. A common example is tuberculosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin-ring &ndash; in which epithelioid cells surround a vacuole that often has an encircling fibrin ring. Conditions associated with fibrin-ring granulomas include, Hodgkin lymphoma, cytomegalovirus (CMV), leishmaniasis, hepatitis A, toxoplasmosis, giant cell arteritis, Boutonneuse fever, and Q fever, and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipogranulomas &ndash; which contain a central lipid vacuole (usually seen in patients who ingest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>).</p><p/><p>Granulomas can be located throughout the hepatic lobule. However, a tendency to be located in specific sites is recognized in some disorders. Examples include the portal or periportal location of granulomas in sarcoidosis, and the portal location in primary biliary cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of granulomatous liver disease depend upon the underlying cause and its severity. Fever is the most common clinical symptom (especially in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and infectious causes). Patients may also experience night sweats and weight loss. Hepatomegaly may be present. Portal hypertension is seen only in cases of sarcoid, primary biliary cirrhosis, and schistosomiasis.</p><p>On the other hand, in many patients, minor elevations in serum aminotransferases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alkaline phosphatase may be the initial clue. However, the serum alkaline phosphatase can be normal. In other patients, the clinical features reflect the underlying systemic disease. The diagnosis is established by liver biopsy and by specific testing for the underlying diseases. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulomas in the liver are associated with a myriad of disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the prevalence of which depends upon geographic location and the specific population. They may also be an incidental finding on otherwise normal liver biopsy specimens. Thus, an isolated granuloma (or perhaps two on a large liver biopsy specimen) does not necessarily indicate the presence of granulomatous liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, granulomas encountered in patients with known forms of liver disease (such as hepatitis B) may represent an incidental finding that has no bearing on clinical manifestations or response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The most frequent causes of hepatic granulomas in the United States are sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions, which account for approximately 50 to 75 percent of hepatic granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Other diagnoses should be considered in specific settings. As an example, <em>Leishmania tropica</em>, which usually causes cutaneous disease only, was associated with hepatic granuloma formation in United States soldiers returning from Iraq after operation Desert Storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>It is helpful to conceptualize the different causes of hepatic granulomas by subdividing them into broad general categories, including those associated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic</p><p/><p>The following section will summarize disorders within these categories while focusing on some of the more common causes of hepatic granulomas within each category.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among diseases thought to have an autoimmune etiology, sarcoidosis and primary biliary cirrhosis are most commonly associated with hepatic granulomas. Hepatic granulomas may also be seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and with polymyalgia rheumatica. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Sarcoidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by the formation of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. Symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis occurs in 5 to 15 percent of patients with sarcoidosis, although the incidence of subclinical involvement is much higher. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-and-hepatic-sarcoidosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal and hepatic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Hepatic'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients are asymptomatic and have only biochemical abnormalities (usually an elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase). Clinically apparent liver disease is uncommon even in patients who have numerous hepatic granulomas. Rare patients develop cholestatic liver disease, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic vein thrombosis. </p><p>While sarcoid granulomas are often located in the portal tract, there are no pathognomonic laboratory or histopathologic findings that can establish the diagnosis of hepatic sarcoidosis. Thus, the additional steps of identifying characteristic extrahepatic manifestations of sarcoidosis (eg, cutaneous manifestations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest x-ray abnormalities), and ruling out other possible causes such as infection (particularly mycobacterial and fungal), drug-induced granulomas, and malignancy, are essential to making a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-and-hepatic-sarcoidosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal and hepatic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Hepatic'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis depends upon the clinical manifestations of the disease. As mentioned above, the majority of patients are asymptomatic and thus do not require specific treatment. The treatment of symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis often involves treatment with a glucocorticoid. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> may be beneficial for patients with pruritus due to cholestatic jaundice. The treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-and-hepatic-sarcoidosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal and hepatic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary biliary cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is characterized by an ongoing immunologic attack on the intralobular bile ducts that eventually leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. The liver profile and hepatic histology may mimic sarcoidosis. As mentioned above, some patients with sarcoidosis develop cholestatic liver disease resembling PBC. However, the disorders can usually be distinguished by the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies in PBC and the patient demographics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common infections causing granulomatous liver disease in the United States include tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related infectious diseases (eg, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cryptococcal infections), and fungal infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Elsewhere in the world, schistosomiasis, leprosy, brucellosis, and Q fever are also common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81043 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic granulomas are present in more than 90 percent of patients with miliary tuberculosis, approximately 70 percent of those with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and about 25 percent of patients with what appear to be isolated pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Symptoms including fever, night sweats, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss may be nonspecific. Serum aminotransferases may be minimally elevated and jaundice is rare. Granulomas are characteristically found in the portal areas and may or may not caseate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Acid-fast bacilli can occasionally be seen within the granulomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-miliary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of miliary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">AIDS related causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIDS patients are susceptible to a variety of conditions that may be associated with hepatic granulomas. Infectious etiologies include mycobacteria (eg, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and MAC), <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, cytomegalovirus (CMV), histoplasmosis, and toxoplasmosis. In addition, many of the medications used to treat these infections may themselves be associated with granulomas. Examples include sulfonamides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Fungal diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common diseases associated with hepatic granulomas are histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, candidiasis, and blastomycosis (see appropriate topic reviews). Histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis should be considered in patients living in endemic areas (southern and central regions of the United States for histoplasmosis, and the southwestern United States for coccidioidomycosis), particularly among those who are immunocompromised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Q fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Q fever is caused by exposure to <em>Coxiella burnetii</em>, a rickettsial agent that infects cows, goats, and sheep. Organisms may be inhaled, ingested, or acquired through tick bites. The disease is characterized by pneumonia with headaches, fever, and myalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As mentioned above, the hepatic granuloma characteristically has a ring of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by lymphocytes and histiocytes (fibrin-ring granuloma). However, fibrin ring granulomas are not diagnostic of Q fever since similar lesions can be seen in patients with other disorders such as hepatitis A, Hodgkin lymphoma, and those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

It is acquired through contact with cattle, goats, or swine, or ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. In addition to fever, other prominent symptoms include sweats, malaise, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, and depression. The onset of symptoms of brucellosis may be abrupt or insidious, developing over several days to weeks. Symptoms can last for months with periods in which patients feel relatively well (hence the name &quot;undulant&quot; fever).</p><p>Patients tend to have a multitude of complaints, often without objective findings except fever. Physical findings, when present, are usually limited to minimal lymphadenopathy and occasionally hepatosplenomegaly.</p><p>Virtually any organ system can be involved with brucellosis, and localization of the process may cause focal symptoms or findings. Four species, <em>Brucella melitensis</em>, <em>B. abortus</em>, <em>B. suis</em>, and <em>B. canis</em>, are known to cause disease in humans. Hepatic granulomas have been best described in patients infected with <em>B. abortus</em> and <em>B. melitensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of brucellosis should be considered in an individual with otherwise unexplained chronic fever and nonspecific complaints. Serum agglutinin titers of &ge;1:320 are considered diagnostic of infection. Such patients should be questioned for possible sources of exposure to Brucella, including contact with animal tissues or ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of brucellosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hodgkin lymphoma, and to a lesser extent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma, have been associated with hepatic granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Lesions are distinct from lymphomatous areas and are not thought to reflect a concomitant infectious etiology.

The exact proportion is unknown but is probably in the range of 10 to 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term &quot;granulomatous hepatitis&quot; refers to a syndrome characterized by a prolonged febrile illness, myalgias, hepatosplenomegaly, and arthralgias of unclear etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Laboratory findings are nonspecific. The sedimentation rate is often markedly elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of symptomatic idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis involves immunosuppression. A concern is that some patients initially diagnosed with granulomatous hepatitis have been subsequently diagnosed with lymphoma, tuberculosis, Q fever, or polymyalgia rheumatica during follow-up. Because immunosuppression in patients with tuberculosis may worsen the disease, it is reasonable to treat initially with an empiric course of antituberculous medications in patients in whom there is a concern about underlying tuberculosis. If there is no clinical response after four to eight weeks, empiric corticosteroids should be instituted, which usually lead to rapid improvement in symptoms and disappearance of the granulomas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroids &ndash; We recommend an initial course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (20 to 40 mg per daily) for treatment of idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis in whom tuberculosis is not suspected. A biochemical response should be noted within several months. Once symptoms have improved, gradual weaning of corticosteroids should be attempted. The prognosis in patients who respond to corticosteroids is good, although relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroids is common and a repeat course of corticosteroids is often necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> &ndash; Methotrexate has been used successfully in patients who did not respond to or refused corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One such report included six patients with idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis in whom methotrexate (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> was associated with resolution in fever and improvement in fatigue and anorexia within three months of beginning therapy. Granulomas resolved in four patients in whom a liver biopsy was repeated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic granulomas are found in approximately 2 to 10 percent of patients who undergo a liver biopsy and may be caused by a variety of conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81043 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56830 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76923 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-granulomas/abstract/4,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,20</a>].

Liver biopsies should be subjected to polarizing light microscopy (occasionally foreign body talc granulomas will be identified) and acid-fast and fungal staining. A thorough diagnostic workup will identify the etiology in most patients.</p><p>The most common causes in the United Sates are sarcoidosis, mycobacterial infection (<em>M. tuberculosis</em> and Mycobacterium avium complex), primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions.
