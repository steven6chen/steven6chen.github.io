However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention.

Irritant contact dermatitis results from exposure to substances that cause physical, mechanical, or chemical irritation of the skin. Irritant contact dermatitis can be caused by common exposures used repeatedly on a daily basis (eg, soapy water, cleansers, rubbing alcohol) and, in some cases, with one exposure (eg, bleach). Individuals with compromised skin (atopic dermatitis, dry skin) and with light-colored or &quot;fair&quot; skin are at a higher risk.

Most patients have manifestations of atopic dermatitis by five to seven years of age. In adults, the flexural areas (neck, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae) are most commonly involved and only in rare cases are lesions seen in the gluteal area. Pruritus, chronic and recurring dermatitis, a positive family history of allergic disease, and an early age of onset of symptoms suggest the diagnosis.

The nodules may rupture, discharging purulent, sometimes malodorous material. Persistent disease leads to the formation of sinus tracts, end-stage &quot;tombstone&quot; comedones, and scarring.

Parasitic infection with <em>Enterobius vermicularis </em>(pinworm) is associated with characteristic nocturnal anal pruritus and is more common in children as compared with adults.

Erythrasma, an infection with <em>Corynebacterium minutissimum,</em> is more common in older adults and patients who are diabetic or immunocompromised. Other risk factors include obesity, hyperhidrosis, and living in tropical climates.

Fecal soilage in patients with anal pruritus may be due to diarrhea or seepage due to an abnormality of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex and a lower threshold for internal anal sphincter relaxation, or transient internal anal sphincter relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anal-pruritus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a case-control study that included 23 men with anal pruritus and 16 controls who underwent anorectal electromyography and manometry, patients with anal pruritus had a greater rise in rectal pressure during internal sphincter relaxation (29 versus 18 mmHg), a greater fall in anal pressure (39 versus 29 mmHg), and a longer duration of internal sphincter relaxation (29 versus 8 seconds) as compared with controls.

In patients with an anorectal fistula, the external opening may be visualized or palpated as induration just below the skin if the external opening is incomplete or blind.

Perianal erythema may be seen in patients with chronic steroid use and candidiasis. Hyperpigmentation of the skin may result from chronic inflammation due to an infection or chronic discharge. The presence of palpable inguinal lymph nodes is suggestive of a neoplasia or sexually transmitted disease. A biopsy of the skin should be performed when a neoplasia is suspected or if the diagnosis is unclear.

In a randomized crossover trial, 44 patients with idiopathic intractable anal pruritus were assigned to topical capsaicin (0.006 percent) or placebo (1 percent menthol) three times daily for four weeks. Treatment with topical capsaicin resulted in an improvement in symptoms in 31 of 44 patients (70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anal-pruritus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among responders to capsaicin, the benefit was either immediate or was evident within three days. The main side effect was a burning sensation upon application, which tended to decrease over time, but caused four patients to drop out of the study. Patients were followed for up to eight months, during which they required approximately one application every other day to minimize or eliminate symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184491877\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other agents have been evaluated in patients with refractory symptoms, but evidence to support their use is limited.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anal tattooing</strong> &ndash; Anal tattooing with intradermal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> has been used to treat patients with refractory symptoms with the rationale that it destroys dermal nerve endings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-anal-pruritus/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

However, most of these patients probably do not come to medical attention. Anal pruritus is more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life and has a higher prevalence in males.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 75 percent of cases of anal pruritus are secondary to inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders that contribute to or underlie the development of pruritus. Idiopathic anal pruritus likely results from perianal fecal contamination and resultant trauma from wiping and scratching. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical assessment of a patient with anal pruritus begins with a history, physical examination, and anoscopy. In patients with systemic symptoms or a change in bowel habits, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or hematochezia, we perform laboratory testing and endoscopic evaluation with a colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest initial management of anal pruritus with conservative treatment and reassurance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This includes improving anal hygiene, avoiding moisture in the anal area, removing offending agents, dietary modification, and protection of the perianal skin with the use of a protective ointment containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a>. In patients with severe pruritus, 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream applied twice daily can relieve symptoms, but should not be used for more than two weeks to avoid skin atrophy. For patients whose symptoms are worse at night, an antihistamine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>) may be helpful until local measures take effect. In addition, in patients with inflammatory, infectious, systemic, neoplastic, and anorectal disorders contributing to anal pruritus, it is important to treat the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with continued symptoms should be carefully reassessed, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have improved or worsened, and compliance with initial management. In addition, we perform laboratory testing and, if not already performed, a colonoscopy. In patients with idiopathic anal pruritus and refractory symptoms, we suggest a trial of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We reserve anal tattooing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> injection for patients who do not respond to topical capsaicin.
