Multiple factors contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory and immunologic factors, plaque rupture, and the traditional risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. The first stage of atherosclerosis begins in childhood with the development of fatty streaks, followed by progression involving the development of fibrous plaques, fibrous caps, and advanced atheromatous lesions.

One of the largest, the Joint Study of Extracranial Arterial Occlusion, evaluated 3788 patients (84 percent of whom were white) with signs and symptoms of ischemic cerebrovascular disease using four vessel angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

These studies probably underestimate the true frequency of intracranial stenosis as a cause of stroke because angiography, the most reliable method for establishing this diagnosis, was only performed in 38 to 75 percent of patients.</p><p>Several studies suggest that intracranial atherosclerosis is more likely to develop in Asians, blacks, and Hispanics than whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,8-10,15-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10,15-24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One population-based study found that the adjusted annual incidence of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke among blacks, Hispanics, and whites was 15, 13, and 3 per 100,000, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 27 white and 24 black patients with symptomatic posterior circulation ischemia, distal basilar artery and intracranial branch lesions were significantly more frequent in blacks, whereas severe extracranial vertebral artery disease was significantly more frequent (fivefold more likely) in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In black patients, stenosis of a major intracranial artery accounts for 15 to 29 percent of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>].

An alternative hypothesis is that racial and ethnic differences in lifestyle and risk factor profiles (eg, higher rates of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia in some populations) play a more important role in determining the distribution of atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/10,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27,28</a>].

There is a narrow window during which this can be accomplished, since the benefit of thrombolysis decreases over time. Thus, an important aspect of the hyperacute phase of stroke assessment and management is the rapid determination of patients who are eligible for thrombolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-thrombolytic-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke-therapeutic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to intravenous thrombolytic therapy, early intra-arterial treatment with mechanical thrombectomy devices is safe and effective for ischemic stroke caused by a proximal anterior circulation large artery occlusion.

In most cases, the diagnosis is made using noninvasive methods (ie, MRA, CTA, and TCD) because they are safer and more easily obtained than gold-standard conventional angiography. Conventional angiography is still used to confirm the presence of intracranial stenosis or to investigate an alternative etiology such as moyamoya disease, intracranial dissection, and vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive neurovascular imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive tests to identify intracranial atherosclerosis such as TCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>], MRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>], and CTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>] are in widespread use. These procedures are less expensive, less invasive, and more widely available than catheter angiography for evaluating the intracranial circulation. All of these noninvasive modalities are useful for excluding moderate to severe (50 to 99 percent) stenosis of large proximal intracranial arteries.</p><p>Noninvasive imaging methods do have certain limitations related to accuracy and sensitivity when compared with the gold standard of catheter angiography. However, in clinical practice, the added information from catheter angiography is unlikely to alter management. As examples, noninvasive methods may not be sufficiently accurate to differentiate an occlusion from pseudo-occlusion with critical stenosis. In addition, they are not accurate enough to confirm the severity of a clinically significant stenosis and tend to overestimate the severity of stenosis. In the prospective multicenter SONIA trial, both TCD and MRA had high negative predictive values (86 and 91 percent) and low positive predictive values (36 and 59 percent) for the detection of intracranial stenosis compared with catheter angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Similarly, a subsequent report from SONIA found that CTA had a good negative predictive value (73 percent) and a low positive predictive value (47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Nevertheless, intensive medical therapy is indicated for patients with a first event related to symptomatic intracranial large artery stenosis detected by noninvasive imaging (see <a href=\"#H780033812\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below); more precise characterization of the stenosis with catheter angiography would not affect the initial management in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387616548\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter angiography is unnecessary for the vast majority of cases with suspected intracranial large artery atherosclerosis since it will seldom alter clinical management. Angiography enables an accurate measurement of the degree of stenosis of the diseased artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], differentiation of arterial occlusion from a very severe stenosis, assessment of collateral flow patterns, and evaluation of other intracranial and extracranial arteries. Thus, conventional angiography may be needed in some cases to confirm the presence of intracranial stenosis or to investigate an alternative etiology such as moyamoya disease, intracranial dissection, and vasculitis.</p><p>The major drawback of angiography is the risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], which was as high as 1.2 percent in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780035907\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of intracranial atherosclerosis includes other causes of intracranial artery stenosis such as arterial dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, cerebral vasoconstriction, primary or secondary vasculitis, moyamoya disease, and other vasculopathies. These conditions are less common than atherosclerotic disease among adult populations with vascular risk factors, and clinical or radiologic features can help to distinguish them from atherosclerosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection is suspected when angiography demonstrates a string sign, a tapered stenosis or occlusion, a flame-shaped occlusion, an intimal flap, a dissecting aneurysm, or a distal pouch. Fat-saturated MRI sequences may show an intramural hematoma. Dissection of intracranial arteries is far less frequent than dissection of extracranial cervical arteries.

Less commonly, there is involvement of the external carotid artery and the larger intracranial arteries (the middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, basilar, and anterior communicating arteries). The most common manifestations are hypertension, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, transient ischemic attack, and stroke, but other manifestations may occur, depending upon the arterial segment involved and the severity of disease.

However, analyses of the SAMMPRIS trial found no benefit for stenting for any subgroup of patients, including those patients with a prior ischemic stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/68,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial bypass surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While intracranial bypass surgery is a therapeutic option for patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, enthusiasm for bypass waned after the extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass study results were reported in 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. In that study, 1377 patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid occlusion, distal carotid occlusive disease, or middle cerebral arteries (MCA) stenosis were randomly assigned to either medical therapy alone (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in four divided doses) or to extracranial-intracranial anastomosis surgery (joining the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery) combined with medical therapy.

Similar rates are suggested by prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/62,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,95</a>], as illustrated by findings in a randomized controlled trial (WASID) that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in 569 patients with symptomatic stenosis (50 to 99 percent) of a major intracranial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In both treatment groups, the ischemic stroke rate in the territory of the stenotic artery at one year was 11 to 12 percent. These stroke rates are likely lower with the advent of intensive medical therapy (ie, dual antiplatelet therapy for three months followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive, and high-intensity statin treatment), as suggested by stroke rates among medically treated subjects in the SAMMPRIS and VISSIT trials. (See <a href=\"#H458998876\" class=\"local\">'Stenting'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis, subsequent strokes are usually nonlacunar infarcts in the territory of the symptomatic artery and a high proportion are disabling. Over a mean 1.8 years of follow-up in the WASID cohort, there were 106 ischemic strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Stroke occurred in the territory of the symptomatic artery in 77 patients (73 percent). Among the 77 in-territory strokes, 70 (91 percent) were nonlacunar and 34 (44 percent) were disabling.</p><p>Although the issue is not settled, there may be subgroups of patients with intracranial atherosclerosis who are at particularly high risk of stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe intracranial large artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

In addition, women had a higher risk of recurrent ischemic stroke than men (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.14-3.01).</p><p/><p>In the medical treatment arm of the SAMMPRIS trial, which enrolled patients with ischemic stroke or TIA attributed to severe (70 to 99 percent) stenosis of a major intracranial artery, high risk features for recurrent stroke were the presence of an old infarct in the territory of the stenosis, presentation with stroke, and absence of statin use at trial entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Earlier retrospective studies suggested that high-risk groups also included patients with vertebrobasilar disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>], and those who developed recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events or died despite the use of antithrombotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. However, the prospective WASID trial found no increased stroke risk associated with vertebrobasilar disease (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.66-1.68) or use of antithrombotic therapy at the time of the qualifying ischemic event (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.66-1.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>Intracranial stenosis considered &quot;hemodynamically significant&quot; purely on clinical grounds emerged as another potential risk factor for recurrent ischemic stroke in the GESICA study, a prospective observational report that enrolled 102 patients with &ge;50 percent symptomatic intracranial large artery atherosclerotic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Intracranial stenosis was classified as hemodynamic in GESICA if symptoms related to the stenosis occurred during a change in body position from supine to prone, during <span class=\"nowrap\">effort/exertion,</span> or with the introduction or increase of antihypertensive medication. Patients with a hemodynamic stenosis had a significantly higher frequency of recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the territory of the stenotic artery than those without a hemodynamic stenosis (61 versus 32 percent). In contrast, among patients in the SAMMPRIS trial with a 70 to 99 percent stenosis who had qualifying symptoms suggestive of hypoperfusion (same definition as above) and were assigned to the aggressive medical management group (n = 31), the two-year probability of an outcome event (ie, 30-day stroke and death and later strokes in the territory of the qualifying artery) was only 7 percent (95% CI 1.8-25.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>The observational VERITAS study analyzed hemodynamics for 72 patients with recent posterior circulation TIA or stroke and &gt;50 percent atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the vertebral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basilar arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Low blood flow in these vessels, as determined by quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), was associated with an increased risk for subsequent vertebrobasilar stroke (adjusted HR 11.55, 95% CI 1.88-71.00). Studies are underway to determine if low flow on quantitative MRA has predictive capability in anterior circulation stenosis.
