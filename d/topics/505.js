The airway anastomosis has traditionally been the most vulnerable site for operative complications of lung transplantation. Airway anastomotic complications include focal infection, bronchial necrosis and dehiscence, excess granulation tissue, tracheobronchomalacia, stenosis, and fistula formation.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of airway anastomotic complications of lung transplantation will be reviewed here. Other airway complications, such as bacterial and viral tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis obliterans, and noninfectious problems related to lung transplantation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial infections following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications following lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES AND DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anastomotic airway complications after lung transplantation include those that typically develop within the first month (eg, anastomotic infection, necrosis, or dehiscence) and those that develop later (eg, excess granulation tissue, bronchomalacia, airway stenosis, bronchopleural fistula, bronchomediastinal fistula, or bronchovascular fistula) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70902 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Limited mucosal necrosis and sloughing at the anastomotic site are commonly observed during bronchoscopy in the first two to three weeks after transplant. These mild mucosal changes are not usually considered an &quot;airway complication,&quot; if satisfactory healing occurs without intervention. Complications are considered significant when they necessitate an intervention such as debridement, dilatation, or stent placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND IMPACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported incidences of airway anastomotic complications range from 2 to 33 percent, although most centers have rates in the range of 7 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In a retrospective series of 232 lung transplants, 57 airway complications developed; the majority occurred in the first post-transplant year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although airway complications lead to increased costs, greater morbidity, and decreased quality of life, they are generally not associated with a substantial decrease in survival. In a series of 983 lung transplants, the hospital mortality of those with an airway complication was 10 versus 9.7 percent for those without an anastomotic complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major reason for the high rate of complications at the bronchial anastomotic site is believed to be the loss of systemic blood supply to that site during transplantation. The normal bronchial blood supply is interrupted during the lung harvest procedure, leaving the bronchial vessels at the anastomotic site dependent on retrograde filling from the pulmonary arterial circulation through communications with pulmonary capillaries and precapillary anastomoses in the submucosal plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>].</p><p>Revascularization of the donor bronchus usually takes two to four weeks. This process may be more successful when the donor bronchus is shortened to within one to two cartilaginous rings of the take-off of the upper lobe bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While revascularization is occurring, the anastomotic site is subject to ischemic conditions and may develop varying degrees of necrosis and dehiscence. In some patients, the healing process of these areas of necrosis leads to development of granulation tissue and subsequent airway stenosis.</p><p>The surgical anastomotic technique may be a factor in the development of airway complications. The original technique of using an omentopexy (surrounding the anastomosis with a piece of omentum) was associated with a high rate of dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Subsequent techniques have used a simple buttressing of the anastomosis with peribronchial tissues, which has decreased the rate of dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>An aspect of the anastomotic technique that remains controversial is telescoping the anastomosis by preferentially intussuscepting the recipient bronchus into that of the donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This technique may reduce early dehiscence, but may lead to increased rates of bronchial stenosis months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. We typically use the end-to-end anastomotic technique and reserve the telescoping anastomotic technique for situations where there is a size discrepancy between the donor and recipient bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors are associated with an increased risk of anastomotic airway complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe reperfusion edema (primary graft dysfunction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute rejection within the first post-transplant year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre and postoperative pulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative Pseudomonas cepacia colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> prior to complete anastomotic healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Current doses of glucocorticoids used to suppress rejection are not felt to increase the risk of airway complications following lung transplantation, despite their adverse effects on wound healing in general.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform surveillance bronchoscopy with inspection of the anastomotic site at two weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>].

Bronchial stenosis usually manifests after the first posttransplant month, but sometimes not until years after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchial stenosis can be asymptomatic and diagnosed as an incidental finding during surveillance bronchoscopy, or it may present with dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, deteriorating pulmonary function tests, or postobstructive pneumonia. When presenting years after transplantation, the stenosis can cause progressive, often debilitating airflow obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of bronchial stenosis is based upon bronchoscopic visualization. Computed tomography (CT), performed with multiplanar reconstruction of the bronchial tree or virtual bronchoscopy, is typically done to provide additional information regarding the exact location and length of the bronchial or anastomotic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

However, interpretation of spirometric results may be difficult in the setting of single lung transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as airflow obstruction may reflect the diseased native lung. Inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curves help to distinguish between airflow obstruction caused by bronchial stenosis and that caused by bronchomalacia or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Bronchial stenosis typically results in a pattern of fixed airflow limitation during both inspiration and expiration, while bronchomalacia has variable obstruction worse on expiration than inspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77738\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77738 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;, section on 'Variable intrathoracic obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;, section on 'Mainstem bronchial obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-changes-following-lung-transplantation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic changes following lung transplantation&quot;, section on 'Spirometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Vanishing bronchus intermedius</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several cases have been reported of bronchial stenosis in the bronchus intermedius, distal to the anastomotic site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This type of stenosis is known as the vanishing bronchus intermedius syndrome. The time of diagnosis is usually between two and six months posttransplant, but may be as late as 12 months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Ischemic injury is believed to be the inciting factor, as ischemic changes in this area are often visible on posttransplant bronchoscopy. However, acute cellular rejection may also contribute.</p><p>The diagnosis is typically made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Right middle and lower lobe collapse may be visible on chest radiography. A chest CT scan may be helpful to delineate the length of the obstruction. This type of bronchial stenosis is associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Management is similar to that for anastomotic stenosis, as described below, although it is difficult to keep a stent in the correct position without occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild, asymptomatic bronchial stenosis (less than 50 percent of the bronchial diameter) can be managed conservatively with observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For more severe, symptomatic bronchial stenosis (usually greater than 50 percent of bronchial diameter), bronchoscopic dilation is the initial and preferred treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Alternative measures for refractory stenosis include laser or cryosurgery, placement of an endobronchial stent, sleeve resection of the stenotic area, lobectomy, and retransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These choices are described further in the following paragraphs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endobronchial dilation</strong> &ndash; Endobronchial dilation is usually accomplished with a rigid or a flexible bronchoscope using balloon dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/12,20,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,24-26</a>]. In a series of 17 patients with moderate to severe bronchial stenosis after lung transplant, 14 patients were managed successfully with airway dilation via flexible or rigid bronchoscopy, while two required pneumonectomy and one retransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the pediatric population, the balloon technique was found to be better for dilation, than using the rigid bronchoscope itself for dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If stenosis recurs, dilation is usually repeated as this is often successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Silicone stents are generally preferred over metallic stents because they are easily removable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a series of 27 lung transplant recipients, silicone stents were placed in 32 stenotic airway lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Stents were left in place for a median of 6 months (range 1 to 22 months). Occasionally, inspissated secretions in the stents required bronchoscopic removal. Formation of granulation tissue at either end of the stent was common, but rarely required additional intervention and typically resolved after stent removal. Silicone stents are usually left in place until the airway appears healed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative stents, such as removable nitinol stents, are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

This predisposition is probably related to immunosuppression, poor vascular supply, and impaired clearance of secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial infections. Aspergillus colonizes the airways of approximately 20 percent of lung transplant recipients in the immediate postoperative period and may become invasive in 3 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].
