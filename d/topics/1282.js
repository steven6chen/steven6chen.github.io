Medical care for acute or chronic conditions is the principal reason, but patients also request clinicians' advice about maintaining their health, good nutrition, exercise programs, and other strategies to prevent disease. Near the end of life, patients may seek clinicians' advice on withdrawing from cure-oriented interventions, emphasizing the need for comfort and control of symptoms instead. Finally, people come to clinicians for their role as &quot;social managers,&quot; seeking assistance in accessing social goods and services (eg, disability benefits, housing benefits, workers' compensation, &quot;permission&quot; to return to work, and clearance to participate in athletic activities). Responding to such diverse needs and requests is a substantial challenge.</p><p>As we consider the approach to the &quot;patient,&quot; we will focus upon the knowledge, skills, and values that foster effective professional connections with the <strong>people</strong> who enter clinicians' offices seeking care, some of whom may be sick <strong>patients</strong>. This topic provides an overview of the approach to the patient, for the satisfaction of the patient and the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186684116\"><span class=\"h1\">ESSENTIAL TASKS OF THE CONTEMPORARY CLINICIAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are six essential tasks of the contemporary clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53207 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Knowledge base and personal strategies to keep up </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Today's clinicians have at their disposal a vast and rapidly-growing body of biomedical and psychosocial knowledge. The understanding and appropriate application of this knowledge is a foundation for effective medical care. Two principal tasks of clinicians are to master the knowledge pertinent to their field of medicine and to develop personal strategies to learn continuously and manage the enormous body of information that will continue to evolve throughout their careers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Connecting with patients </strong>&ndash; The appropriate application of biomedical and psychosocial knowledge requires a contextual understanding of each individual who seeks medical care. This in turn requires the ability to communicate effectively with each patient, mindful of the importance of the person's cultural background. Unfortunately, improvements in communication between clinicians and patients, which would require designated time prioritized to effectively interview patients and understand their needs, has not kept pace with technological advances in medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinicians must build and sustain trustworthy relationships in order to hear and grasp patient concerns, elicit their requests, negotiate diagnostic and treatment strategies, teach them about their health or illness, check on adherence to treatment plans, and assess the outcomes of interventions. Thus, the third principal task of clinicians is to heed the admonition of E.M. Forster: &quot;always connect&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maximizing cost-effectiveness</strong> &ndash; Societies can rightly demand that the medical profession provide its services in an accountable and cost-effective fashion. A 2010 estimate suggested that, in the United States for example, approximately 30 percent of health care costs, or more than $700 billion per year, is wasted, is potentially avoidable, and would not negatively affect quality of care if eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Numerous organizational models of health care delivery aim to take advantage of economies of scale and integration. Many provide great opportunities to improve the health of individuals and of populations by better coordination of all aspects of medical care and by assessing and responding to each individual's health risks. The need for connection between patient and a specific clinician remains strong, whatever the organizational structure of care delivery. In one study of patients receiving primary care among 13 practices, the most important determinant of whether a patient received appropriate preventive health measures was whether they were connected to a specific clinician rather than to just a clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Understanding the system </strong>&ndash; Clinicians must understand the &quot;systems&quot; in which and with which they practice medicine; practice in ways that demonstrate accountability for both the quality and the cost of the care they provide; and teach their patients how to use these systems effectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53207\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53207 \">table 1</a>). These three essential tasks are new competencies for clinicians. Clinicians have been slow to recognize the importance of understanding the structures, forces, incentives, and dynamic equilibria of the organizations in which they work. Systems thinking is central to the provision of high-quality care by large networks of providers. It involves philosophical appreciation that clinicians do not work alone for their patients, but rather in teams. It also requires procedural knowledge of &quot;how to get things done in this system&quot; and a capacity to collaborate with other stakeholders to bring about systems change where there are impediments to effective care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Effective systems thinking about medical care requires understanding the human, technological, and financial resources available within the system and an ethic surrounding resource distribution. Inherent in ethical systems of health care delivery is accountability both for the quality of the care delivered to individuals and for the cost of the care, assuring appropriate distribution of resources to all persons within the population served by the system. Any system is only as strong as its weakest component (technological, informational, financial, or human). Hence, good systems thinking also appreciates that the functioning and the outputs of the system must be continuously monitored and improved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A crucial component of the health care system is the people who work in it. Changes in health care delivery are increasing the importance of interprofessional communication and collaboration. Clinicians join allied health providers (eg, nurses, pharmacists, clinician assistants, occupational and physical therapists, social workers, case managers, medical assistants, clinical support staff) and administrators on teams to assure that services are tailored to meet individual health care needs effectively and efficiently. This requires that everyone on the team appreciates each other's roles, abilities, and limitations, that everyone appreciates the extent of resources available to care for the patient, and that good mechanisms of communication effectively link team members. Good communications are enhanced when team members create real professional relationships that extend well beyond the exchange of order forms and consultation reports. The size and complexity of teams will vary with the needs of different patient populations and practice sites. Some may be &quot;virtual teams,&quot; connected electronically. It is probable that even on these teams, effectiveness and accountability is greatly enhanced when personal relationships lie behind the electronic exchanges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Educating and supporting patients in the optimal use of the system</strong> &ndash; Responsible stewardship for health care resources in large health care delivery systems is not simply a matter of producing services at the least cost. Stewardship requires that human relationships be highly valued in all choices. It is within individual human relationships that patients can feel sufficient safety and trust to disclose their fears, symptoms, concerns, and preferences about their health. Creating these relationships, wherein patients feel heard, acknowledged, and understood, can be healing in itself. Furthermore, individual relationships foster professional satisfaction and pride for members of the health care team. All relationships matter, including clinician-patient, patient-unit secretary, primary care clinician-subspecialty consultant, patient-case manager, etc.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinicians must recognize the importance of managing the care of patients within a system so as to maximize quality and cost-effectiveness of the care delivered to their patients. A substantial portion of a patient's confidence in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> clinician will depend upon the clinician's skill and capacity to access and unfold the best aspects of the system for the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The trust forged in the initial clinician-patient relationship is often the key to a patient's willingness to participate in, and benefit from, care provided by members of a clinical team other than the clinician. Willingness to forego unnecessary and costly medical services is only present within a trusting clinician-patient relationship. In the final analysis, all systems of care are founded upon the capacity of the clinician to establish and sustain an effective relationship, first created in the context of a clinical visit.</p><p/><p>The clinician has numerous tasks during the patient visit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51924\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51924 \">table 2</a>). This extensive work needs to be accomplished with every patient but fortunately not on every visit. The abstract list comes to life when it is appreciated as the work performed in a skillfully guided conversation, or series of conversations, between two people within a professional relationship. It is colored by the feelings and life experiences of both parties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The methods applied must be tailored to the situation at hand, differing somewhat in the emergency department, consultant's office, and primary care office. In all settings, however, there are some consistent truths about medical encounters: all people are anxious to some extent when they come to see a clinician; all people desire and deserve to be treated with respect; all people want to be heard and understood by their clinicians; and almost all people expect to be professionally touched by their clinicians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONS OF THE MEDICAL INTERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical interview is the medium through which the patient&rsquo;s needs and requests are made known, the human connections are established, and almost all the work of doctoring is conducted. Many diagnoses can be made based on the patient&rsquo;s history alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Three functions of the medical interview have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65802 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data-gathering</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationship-building</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education</p><p/><p>The three functions of the interview are interwoven throughout the dialogue of the clinician and patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Data-gathering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data-gathering enables the clinician to establish a diagnosis or recommend further diagnostic procedures, suggest courses of treatment, and predict the nature of the illness. The tasks of this function are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquire the appropriate knowledge base of diseases and disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquire the knowledge base of psychosocial issues that contribute to the patient's illness behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bring the data that have been elicited into focus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generate and test multiple hypotheses during the course of the interview</p><p/><p>The verbal skills that facilitate accomplishing these tasks include asking open-ended questions (and waiting for the answers); active listening; making facilitative utterances (&quot;uh-huh, tell me more&hellip; yes&hellip; go on&hellip;&quot;); making orienting remarks (&quot;I will ask you about x, and then we will do y&hellip;&quot;); asking focusing questions when needed (&quot;Where was the pain? What made it worse?&quot;); eliciting and prioritizing the patient's agenda for the visit (&quot;What should we be certain to get done today?&quot;); checking for understanding; and summarizing what the clinician has heard (&quot;Let me be sure I have this right. You felt fine until you started shoveling snow, then you felt dizzy and thought you might faint,&quot; etc) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76848 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The nonverbal skills that facilitate good data collection start with &quot;clearing the clinician's mental and physical slate&quot; before entering the room with the patient. Important and often neglected nonverbal skills also include being aware of and consciously shaping how the clinician's appearance, body language, voice qualities (eg, tone, volume, pace), and the spatial arrangements of furniture and people in the room affect the interactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50644 \">table 5</a>). As health care providers increasingly use electronic medical records (EMRs), they must master the skills needed to use the computer to assist effective data-gathering and -sharing and the skills needed to avoid allowing the computer to become a barrier between the patient and the provider (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F109194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109194 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship-building</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relationship-building seeks to ensure the patient's willingness to provide diagnostic and other important information, to relieve the patient's physical and psychosocial distress, to ensure the patient's willingness to accept the treatment plan or a process of negotiation, and to ensure both the patient's and clinician's satisfaction with work well-done. The tasks of this function are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Define the nature of the relationship</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicate professional expertise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicate interest, respect, support, and empathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognize and resolve various relational barriers to <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/clinician</span> communication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elicit the patient's perspective</p><p/><p>The skills of effective relationship building are both verbal and nonverbal. The power and importance of nonverbal communication cannot be overstated. Consider, for example, the effect of nonverbal empathy when the clinician gently touches the shoulder of the newly widowed woman. All behavior is communication. Patients are reading nonverbal messages from clinicians consciously or unconsciously throughout each visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Does the clinician lean towards or away from the patient? Is there appropriate eye contact and head nodding to indicate listening? The clinician and patient assess whether the unspoken messages match the words. When they match, the veracity of the words is likely. A mismatch suggests need for some explicit checking (eg, patient says &quot;OK, I'll fill the prescription&quot; but looks absently out the window). The skillful clinician is consciously monitoring and controlling <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own nonverbal messages to the patient while reading the nonverbal communication from the patient.</p><p>The skillful clinician is also evaluating <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own thoughts and emotions and how these affect verbal and nonverbal responses to the patient and even influence clinical judgment. Is a growing sense of irritation in the clinician during an interview related to actions of the patient, or unrelated issues (eg, that second cup of coffee, air conditioning problems, or a disagreement at home the previous night?). Awareness of the effects of our own mental processes on our relationships with patients is often referred to as &quot;mindful practice&quot; and has been described as &quot;cultivation of the observing self in the midst of the complexity and chaos of everyday work&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Through mindful practice, clinicians improve their attention and ability to sense subtleties, reduce bias and premature categorization, and enhance openness to new ideas and actions.</p><p>The appropriate use of language is also a crucial aspect of relationship building. Both what is said and how it is said are important. Verbal relationship building skills include statements of partnership, empathy, apology, respect, legitimation, and support (PEARLS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64050 \">table 6</a>). Empathy is most easily conveyed by the use of reflection. Communication of understanding of emotion through reflective statements such as &quot;that was tough for you&quot; or even &quot;gosh!&quot; can deepen the therapeutic relationship and improve patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Legitimation refers to voicing acceptance or validation of the emotions or reactions of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A simple &quot;I'd be upset by that too&quot; can be reassuring to an anxious or angry patient and turn a difficult encounter into a productive one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education seeks to ensure the patient's understanding of the illness, to suggest diagnostic procedures and treatment possibilities, to foster consensus between clinician and patient, and to create a firm foundation for informed consent, improved coping mechanisms, and the promotion of healthy lifestyle change. Providing appropriate patient education to foster consensus and allow full informed consent is one way that clinicians show respect for their patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The tasks of this function are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the areas of differences (potential conflict) between the clinician and patient, and promote negotiation to resolve the differences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicate about the diagnostic significance of the problem(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommend the appropriate diagnostic procedures and treatment, including appropriate preventive measures and lifestyle changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhance coping ability by understanding and working with the social and psychosocial consequences of the disease and treatment</p><p/><p>The skills of patient education involve asking questions to discover what the patient knows about the illness, how <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> feels about it, what <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> believes about it, what meanings <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> attaches to it, and what <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> expects to happen because of the illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its treatment. The two keys to successful patient education are the use of comprehensible language and avoidance of &quot;too much, too soon, too fast.&quot;</p><p>The skillful clinician's questions probe the patient's &quot;need to know&quot; in each of these areas. <span class=\"nowrap\">S/he</span> then calibrates responses in both content and tone to exactly what the patient wants to know. If the clinician senses resistance to learning about something that is important from <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> perspective, this resistance must be explored. Invariably, such an exploration will uncover important patient concerns, fears, prior adverse experience, or serious misunderstanding of what the clinician is saying. In summary, the content of effective patient education rests upon the clinician's knowledge, but that is not enough. Its implementation requires an open, trusting clinician-patient relationship. Patient education is best accomplished in a true conversation between clinician and patient, not through a clinician monologue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63604 \">table 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTIVE CLINICIAN STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four general categories of clinician behaviors lead to effective patient care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54037\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54037 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive strategies (knowledge-related)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affective strategies (emotion-related)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral change strategies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social strategies (invoking group mechanisms beyond the individual)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effective clinician negotiates patient priorities and expectations explicitly at the beginning of the relationship, as well as at subsequent critical junctures of decision making. <span class=\"nowrap\">S/he</span> gives a complete explanation of the patient's condition and treatment options, encouraging questions that expand the patient's understanding. Through this dialogue, the clinician brings the patient to a &quot;decision crossroads&quot; at which <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> is ready to make informed choices about treatment. The clinician also educates the patient about difficulties <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> might have with <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> condition or its management, and offers a prognosis of what may be expected to happen.</p><p>Cognitive strategies that the cost-conscious clinician employs prior to recommending specific diagnostic testing or treatments include asking the questions: Why order this test or treatment? What makes it appropriate and cost-effective in this patient's care? What will I do with the test results? Will the test results affect my management of this patient's care? [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Affective strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effective clinician conveys <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> genuine empathy for the patient in many ways. These include facilitating full expression of the emotional content of the patient's experience, providing encouragement and reassurance when needed and suitable, touching the patient appropriately; and taking actions that sustain hope. The clinician also facilitates patient self-forgiveness, in anticipation of or after failure in the face of a challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral change strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effective clinician discovers a patient's readiness to change any particular unhealthy behavior. One group has described stages of behavior change as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and then either maintenance of the new, healthier behavior or relapse into the old, unhealthy behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Understanding the patient's readiness to change and then matching the clinician's strategy to that stage may lead to successful change efforts.</p><p>Patients in precontemplation may need to hear clearly from the clinician that the behavior is likely to have unhealthy consequences. Others may be aware of the consequences but need a supportive and nonjudgmental atmosphere in which to wrestle with their ambivalence about behavior change.</p><p>Patients in contemplation often need help from the clinician to explore the pros and cons of continuing versus stopping the unhealthy behavior. Exploring the pros of the unhealthy behavior (eg &quot;What do you like about smoking?&quot;) as an initial step can often reduce defensiveness and open conversation. Reviewing past attempts at change may be helpful. Emphasis should be placed on past successes (&quot;You were able to quit for an entire week!&quot;), leading to increased self-efficacy and hope.</p><p>Patients in preparation may need the clinician's help in planning a specific behavior change strategy, and patients in action may benefit from the prescription of specific treatments that can support the change (eg, alternative nicotine delivery systems to aid in smoking cessation). The clinician must explain clearly the goals of any specific treatment and the means of achieving them, emphasizing the benefits and necessity of the patient's active participation in the program of care. <span class=\"nowrap\">S/he</span> provides regular, positive feedback for patient adherence to the program and, when needed, suggests alternative courses if the original path proves impossible.</p><p>Motivational Interviewing is a patient counseling method for encouraging behavioral changes to improve health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While motivational interviewing is most associated with substance use disorders (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;</a>), and is often used in counseling patients regarding alcohol and tobacco use, meta-analyses have indicated effectiveness in medical care settings for a range of important outcome measures including blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], cholesterol level, sedentary behavior, body weight, HIV viral load, patient confidence, intention to change, engagement in treatment, and even death rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Combining the active ingredients of a supportive relationship and a conversation that promotes positive change statements, motivational interviewing may be a useful strategy for a number of common problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Social strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all of these activities, when appropriate, the effective clinician employs social group strategies to improve health outcomes. These include obtaining permission from the patient to inform and involve family members in the patient's care, as well as collaboration with appropriate community organizations. The clinician explicitly creates coherent teamwork for patient care, sharing information about <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own care activities with other members of the health professions team.</p><p>The first decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century are seeing social strategies to improve health and healthcare adopted as a new &quot;way of doing business&quot; by many leading academic and community hospitals. Referred to as &quot;patient- and family-centered care,&quot; this approach brings thoughtful patients and family members into the administrative decision-making practices of hospitals and office practices. Patients and family members offer their insights into how health care delivery can be made more &quot;user-friendly&quot; and efficient. The four core concepts of patient- and family-centered care are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dignity and Respect &ndash; Listen to and honor patient and family perspectives and choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information Sharing &ndash; Communicate and share complete information with patients and families in ways that are affirming and useful</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation &ndash; Patients and families are encouraged and supported in participating in care and decision making at the level they choose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collaboration &ndash; Patients, families, and health care practitioners and leaders collaborate in policy and program development, implementation and evaluation, facility design, and professional education as well as in delivery of care</p><p/><p>The potential for patient- and family-centered care to improve patient safety and satisfaction, the cost of care, and provider satisfaction is substantial and is becoming an important research topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DESIRABLE CLINICIAN BEHAVIORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients' descriptions of desirable clinician behaviors can be grouped into three major dimensions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52737\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52737 \">table 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behaviors expected of clinicians because they are professionals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinician behaviors understood by patients to be respectful</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinician behaviors understood by patients to be supportive</p><p/><p>Patients expect clinicians to groom and dress appropriately, minimize frustrations from prior visits with other patients that carry over into subsequent visits, be punctual, treat them like an equal, engage in the courteous behaviors expected among equals (eg, shaking hands, calling patients by the names they prefer, sitting down with them, etc), and engage in activities that establish a relaxed atmosphere in spite of patients' anxiety. These help to get the visit off to the right start.</p><p>Clinicians should prepare in advance for the visit, minimize interruptions during the visit, listen actively and seek to understand fully the patient's illness history, explain elements of the physical examination as it proceeds, take all the patient's complaints seriously even if they are not medically plausible, and express concern for the effects of the illness in the patient's daily life. Critical professional behaviors when talking about a diagnosis and its possible therapy include clear and complete explanations of the problem and treatment, and the clinician's knowing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own limitations, referring when necessary for consultation.</p><p>Respectful clinician behaviors when talking about a problem and its treatment include involving the patient in making treatment choices and being honest under all circumstances. Supportive actions on the part of the clinician include taking time to talk no matter how busy and encouraging patient and family questions. In follow-up activities, the clinician provides the patient with ready access to care, including cross-coverage when <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> is away, and follows through on all promises made to the patient. The respectful clinician involves the patient in management and is conscious of the financial implications of the patient's illness. Finally, the supportive clinician remains active in helping patients throughout the process by connecting them with additional resources, being available between appointments, and, when possible and appropriate, checking on them at home.</p><p>The overarching task for clinicians is to appreciate and act upon patient preferences for better integrated conversations in medical visits and for greater attention to psychosocial issues and affect-loaded problems. The ultimate challenge is not a cognitive one, but a behavioral one: to stay in close touch with the clinician's own humanity, no matter how harried the day, and to connect with the patient.</p><p>This behavioral task of making a good connection with each patient must be realistically considered within the context of time-limited office and hospital visits. Research demonstrates that expressly attending to affect-loaded problems can in fact improve efficiency as well as improve patient and provider satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approaches that have been proven to save time include allowing patients to offer and finish their opening statements, negotiating a consensually prioritized agenda for the visit, responding to patients' reactions and concerns with empathy, and offering patients orientation to the events of the visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The &quot;Four Habits Approach&quot; to clinical communication provides a useful and well-validated summary of clinician behaviors during a medical visit that have proven to be effective for both the patient and clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69929\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69929 \">table 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROFESSIONAL VALUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dr. Francis W. Peabody's often-quoted address on &quot;The Care of the Patient&quot; speaks eloquently to the value of clinicians' respect for humanity and the value of the clinician-patient relationship to treatment itself. &quot;The significance of the intimate personal relationship between clinician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both the diagnosis and the treatment are directly dependent on it. One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care of the patient is caring for the patient&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Carl Rogers studied and taught about the beneficial outcomes for learning and health that result from approaching a <span class=\"nowrap\">learner/patient</span> with unconditional positive regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The American Board of Internal Medicine has placed increasing importance on humanistic qualities as it considers candidates for its examination. It requires program directors to evaluate residents' personal integrity and their respect and compassion for patients. The Pew-Fetzer Task Force on Advancing Psychosocial Health Education carefully considers areas of knowledge, skills, and values that support effective patient-practitioner relationships (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71179 \">table 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They emphasize the following values: importance of self-awareness, self-care, and self-growth; appreciation of the patient's life story and the meaning of the health-illness condition; respect for the patient's dignity, uniqueness, and integrity (mind-body-spirit unity); respect for self-determination; respect for a person's own power and self-healing processes; and the importance of being open and nonjudgmental.</p><p>In addition to the above observations, we would highlight the importance of ascribing value to several other features of clinician-patient interactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical curiosity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to decision-making preferences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to cultural issues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to accountability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to professionalism</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical curiosity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respectful curiosity about the person in front of you and about medicine brings energy, vitality, salience, and meaningfulness to medical visits. It is healthy for the encounter and critically important to the sustenance of the clinician's dedication to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Explicit attention to decision-making preferences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients vary in the degree to which they want to share in medical decision-making. Many older patients prefer the clinician to hold most of the authority, while younger patients are apt to want to play an active role in shaping diagnostic and therapeutic plans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. No rules hold, however, so the operative value needs to be one of respecting each individual's preference for the extent to which decision-making is shared, and the operative behavior must be to check explicitly about that preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Attention to cultural issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have alluded to the importance of knowledge about cultural differences between patients and clinicians. For this knowledge to be of real use, to effect medical outcomes of care, the clinician must move beyond cognition of cultural differences to truly valuing and respecting the beliefs of each patient to whom <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> provides care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cross-cultural-care-and-communication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cross-cultural care and communication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Attention to accountability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of medical training inculcates clinicians with a strong sense of responsibility. &quot;The buck stops here&quot; is a feeling well known by every intern. While this can greatly benefit patients when the clinician is personally executing every aspect of care, that is now rarely the case. It is not an effective point of view when the clinician is part of a team. Clinician arrogance about &quot;who knows best&quot; is unfortunately another well-known phenomenon. The clinician must hold responsibility for <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> part in the team's work but must also appreciate each team member's role and skills. All team members are responsible for respectful collaboration in the work and participation in a system that monitors outcomes of care and provides clear and timely feedback about each team member's performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Attention to professionalism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective interactions between each clinician and patient depend, at their core, on mutual trust. Survey data show that the levels of trust and respect that were formerly extended to the profession of medicine have substantially eroded over the past 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Societal skepticism about the trustworthiness of medicine has many legitimate sources and is a cause for concern.</p><p>What can we do to restore the public's trust in our chosen profession? While there is no straightforward solution, we can begin by being aware of this challenging situation and mindful of the foundational values that can guide our behavior with each patient we approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81986 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We must learn to use and balance our values when navigating particularly difficult situations with patients (eg, breaking bad news, withholding an unnecessary and costly <span class=\"nowrap\">technology/test)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We must openly reveal to our patients (and students) the basis for the professional judgments we are making.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We must actively take patients' preferences into consideration and be prepared to change our opinions when new information becomes available, including the basis for patients' opinions.</p><p/><p>Only by making this &quot;juggling act&quot; explicit will we regain trust and avoid perpetuating some of the most damaging situations of all, ones in which we contribute to racial, ethnic, and other disparities through our implicit processes of stereotyping and misperceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINUOUS LEARNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As Hippocrates observed, art is long and life is short. No one of us truly &quot;masters&quot; skillful approaches to all patients in all situations. We mature, grow in our professional experience, and hope to improve our capacity for this most fundamental of clinical tasks. Several additional techniques can support our continued learning in this domain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70370 \">table 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>There are two other special resources available to help us enhance our approaches to patients. The American Academy on Communication in Healthcare (formerly the American Academy on Physician and Patient) is an organization of health care providers committed to enriching the practice and teaching of medicine by improving the clinician-patient relationship through educational programs, research, scholarly publications, and teaching resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>A second valuable resource is the American Balint Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], which continues the work of Dr. George Balint and his wife, Enid. The Balints began their work in England during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. They developed discussion groups (now called Balint Groups) wherein clinicians present their patients' stories to each other (maintaining appropriate patient confidentiality) and then discuss aspects of the clinician-patient interactions that seem meaningful or puzzling. The goals of the discussion are increased understanding of the patient's perception of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> situation and increased personal awareness for the clinician, the consequences of which are a better understanding of how to work effectively with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>We owe it to our patients and ourselves to continue to reflect and improve our interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians must recognize the importance of managing the care of patients within a system so as to maximize quality and cost-effectiveness of the care delivered to their patients. A substantial portion of a patient's confidence in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> clinician will depend upon the clinician's skill and capacity to access and unfold the best aspects of the system for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H186684116\" class=\"local\">'Essential tasks of the contemporary clinician'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical interview has three functions: data-gathering, relationship-building, and patient education. Nonverbal communication is an important component of the interview. Attention to one's mental processes during an interview (mindful practice) improves understanding of the patient, reduces bias, and can enhance clinical judgment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Functions of the medical interview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective patient care involves four strategic elements that can be categorized as cognitive, affective, behavioral, and social. Cognitive strategies encourage dialogue that expands patients' understanding of their condition and allows informed medical decisions. Affective strategies convey empathy and facilitate patient self-forgiveness. Behavioral change strategies target a patient's readiness to seek treatment or alter behaviors. Motivational Interviewing is a particularly effective counseling method for behavior change. Social strategies involve the patient's family or community in collaborating with the patient to improve health outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Effective clinician strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;Four Habits Approach&quot; to clinical communication provides a useful and well-validated summary of clinician behaviors during a medical visit that have proven to be effective for both the patient and clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69929\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69929 \">table 10</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Desirable clinician behaviors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient-practitioner relationship is enhanced by a number of clinician attributes, including respect for patient dignity and self-determination, clinical curiosity, attention to decision-making preferences and cultural issues, accountability, and professionalism.
