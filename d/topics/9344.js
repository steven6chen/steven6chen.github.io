For cases with the potential for sudden significant blood loss, RBC units should be available in the operating room before the surgical incision (eg, cardiac surgical cases, open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, hepatic resection). If a large volume of blood loss is likely, the anesthesiologist should also ensure that additional RBC units and other blood products will be readily available, and that there are no risk factors affecting access to additional cross-matched units (eg, unusual blood type or RBC alloantibodies).

If rapid fluid and blood product administration may be required, large-bore catheters with short lumens should be employed for optimal flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. If patient positioning for the planned procedure will create challenges for obtaining additional access, all intravascular catheters should be inserted prior to final positioning, with confirmation of patency after final patient positioning.</p><p>Either peripheral or central routes of access may be selected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral venous access</strong> &ndash; Large-bore (eg, 14 or 16 gauge) peripheral intravenous catheters or a short 7 French rapid infusion catheter inserted with the modified Seldinger technique may be selected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Peripheral catheters are typically placed in the upper extremities, and may be left in place for short periods. Compared with a central venous catheter (CVC), peripheral catheters are generally associated with fewer complications. However, large-bore peripheral venous access may not be possible in some patients due to body habitus, vein fragility, or prior use of multiple peripheral veins.

In patients with poor peripheral venous access, a CVC may be the only durable large-bore intravascular option. Either a multilumen CVC or a large, single-lumen introducer sheath (typically, 8.5 French) may be used. Multilumen catheters have limited flow properties due to long length and smaller lumens, while an introducer sheath allows rapid flow through its single lumen (and may be used for later placement of a pulmonary artery catheter [PAC] if necessary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

An add-on filter for leukoreduction may be used for RBC units that were not leukocyte-reduced by the blood supplier. Most units released for transfusion in the United States have already been leukoreduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2405864533\"><span class=\"h2\">Warming before administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold and previously thawed blood products (eg, allogeneic RBC units and plasma products) are administered via a blood warmer to avoid hypothermia with resultant coagulopathy and other adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. Cryoprecipitate units are thawed to room temperature and should be administered within four to six hours of thawing; use of a blood warmer is unnecessary. Platelets are stored at room temperature and are typically infused via separate administration tubing that is&nbsp;not&nbsp;connected to a blood warmer. However, use of a blood warmer is not prohibited in hypothermic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Further administration of blood products is generally avoided if the hemoglobin concentration has been corrected to &gt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and active microvascular and surgical bleeding has ceased. </p><p>We prefer a targeted approach to transfusion that is based on point-of-care (POC) laboratory tests and use of an institutional transfusion algorithm or guideline. Goals include minimizing unnecessary transfusion, particularly in patients who are not actively bleeding, as well as optimizing treatment of coagulopathy. Frozen products are not thawed unless it is likely that they will be needed. Refrigerated products such as RBCs should be kept cold until a decision has been made to transfuse. Unused blood products are returned to the blood bank for possible use in another patient or appropriate disposal. Blood products should not be transfused to avoid wastage if they are not needed; this would expose the patient to unnecessary risks. (See <a href=\"#H1148406777\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative diagnostic testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H651264403\" class=\"local\">'Use of a transfusion algorithm or guideline'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients with obvious severe or ongoing hemorrhage due to trauma or other causes, RBCs and other appropriate blood products (ie, plasma and platelets) are transfused as soon as they are available. The target ratio for transfusion of these blood products is approximately 1:1:1 (RBC unit: plasma unit: apheresis platelet unit [one apheresis platelet unit is approximately equivalent to six pooled whole blood derived platelet units]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H15779146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Patient populations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3357598748\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of blood loss are typically based on periodic visual assessment of the surgical field and communication with the surgeon regarding perceived volume and persistence of blood loss, as well as standard quantitative methods (eg, monitoring blood suction canister volumes, number and degree of saturation of surgical sponges and drapes, and blood visualized on the floor of the operating room) and serial laboratory measurements.</p><p>A subjective assessment regarding excessive microvascular bleeding may be made after a large volume of blood loss due to developing quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in hemostatic function that result in coagulopathy. In such cases, administration of hemostatic blood components may be indicated (eg, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, coagulation factor concentrates), particularly if diagnostic tests indicate specific abnormalities (see <a href=\"#H1946109886\" class=\"local\">'Indications and risks for specific blood products'</a> below).</p><p>Notably, subjective estimates of blood loss as well as estimates based on formulas that include laboratory measurements may be inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Hence, there is no clear consensus regarding optimal methods for assessment of blood loss or prediction of development of anemia or coagulopathy requiring transfusion of blood products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148406777\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information rapidly derived from intraoperative laboratory tests for anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coagulopathy allows rational decision-making regarding transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) and other blood components. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58610253\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All laboratory tests are considered in the context of the intraoperative clinical situation, and transfusion is generally avoided if the patient is not actively bleeding.

In the absence of ongoing active bleeding, accurate assessment of a post-transfusion Hgb level can be performed as early as 15 minutes following RBC administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-transfusion-of-blood-products-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standard coagulation tests</strong> &mdash; Typical thresholds for transfusion of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in the appropriate clinical setting (eg, dilutional coagulopathy) are an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;2.0, prothrombin time (PT) &gt;18 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;60 seconds, or any of these values at a threshold of 1.5 times the laboratory reference value.

We prefer use of protocols or algorithms to guide transfusion decisions based on measurement of Hgb and hemostatic function. For patients with significant coagulopathic bleeding, we suggest use of TEG- or ROTEM-based POC tests (if available) to guide decisions and reduce transfusions, rather than standard coagulation assays (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H80035629\" class=\"local\">'General principles for transfusion decisions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H651264403\" class=\"local\">'Use of a transfusion algorithm or guideline'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We transfuse autologous, salvaged, or allogeneic RBCs for Hgb &lt;7 or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;8g/dL</span> in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients without significant ongoing bleeding. We typically use a higher Hgb threshold of &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in patients with significant ongoing bleeding or evidence of myocardial or other organ ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H2495218495\" class=\"local\">'Red blood cells'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer platelet transfusions as a component of massive transfusion protocols. In actively bleeding patients, we maintain platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> for central nervous system bleeding. Although exact platelet quantities vary, each platelet dose (ie, one apheresis unit or a pool of whole blood derived platelets) contains approximately 3 to 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> platelets suspended in 200 to 300 mL of plasma and will increase the platelet count by approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> in a non-bleeding adult (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854 \">table 4</a>). Risk of bacterial infection is higher compared with other blood components since platelets are stored at room temperature.
