A cohort study of 2,319,450 patients diagnosed and treated for ADHD in the United States compared the risk of a motor vehicle collision in ADHD patients during months when they were and were not receiving ADHD medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Men and women had a lower risk of a collision when receiving ADHD medication, 38 percent (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62; 95% CI 0.56-0.67) and 42 percent (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.53-0.62) respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339996550\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amphetamine medications for ADHD are available in immediate and sustained-release formulations and have an onset of action of 20 to 60 minutes. The immediate-release formulation of mixed amphetamine salts has a duration of up to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Some adults value the ability to target the short-acting drugs&rsquo; coverage to the desired part(s) of the day rather than the all-day or most-of-the-day coverage of longer-acting stimulants.</p><p>Guidelines for the onset and duration of clinical effect of individual stimulants, along with recommended initial and maintenance doses, are provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50379 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There does not appear to be a substantial advantage in efficacy or side effects of preferentially using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> rather than amphetamine products, or vice versa. Choice of immediate or long-acting stimulant preparations is often dependent upon the patient&rsquo;s preference, cost, needed time of coverage, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concern about the potential for abuse or diversion. Studies suggest that longer-acting stimulants may be less likely to be abused or diverted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. OROS methylphenidate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisdexamfetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisdexamfetamine</a> may be less prone to abuse or diversion, due to the difficulty of converting these products into short-acting agents. When starting an immediate-release preparation, initially a single morning dose is recommended with the addition of up to two additional daily doses over the next week or two, as tolerated.</p><p>Once a particular stimulant preparation is selected (eg, mixed amphetamine salts extended release), it is started at low dose (5 or 10 mg each morning) and titrated up at intervals ranging from weekly to monthly or longer. Because the attention symptoms characterizing adult ADHD are often subtle, more extended periods (eg, one month) are often necessary to fully evaluate the effectiveness of each dose. Titration continues until one of the following criteria are met: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No room for improvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intolerable adverse events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum dose limits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50379 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p>At each visit, the physician should elicit patient (and informant) report about the positive and negative effects of the medication, and duration of these effects following each dose. Whether the drug has been optimally effective can usually be determined in as little as a few weeks to several months. If an inadequate response to one stimulant is seen, the patient can be switched immediately (no tapering or washout is necessary) to another stimulant preparation (for example, from an amphetamine to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339996461\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of stimulants reported in adults treated for ADHD include dry mouth, insomnia, <span class=\"nowrap\">edginess/irritability,</span> dysphoria, diminished appetite, weight loss, and headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The physician should inquire whether the patient is experiencing non-therapeutic reinforcing effects (eg, euphoria), which could place the patient at added risk of abuse. Exacerbation of existing motor and vocal tics as well as new onset of tics has occurred. These side effects have generally been mild to moderate in severity. Ten percent of adults with ADHD treated with stimulant medications discontinued the medication due to adverse events in a meta-analysis of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

For this reason, we suggest medication treatment rather than psychotherapy as first-line treatment for adult ADHD. Psychotherapy can be an efficacious addition to treatment for problems with executive function, impulse control, and interpersonal functioning. (See <a href=\"#H339993675\" class=\"local\">'Comparing medication and psychotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-adult-adhd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for adult ADHD&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to selection among medications in the treatment of ADHD is described below. A table on these medications describes their onset of action, duration of effects, and usual doses, initially, for maintenance treatment, and for titration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50379 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>We suggest stimulant medication as first-line treatment for most adults with ADHD rather than a non-stimulant medication. There are no direct comparisons between stimulant and non-stimulant medications in clinical trials, but comparisons of placebo-controlled trials have found that stimulants have greater effect sizes compared to non-stimulants. (See <a href=\"#H437177536\" class=\"local\">'Stimulants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H814866\" class=\"local\">'Non-stimulants'</a> above and <a href=\"#H339996386\" class=\"local\">'Stimulants versus non-stimulants'</a> above.) </p><p>To avoid the risks of misuse, addiction, or diversion of prescribed stimulants in adults with ADHD and a history of a substance use disorder, we suggest first-line treatment of ADHD in most of these patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atomoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atomoxetine</a>, a non-stimulant with efficacy in adult ADHD. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a>, an antidepressant with established efficacy for the disorder, is a reasonable alternative in this population. In cases where these drugs were not effective and the patient did not have a history of abusing stimulants, cocaine, or club drugs, a long-acting stimulant (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisdexamfetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisdexamfetamine</a>) is suggested, with careful monitoring for signs of misuse, diversion, or addiction. In adults with ADHD and an <strong>active</strong> SUD, the SUD should be treated first and acute stabilization should be achieved prior to initiating pharmacotherapy for ADHD. </p><p>Although polysubstance administration is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], there are few reports of severe health consequences of acute co-administration of alcohol and stimulants. Nevertheless, clinicians should caution their patients to avoid simultaneous consumption of alcohol and stimulants, and limit alcohol use to one to two drinks after the expected therapeutic effects of the stimulant have likely ended (ie, in the evening after morning stimulant administration). </p><p>Several reports have documented the co-administration of stimulants and alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], potential risks extend beyond mixing the respective behavioral effects of simulant and depressants. The prior use of alcohol may have clinically significant interactions with a number of subsequently administered stimulant drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] and effects on the medications&rsquo; pharmacokinetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacodynamic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] through the production of new psychoactive metabolites such as methylphenidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-adult-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].
