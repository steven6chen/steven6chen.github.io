Both the introduction of microbes and the compromise of defenses are usually related to the dialysis procedure. We discuss the source of microbial contamination, the possible role of biofilms in preventing eradication of microbes by host defenses, and impairment of macrophages due to the peritoneal dialysis procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503780060\"><span class=\"h2\">Source of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sources of peritonitis include intraluminal (or touch contamination during exchanges); periluminal contamination (or extension from exit-site or tunnel infection); transvisceral migration from a bowel or, rarely, vaginal leak; and hematogenous dissemination from a remote source, as may occur during dental procedures.</p><p>Peritonitis is most often due to contamination with pathogenic skin bacteria, with <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> accounting for the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-therapy-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and therapy of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contamination with skin bacteria occurs when the patient is performing exchanges or <span class=\"nowrap\">connecting/disconnecting</span> from the transfer set. A patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) connects and disconnects from the transfer set at least four times per day and thus 1460 times per year; it would be na&iuml;ve to assume that bacterial contamination does not occur at times, even if the patient is maximally skilled with the dialysis technique.</p><p>The risk correlates with the number of times the patient has to connect or disconnect. Some studies have suggested an increase in risk with CAPD compared with continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) because of fewer required connections and disconnections.</p><p>The transfer system used to disconnect modifies the risk. The use of newer &quot;disconnect&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; transfer systems has reduced the rate of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>]. The older method (&quot;straight&quot; transfer system) required the patient to sequentially drain the peritoneal cavity, disconnect the spent dialysis solution, connect or spike a new bag of dialysate, and then infuse the new dialysate into the peritoneal cavity. As a result of this design, any possible microbial contamination of the spike had the potential to be infused into the abdominal cavity. The Y system is almost universally used today.</p><p>Even without contamination during exchanges or disconnects, bacteria can track along the peritoneal catheter and its tunnel. The catheter itself can be a nidus of retained microbes (particularly fungi) that grow directly into the material or under <span class=\"nowrap\">biofilm/slime</span> layers, where they are protected from host defenses.

Other studies also showed that biofilms can be present without any evidence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, biofilms may contribute to relapsing or recurrent peritonitis with the same organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a study including nearly 200 patients who initiated peritoneal dialysis between 1990 and 2000 and had experienced more than one episode of culture-positive peritonitis, approximately 80 percent (157 patients) had at least one repeat infection with the same organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. More than 50 percent of the peritonitis episodes among 124 patients were caused by the same organism, and 59 of 90 patients (65 percent) of those with more than four infectious episodes had at least half or more of their episodes caused by the same organism.</p><p>Another report found that patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis were likely to have stable biofilms, positive biofilm cultures, and a high incidence of catheter loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Intraperitoneal urokinase has been suggested as a treatment of biofilm as a potential cause of relapsing infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2936547857\"><span class=\"h2\">Compromised host defenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intact peritoneum and the defense mechanisms of the mesothelium are important barriers to the development of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Standard dialysis fluids have a high glucose concentration, which promotes microbial growth. The high glucose concentration, the low pH, and glucose degradation products (GDPs) may also alter host response. Newer peritoneal dialysis fluids that contain glucose polymers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>), amino acids rather than glucose, or fluids that results in fewer GDPs may be relatively less harmful to neutrophil and macrophage function, although this has not been proven.

Over 18 months, there were 44 exit-site infections and 87 peritonitis episodes. Patients who had an exit-site infection were much more likely to develop peritonitis within 30 days, even if the exit-site infection was appropriately treated. The risk of peritonitis decreased over time, with hazard ratios of 11.1, 5.3, and 4.9 at 15, 45, and 60 days, respectively. Surprisingly, in this study, the organisms that caused peritonitis were most often unrelated to those that caused the exit-site infection, suggesting that the mechanism of increased susceptibility to peritonitis is not straightforward. However, this observation needs to be confirmed in a larger study. Regardless of the mechanism by which exit-site infections lead to peritonitis, these data support the need for aggressive prevention and treatment of exit-site infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-prevention-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
