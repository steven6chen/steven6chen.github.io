Over 120,000 children (20 years of age or younger) receive care in emergency departments for fire or burn related injuries annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Many burn injuries are minor and do not require hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The mortality rate for children admitted to burn centers is less than 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Preventive strategies and advances in burn care have led to a world-wide decrease in burn incidence, severity, length of hospital stay, and mortality rate, especially in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Mechanisms of injury and determinants of mortality with pediatric burns are as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanisms of burn injury</strong> &ndash; Worldwide, scalds account for 60 to 80 percent of burn injuries for young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/3,4,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8-12</a>]. Among children in the United States less than five years of age with burn injuries reported to the National Burn Repository, 65 percent sustained scalds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Both the incidence and severity of scalds are inversely correlated with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Older children are more likely to be injured from fire. In the report from the National Burn Repository, 56 percent of children five years of age or older had flame burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Inhalational injury contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality for children who are injured in fires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serious injury or death occurs frequently among children who are injured in residential fires. As an example, in an observational study of children in Dallas, Texas who were injured in residential fires, 49 percent of injuries were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority of deaths (60 percent) occurred in children under five years of age. Pediatric injuries and death were greater when the injury resulted from children playing with fire.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fireworks are a seasonal cause of severe hand, face, and eye burns that have decreased over time. Children are typically older and three times more likely to be male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one retrospective report, 10 percent of children had permanent sequelae from their injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Burn injuries can also be a manifestation of child abuse. Characteristics of inflicted burns are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1678231804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Intentional burns'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Technological developments have introduced new mechanisms of thermal injury for children, but also offered preventive strategies, as evidenced by the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microwave ovens may overheat infant bottles and lead to upper airway burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hot water dispensers are increasingly common and now account for 6 percent of scald burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smoke detectors and clothing flammability standards have reduced flame burn risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mortality</strong> &ndash; Mortality from thermal burns is related to the size of the burn. As an example, an observational study of 1223 children with burns found that all children with burns &lt;30 percent of total body surface area (TBSA) survived while 6 percent of children with burns &ge;30 percent TBSA died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The presence of inhalational injury is also associated with increased mortality. In one observational report describing children admitted to a burn center with &ge;20 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burns, there was a significant difference in mortality between those with and without inhalation injury (15 and 4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For children with TBSA burns &gt;80 percent, inhalation injury did not appear to significantly influence mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mortality from burn injury appears to be highest for young children and the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/1,5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local injury, systemic response, and metabolic changes combine to determine the severity of a burn injury as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local injury</strong> &ndash; Significant thermal energy applied to skin denatures and coagulates protein, resulting in irreversible tissue destruction. Surrounding this zone of coagulation is an area of decreased tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Tissue in this zone is potentially salvageable, provided that resuscitative efforts are successful in restoring perfusion. Perfusion is increased at the outer margins of the burn. Tissue in this zone can recover as long as the patient does not experience prolonged hypoperfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The intensity and duration of thermal exposure determines the depth of a burn wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prolonged skin contact from hot liquids with high specific heat or high viscosity can result in deeper burns. Deeper burns are more common in young infants and children because their epidermis and dermis are thinner than the skin of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic response</strong> &ndash; Immediately following the burn injury, vasoactive mediators (such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and oxygen radicals) are released from damaged tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Increased capillary permeability results in extravasation of fluid into the interstitial space around the burn. Patients with large burns (&ge;15 percent TBSA for young children and &ge;20 percent for older children and adolescents) often develop systemic responses to these mediators. For patients with 40 percent TBSA or more, myocardial depression can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As a result, patients with major burns may become hypotensive (burn shock) and edematous (burn edema).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systemic capillary leak usually persists for 18 to 24 hours. Protein is lost from the intravascular space during the first 12 to 18 hours following a burn, after which vascular integrity improves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In large burns, up to 15 percent of red blood cells may be destroyed locally and an additional reduction of 25 percent of the red blood cell mass may occur due to decreased red cell survival time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This reduction in oxygen carrying capacity may exacerbate burn shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic response</strong> &ndash; Following resuscitation, children with major burns develop a long-lasting hypermetabolic response that results in a dramatic increase in energy expenditure and protein metabolism. Increases in catecholamines, glucagon, and cortisol are correlated with elevation of metabolic rate and catabolism. Levels of anabolic hormones such as human growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor are decreased for several weeks following a significant burn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;, section on 'Hypermetabolic response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence suggests that modulation of the hypermetabolic response with a variety of therapies may improve outcomes for severely burned children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;, section on 'Attenuation of the hypermetabolic response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Burn Association (ABA) has classified burns into minor, moderate, and major, based primarily upon burn depth and size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74855 \">table 2</a>). The treatment and prognosis of burn victims correlates with this classification. Thus, it is important that clinicians properly characterize the size and severity of their patients' burns. The classification of burns is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Burn size is typically expressed as the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) that is burned. Only partial and full thickness burns are included in this estimation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;, section on 'Classification by depth'</a>). A modification of the Lund and Browder chart for calculation of percent TBSA is used most often for children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67481 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The system currently being used to classify burn depth is based upon the need for surgical intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73309 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priorities for the prehospital care of patients with moderate and severe thermal burns include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide basic life support. Patients should usually receive supplemental oxygen. Children rarely require assisted ventilation. Patients with airway burns and longer transport times may require intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly transfer the patient to a hospital. Minimize interventions that delay transport.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop the burning process. Burnt clothing and any jewelry should be removed (unless stuck to the patient). Chemical burns may require immediate irrigation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Covering the burn area with a clean sheet or blanket reduces pain and keeps the child warm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid administration is not usually necessary for transport times less than one hour. Patients with larger burns and prolonged transport times may require fluid therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain may be treated with intravenous (IV), or intranasal (IN) administration of pain medications (eg, IV or IN <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>). Intramuscular administration of analgesia may be ineffective or unpredictable when given to patients with burn shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H223310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fentanyl'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Observational reports in human burn victims and experimental evidence in animals suggest that cooling immediately after a burn injury limits the area of injury and improves wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Experts recommend that the burn area be cooled with water for 10 to 20 minutes immediately following the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The benefit of cooling for longer than 30 minutes after injury is uncertain. Water temperature should be no less than 8&deg;C. Ice should never be applied to burns.

Burns are classified by size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67481 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 1</a>) and depth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn victims should be rapidly transported to the hospital, receiving basic life support as needed. Burnt clothing and any jewelry should be removed (unless stuck to the patient). Chemical burns require immediate irrigation in the field. Cooling the involved area with cold water for 10 to 20 minutes immediately after the burn may limit the extent of injury. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prehospital care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of burn victims includes rapid identification of life-threatening conditions, a careful examination to identify associated injuries, and determination of the extent and severity of burn injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51484\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51484 \">algorithm 1</a>). Early identification and treatment of associated injuries, fluid resuscitation, pain control, and prompt referral of children with major burns to burn centers improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of children with moderate and severe burns includes oxygenation, ventilation, support of blood pressure, and provision of appropriate pain control. Other management considerations include the following (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with upper airway injury should have the airway secured. All children must have reliable vascular access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that isotonic crystalloid fluids (eg, Ringer's lactate) be used for the first 24 hours of fluid resuscitation following burn injury (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). During the initial resuscitation, the Parkland formula (which uses weight) may be easier to use than the Galveston formula (which uses surface area). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Choice of fluid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Response to fluid resuscitation must be carefully monitored (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50423 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children who develop hyperglycemia should be treated with insulin to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range (eg, 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. (See <a href=\"#H6246817\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Victims of fires should undergo assessment for carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although controversial, large blisters, those that are likely to rupture, and those that are painful (regardless of size) may be removed. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Debridement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eyelid and ocular burns warrant careful assessment to identify the likelihood of scarring and subsequent lid retraction, and the possibility of direct thermal injury of the globe. (See <a href=\"#H6246824\" class=\"local\">'Eyelid and ocular burns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are being rapidly transferred to a burn unit, burns should be covered with dry sterile dressings. Ointments or creams should not be applied because they can hinder initial wound assessment at the burn center. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Wound dressing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tetanus immunization should be administered to children with burns deeper than superficial-thickness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn size and depth correlate with outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67481 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57124 \">table 1</a>). Referral criteria to a burn center include size of the burn, depth of the burn, type of injury, and the presence of other medical or traumatic conditions.
