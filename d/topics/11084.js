The diagnostic criteria for CRS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Factors that may contribute to the development of CRS include exposure to allergens and irritants, defects in mucociliary function, immunodeficiency, and infections with bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The common endpoint is local inflammation and swelling of the sinonasal mucosa and impairment of normal sinus drainage. The recognition that CRS represents a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, rather than simply a persistent bacterial infection, has led to the reexamination of the role of antimicrobials in CRS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The medical management of CRS is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes patients to obstruction, thus minimizing the incidence of infections. Despite this, all forms of CRS are associated with poor sinus drainage and secondary bacterial infections. Most patients require antibiotics to clear infections at the outset of therapy and intermittently thereafter to treat acute exacerbations of CRS. However, the role of these agents beyond these two indications remains an area of investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CRS can be divided into three distinct clinical syndromes, since the underlying causes and contributing factors as well as the response to medical or surgical management are different:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS with nasal polyposis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS without nasal polyposis</p><p/><p>The goals of medical therapy for CRS are to reduce mucosal edema, promote sinus drainage, and eradicate infections that may be present. This often requires a combination of topical or oral glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and nasal irrigation. When these measures fail, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for consideration of sinus surgery.

Among the CRS subtypes examined, only the presence of purulence and the comorbid condition of asthma were associated with alterations in microbial community composition. Among 27 patients with CRS who were followed postoperatively, better outcomes were associated with more diverse bacterial communities present at the time of surgery, along with higher relative abundances of <em>Actinobacteria</em>.</p><p>Other data suggest that the host response or lack of response to the normal sinus flora may be key to the development of sinus inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The number of organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and the likelihood of biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] are higher in chronic sinusitis than in uninfected sinuses.

In occasional patients, a secondary acute bacterial infection develops. The most common bacterial causes of acute rhinosinusitis are aerobes such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of medical therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is to promote sinus drainage, reduce chronic inflammation, and eradicate infecting pathogens. This often requires a combination of topical or oral glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and nasal irrigation. When these measures fail, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for consideration of sinus surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited evidence that antibiotics, as a single therapy, are beneficial in the treatment of CRS. Instead, a comprehensive approach to medical management, which includes antimicrobials combined with topical or systemic glucocorticoids, and sometimes other agents, is now encouraged. Studies examining the effects of comprehensive medical therapy are lacking, although most experts believe that antimicrobials are an important component of therapy for this disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One placebo-controlled trial in 64 patients with CRS evaluated monotherapy with the macrolide roxithromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients reported small but statistically significant benefits compared with placebo on the primary outcome measure of the patient's subjective perception of improvement or worsening. A potential concern is that macrolides have antiinflammatory effects; thus, the benefits with roxithromycin may have been unrelated to its antimicrobial effects. In addition, the duration of therapy was substantially longer than the usually recommended period of three weeks. A 2011 systematic review identified only this single trial as being of adequate quality for assessing the efficacy of antibiotics for CRS without nasal polyposis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Other randomized trials have compared different antibiotics and generally found similar cure rates between antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. Although observational studies have suggested that antibiotics with anaerobic coverage might provide greater efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/15,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,63</a>], this was not seen in randomized trials. However, in one of the randomized trials of more than 200 adults with CRS, the relapse rate was significantly higher in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> group compared with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> group (7 percent versus 0 percent), suggesting that including anaerobic coverage may be important for preventing relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial compared medical therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, nasal irrigation, nasal glucocorticoids) with surgical management in 90 patients with CRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The results were similar in the two groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In summary, antibiotic therapy is commonly prescribed for patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for CRS, and we suggest such therapy, even though the level of evidence remains low. For most patients, antimicrobials represent one component of comprehensive medical management. It is important to note that antibiotics should be used <strong>only</strong> in patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for CRS. The diagnostic criteria for CRS are discussed separately.

In addition, if antibiotics have been given over the past three months, a different class of antibiotics should be used.</p><p>Initial selection of the appropriate antimicrobial(s) is usually empiric. Sinus cultures are generally not necessary for community-acquired infections unless a patient fails to respond to empiric therapy. The agent(s) chosen should be effective against the most likely bacterial etiologies, including both aerobic (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>) and anaerobic pathogens (<em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em>, pigmented <em>Prevotella</em> spp, <em>Porphyromonas</em> spp, and <em>Peptostreptococcus </em>spp). If there are risk factors for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, then coverage for this should be included.</p><p>Bacterial resistance to the antibiotics used for the treatment of rhinosinusitis has increased in recent years.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evolution of bacterial flora'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungi may cause allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, colonization of the sinuses, and invasive fungal sinusitis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Fungi'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for CRS with antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, antimicrobials are just one component of comprehensive medical and surgical management for this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of antimicrobial regimens are available to treat CRS. Given that most of these infections are polymicrobial and many include anaerobes, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> as the first-line regimen for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For penicillin-allergic patients, we suggest monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is concern for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is usually the preferred initial therapy because it is also effective against anaerobes. Alternatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> in combination with an empiric regimen that includes anaerobic coverage. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'MRSA coverage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy is given for at least 21 days and may be extended for up to 10 weeks in refractory cases. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A culture should be obtained in patients who fail to have significant improvement or who demonstrate signs of deterioration despite therapy, preferably directly from the sinus cavity. We use the culture results to ensure that coverage is adequate for organisms resistant to the empiric regimen. We generally suggest <strong>not</strong> narrowing the regimen to cover only the organisms cultured because certain bacteria, such as anaerobes, may be difficult to isolate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
