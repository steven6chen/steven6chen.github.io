Recognition of postpolypectomy syndrome is important to avoid unnecessary exploratory laparotomy since it resolves with conservative treatment in the majority of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54586856\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome varies widely, ranging from 0.3 out of 10,000 (0.003 percent) to 100 out of 10,000 (1.0 percent) colonoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome was reported in six patients out of 16,318 colonoscopies (0.03 percent) performed between 1994 and 2002 in a large integrated health system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series described three types of cautery injury in 4784 consecutive polypectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Two patients had frank perforation, 5 had &quot;mini-perforation,&quot; and 24 (0.5 percent) developed postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study on 2106 polypectomies in 1252 patients reported that three patients (0.14 percent) were admitted to the hospital for symptoms consistent with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this study, right-sided polypectomies were associated with increased incidence of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome. All cases resolved with medical therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report included 1190 patients who underwent 1576 polypectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome was the second most common complication (after bleeding), occurring in 0.5 percent of polypectomies. By contrast, no cases were described in a report involving 1672 polypectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report of complications observed after 3355 outpatient colonoscopies, the overall complication rate was 0.24 percent, but there were no instances of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common major complications in this study included perforation and cardiopulmonary events (both 0.09 percent) and gastrointestinal bleeding (0.03 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report involving 47,083 consecutive patients placed the incidence of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome at 0.07 percent (34 patients). Complications of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome, including shock, admission to the intensive care unit, or additional surgery, occurred in 2.9 percent of incident cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were no deaths reported. Importantly, this analysis identified three independent risk factors for the development of postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.02, 95% CI 1.03-8.83), large lesion size (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.03-7.94), and nonpolypoid configuration (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.03-10.79). </p><p/><p>Reports of electrocoagulation syndrome after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection have found a substantially higher incidence (up to 40.2 percent), thought to be due to the significantly greater use of electrosurgical current involved in this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome develops when electrical current applied during polypectomy extends past the mucosa into the muscularis propria and serosa, resulting in a transmural burn without perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Serosal irritation leads to a localized inflammatory response that manifests clinically as a localized peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome occurs most often after the removal of large (&gt;2 cm) sessile polyps, which usually requires large amounts of thermal energy applied over a long duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Inadvertent capture of a piece of normal adjacent mucosa within the snare loop during snare placement over a polyp can result in this condition when cautery transects both portions of tissue (mucosa and polyp) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53817 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54587082\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During polypectomy, endoscopists should strive to minimize transmission of electrocoagulation current to the submucosal layers of the bowel wall. To this end, it is now generally recommended that polypectomy of small polyps using the hot biopsy forceps technique be abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When performing snare polypectomy, the polyp should be tented toward the center of the lumen just before heat application so that the submucosa is stretched away from the muscularis propria and serosa as the current is applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The increasing adoption of submucosal fluid elevation of large polyps prior to transection may have reduced the incidence of postpolypectomy syndrome, but there are no large studies to substantiate this hypothesis. A submucosal fluid injection prior to polypectomy (endoscopic mucosal resection) should theoretically decrease the occurrence of a transmural burn by increasing the thickness of the submucosal layer. However, four cases of postpolypectomy syndrome were reported in a series of 177 patients (2.2 percent of cases) where endoscopic mucosal resection was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic removal of large colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients usually present within 12 hours, but symptoms may occur up to seven days after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The majority of patients complain of mild ache and tenderness in the region of the polypectomy site. Some patients have localized abdominal tenderness, rigidity, fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], a symptom complex that closely resembles colonic perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who develop the clinical features described above following polypectomy with electrocautery, particularly those who had large sessile polyps removed. The distinction from frank perforation requires radiographic evaluation, which is best accomplished with an urgent abdominal computed tomography scan. In postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome, there is focal thickening of the colonic wall and periluminal fat stranding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, the presence of free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air suggests that perforation has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is conservative, consisting of intravenous fluids, nothing by mouth, bedrest, and antibiotics until symptoms improve. In one report, hospitalization was required in approximately 20 percent of patients with postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome, all of whom responded to the above treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Outpatient management with clear liquids and oral antibiotics is reasonable in patients with mild symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106948 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpolypectomy-electrocoagulation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In the presence of free intraperitoneal air, treatment is directed toward the perforation. No long-term sequelae have been described following postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome; thus patients should be reassured of an excellent prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome refers to the development of abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal inflammation in the absence of frank perforation following polypectomy with electrocoagulation.
