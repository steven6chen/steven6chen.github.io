Although there is a paucity of formal evidence-based standards of care, in 2014 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) released evidence-based guidelines for the management of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This document was developed with rigid evidence-based guideline methodology; however, many of the recommendations are moderate strength with low quality of evidence, usually based on expert consensus.</p><p>This topic review represents a synthesis of the standards promoted by various professional societies including the American Society of Hematology, American College of Emergency Physicians, and American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and regional guideline efforts, as well as the NIH and by formal attempts to define quality care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p>Each location at which clinical care is provided to children with SCD will have a different approach of how to implement the policies and patient education goals outlined below. Indeed, the categorization of common sickle cell complications may differ by program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many providers use a roadmap or outline of care that is signed off at each visit or when a milestone is reached. In addition, formal assessment of these elements of care may serve as the basis for a quality improvement project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However it is executed, it is beneficial to develop an outline of care that can be used to verify that planned educational and screening maneuvers have occurred. This is particularly true with respect to readiness for transition to adulthood education for medically complex patients. This transition to an identified adult provider is the culmination of all of the educational efforts in childhood and adolescence; this process starts in the preteen years.</p><p>The key elements of routine care and anticipatory guidance for a child with SCD are outlined here.

The SCD clinician or team will provide SCD-specific anticipatory guidance about common early childhood issues, teach the family to evaluate for complications that require urgent treatment, develop strategies to provide requisite urgent care when complications do arise, determine the necessity for prophylactic penicillin, and provide consultative recommendations for comanagement with the generalist caring for the patient. Depending upon local resources, the SCD clinician may be a pediatric hematologist (often within a specialized SCD center or program) or may be a knowledgeable general pediatrician or family physician. They should be able to provide referrals for adult providers in the geographic area to whom the patient may be referred when aging out of pediatric care. The following are essential elements of the first visit with an experienced SCD clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112753078\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urgency of timing of the first visit with the experienced SCD clinician depends upon the hemoglobinopathy. For patients with hemoglobin SS (HbSS) or hemoglobin S-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia), the first visit should be before six to eight weeks of age. For those with hemoglobin SC (HbSC), hemoglobin S-&beta;<sup>+</sup> thalassemia (HbS-&beta;<sup>+</sup> thalassemia), and other sickle cell syndromes, the first visit can be delayed until 12 to 16 weeks of age, if delay is necessitated by local resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112753085\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory testing</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirmation of exact diagnosis</strong> &ndash; The confirmation of an exact diagnosis will depend upon the testing provided by the newborn screening program. At least two separate blood tests, including the immediate newborn sample, should be used to confirm that this child is the one with the abnormal hemoglobin. Confirmatory testing may be provided by subsequent hemoglobin electrophoresis using a different technique, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based test. These tests confirm the quantity and identity of the abnormal hemoglobin present, and thus the specific type of SCD. As an example, a DNA-based test may be used to distinguish between the &quot;FS&quot; pattern seen on electrophoresis in the newborn with either HbSS or HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete blood count and reticulocyte count</strong> &ndash; A complete blood count (CBC), with reticulocyte count, should be performed at the first visit and at each subsequent visit to establish baseline values for the individual patient. The results should be interpreted in view of the physiologic decline of hemoglobin in infants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20572891\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50960969\"><span class=\"h4\">Prophylactic penicillin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin VK (125 mg twice daily) should be prescribed for all children diagnosed with HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, beginning by two months of age. There are clear and compelling data from multiple randomized trials demonstrating a reduced risk of pneumococcal infection in children treated with twice-daily prophylactic penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Children with other sickle cell syndromes may not require this prophylaxis due to the lower risk of functional asplenia or onset at a later age. Liquid penicillin will need to be refilled every 14 days, which can be inconvenient and costly for the family. Therefore, some clinicians suggest using half of a penicillin VK 250 mg tablet, dissolved in a small amount of formula or water twice a day for prophylaxis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Erythromycin</a> is the alternative for penicillin-allergic patients.</p><p>The PROPS II Study could not demonstrate a benefit to continuing prophylactic penicillin after age five, once the second dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) was given (three years after the first) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, immunization practice recommendations are that two doses of PPSV23 be given to all asplenic patients at or after two years of age and repeated five years later, thus raising a question about the correct approach in functionally asplenic children with SCD. Children with all forms of SCD should receive their first dose of PPSV23 at two years of age and, regardless of the timing of the second dose (three or five years later), twice-daily prophylactic penicillin should be continued until the second dose of PPSV23 has been administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic penicillin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fever in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Management in variant sickle cell syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50960975\"><span class=\"h4\">Folic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although 400 mcg to 1 mg daily is often recommended for children with HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and other hemolytic anemias, there are no convincing data that this is required in certain high-resource settings (eg, North America and Western Europe). Formula-fed infants in particular receive adequate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> in their diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20572848\"><span class=\"h3\">Education and anticipatory guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Education of the child's parents or caregivers about the routine and emergency complications of SCD is a cornerstone of effective medical care. Each of the following areas should be covered in the initial visit and should also be reviewed during each follow-up visit to reinforce the information and to ensure understanding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inheritance pattern and genetic risk</strong> &ndash; The clinician should inform the parents that they each carry an abnormal hemoglobin gene, and that there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of the couple having another child with SCD. Each parent should be encouraged to share the information about their trait status with any partner, so that all couples will know if there is the risk of an affected child with any subsequent pregnancy and will be able to make an informed decision about whether to take on this risk before another child is conceived. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell trait&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Splenic palpation</strong> &ndash; The family should be educated about the risk of splenic sequestration, which is heralded by splenic enlargement and an associated decline in hemoglobin and sometimes platelet counts; this may lead acutely to severe life-threatening anemia. Eventually, because of infarction, this process may lead to splenic hypofunction and to functional asplenia, placing the child at risk for overwhelming infection with encapsulated organisms. The risk for acute splenic sequestration crisis is highest in infants and young children (up to age three years) with HbSS or HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia. Persons with HbSC also develop splenomegaly and splenic sequestration, but typically this occurs at an older age (school age to adulthood) and usually is not an acute clinical problem because of the higher baseline hemoglobin in HbSC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H1667431315\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Splenic sequestration crisis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The family should be taught to palpate the spleen at least daily when the child is well and more often when the child is ill. If the spleen is felt to be enlarged by the parent, the child should be examined by a clinician to confirm enlargement of the spleen, and a blood count should be obtained and compared with the steady state value to determine if transfusion is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever plan</strong> &ndash; All caregivers should be educated that a fever (typically, a single oral temperature of 101.5&deg;F [38.6&deg;C] or above) requires urgent medical attention, even if the fever immediately comes down with or without antipyretics. Parents should be advised not to give antipyretics until the fever achieves this degree of temperature elevation. The exact degree of fever elevation may be based upon the patient's age and clinical characteristics, as well as local preference. However, generally, a temperature between 101&deg;F and 102&deg;F (38&deg;C and 39&deg;C) is selected, and a medical evaluation is recommended within four hours after fever onset. Medical evaluation should include, at a minimum, a CBC, blood culture, and empiric dose of parenteral antibiotics active against pneumococcus. A specific plan should be made for where the family should bring the child with SCD when he or she develops a fever. Options include the primary care physician's office, a local emergency department (ED), or a tertiary pediatric hospital ED or clinic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fever in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8865024\"><span class=\"h4\">How to contact the sickle cell specialist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expert advice should be available to the family of a child with SCD whenever needed. Contact information should be provided in writing to the family, for use when calling with follow-up questions or with new problems or when a complication such as fever develops that requires urgent medical evaluation. At a minimum, the family should be given contact information to allow for after-hours telephone consultation with the specialist by generalist practitioners and emergency physicians who are seeing the patient for an acute problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112753092\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following issues should be introduced during the first visit. However, detailed discussion may be delayed until later in the first year, to avoid overwhelming parents and caregivers at the first visit. Once introduced, these issues should be reviewed and reinforced at each subsequent follow-up visit.</p><p>In particular, the caregivers must have a clear understanding of symptoms requiring urgent evaluation, and they must have an action plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86907 \">table 1</a>). These medical issues can be introduced gradually, as appropriate to the child's age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20573400\"><span class=\"h2\">Painful crises or events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parents or caretakers should be educated about management of painful crises before the infant is four or five months old. Pain is the hallmark and the most feared complication in all forms of SCD. Discussions should emphasize that pain should be recognized and treated promptly, and this point should be reiterated at subsequent visits. Specifically, teaching should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of triggers for pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid becoming chilled because cold causes vasoconstriction, which may precipitate or increase pain. Encourage a shower or bath when chilled such as after swimming; massage or rub the affected area, as tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid dehydration. At the first sign of pain, oral fluid intake should be increased to twice maintenance volumes. The clinician should calculate this volume and should communicate the target hourly volume to the family in advance of the painful event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Get adequate rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimize or manage stress, because stress (by school, family issues, environment) may cause a patient to be less able to engage in appropriate self-care behaviors, and any pain that does occur may be magnified. At all routine visits starting in early childhood, social stressors should be explored and, if present, appropriate psychosocial counselling referrals be offered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recognition of pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early symptoms of a painful crisis in a young child often include decreased activity (or lying quietly). Symmetric or asymmetric swelling may develop in the dorsum of the hands or feet, which is also called dactylitis or hand-foot syndrome. The pain may or may not be accompanied by crying.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The school-aged child in the early stages of a painful crisis either may be uninterested in usual activities or may try to ignore the pain. If the pain is not recognized and treated, it may progress to overwhelming pain which is difficult to control. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to tell a trusted adult when he or she feels pain. The adult should be aware of the need for early treatment and should be educated about the different methods available to treat pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Older children and adolescents will experience pain in many ways. During office visits, the child should be engaged in discussing how to avoid triggers for their pain and how they can manage their pain at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management of pain</strong> &mdash; Details of pain management are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Families should be warned that acute chest syndrome is a peculiar complication of SCD that resembles pneumonia in another child. It may progress quickly, may result in involvement of multiple pulmonary blood vessels and airspaces, and can be life-threatening throughout the lifespan. They should be aware that it usually requires inpatient observation and parenteral antibiotics at least for initial management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Key points to communicate to the family include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any shortness of breath or trouble breathing should result in an emergency room visit, just like with fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma is both a promoter and consequence of acute chest syndrome episodes.

A patient with an episode of prolonged priapism should seek immediate medical attention to minimize the chance of permanent vascular damage to the penis, which may lead to impotence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20573460\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydroxyurea, chronic transfusion, and stem cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These three therapies are important options for all individuals with SCD. They should be discussed with <strong>every</strong> family and patient at appropriate times in the disease course. A synopsis of current thinking follows.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydroxyurea</a> &ndash; This oral chemotherapy medication, when given chronically in low doses, will decrease the frequency and severity of painful events and of acute chest syndrome episodes, and it may perhaps reduce the risk of organ damage caused by SCD. The results of two studies (HUSOFT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and BABY HUG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]) suggest that hydroxyurea may be given safely to children as young as eight months of age, although it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this age group. The benefits of hydroxyurea do not continue after the medication is stopped, nor does it help during acute crisis. Since the risk-to-benefit ratio of hydroxyurea or related decision making may change as the child grows, its use should be discussed as an option to ameliorate disease complications in HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia in early childhood (usually before one year of age), throughout the school years, and in adolescence and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. Use in other genotypes is less clear but may offer the same benefits.

This treatment decreases sickle cell complications such as recurrent pain and acute chest syndrome; it is the preferred strategy to decrease the likelihood of primary and recurrent stroke. A major limitation of this therapy is iron overload, which requires chelation to prevent organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

However, the small but real risks of death and sterility from the procedure have limited its use. At the present time, myeloablative stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor using either bone marrow or cord blood stem cells is a standard therapy available to cure SCD, although there is encouraging progress with nonmyeloablative approaches in adults. Parents of children with HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia should be advised of this option and consideration given to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of patient and full siblings at any time in childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For children who do not have an HLA-matched sibling available as a donor, the risks of HCT are higher. Unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation is under active research investigation. Unrelated donor cord blood transplantation has rarely been successful.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112753099\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP VISITS WITH AN SCD EXPERT CLINICIAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal interval of follow-up with an experienced SCD clinician is an individualized decision based upon SCD type, family needs, other medical conditions, distance from expert care, and insurance requirements. However, we suggest a minimum of a 20- to 30-minute visit at the intervals indicated below, reserved for anticipatory guidance concerning issues specific to SCD and for verification of disease-specific immunization needs, not general health maintenance. This series of visits should be <strong>in addition</strong> to those needed for general pediatric primary care.</p><p>If primary care is provided outside of the specialized SCD program, the SCD specialist should administer or advise the family and primary care provider about disease-specific vaccine requirements, which are outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112753106\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine monitoring at all visits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are essential elements of all visits to the SCD clinician:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count</strong> should be done at each SCD-specific visit (at a minimum annually), and a copy of the results should be given to the family.

Some decrement of growth often occurs between 6 and 24 months of age, corresponding to the decline in hemoglobin associated with increased beta chain synthesis. However, the subsequent rate of growth should be normal. These growth-velocity data will be vital in assessment of pubertal delays or of short stature and in related treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs including <strong>blood pressure</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] should be measured at each visit. Because of the high rate of idiopathic hypertension in the African-American community, increasing attention has been placed on the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressures in childhood. Further, early recognition and management of hypertension has become a priority because of increasing recognition of the high mortality in adults with SCD and end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35</a>]. Hypertension noted during painful crisis should be attributed to the pain. However, careful review of blood pressure values measured during routine visits will provide early clues about hypertension, especially since the lower hemoglobin values in most patients with SCD should result in blood pressures that are lower than expected for age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Room air <strong>oxygen saturation</strong> should be recorded at least annually, using a transcutaneous oxygen (TcO2) sensor. TcO2 saturations are generally lower in children with SCD compared with healthy children. Therefore, it is important to have serial measurements of each child's baseline value when healthy, to be used for comparison when the child presents with an acute issue, such as a painful crisis or possible acute chest syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended<strong> red blood cell antigen typing</strong>, at least for the Rh complex (CcDEe) and Kell antigens, which are the most immunogenic of the red blood cell antigens, should be considered in all patients with HbSS disease at a clinic visit in early childhood, in anticipation of a high likelihood of transfusion during childhood. Alternatively, some institutions offer strategies to perform this typing rapidly when transfusion is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8864157\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional age-specific recommendations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112754720\"><span class=\"h3\">Zero to two years</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervals for visits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia: Every three to four months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HbSC and HbS-&beta;<sup>+</sup> thalassemia: Every four to six months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin prophylaxis &ndash; For children treated with penicillin prophylaxis, the dose in this age group is 125 mg twice daily. Penicillin prophylaxis is indicated for those with HbSS and HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and is often used for children with other types of SCD. Prophylaxis should be started by two months of age.

These immunizations are also part of the routine childhood immunization schedule but are particularly important for children with SCD because of the risk of complications if an asplenic individual contracts these infections.

This vaccine is recommended for children with all forms of SCD because they are likely to have or to develop functional asplenia, and thus are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-polysaccharide-vaccines-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) polysaccharide vaccines in children&quot;</a>).

A single booster dose is advised every five years thereafter. The efficacy of the meningococcal vaccines in asplenic children has not been clearly established, but they are recommended for this group because they are at increased risk for meningococcal infections. Other details regarding meningococcal vaccination are discussed in greater detail separately.

A structured screening program using TCD, followed by a recommendation of chronic transfusion therapy for children with abnormal results, can dramatically reduce the incidence of primary stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. For selected patients without severe cerebral vasculopathy, following a period of chronic transfusion, transition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxyurea</a> is an option, as discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of stroke (initial or recurrent) in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>).

If significant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present, this may cause intermittent hypoxemia, which can promote intravascular sickling. There are no specific guidelines regarding screening for OSA in children with SCD. However, we suggest specifically questioning the family about whether the child snores consistently, has respiratory pauses of 10 to 15 seconds or gasping during sleep, is hard to awaken, or falls asleep easily during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Depending upon local resources, the experienced SCD clinician may be a pediatric hematologist (often within a specialized SCD program) or may be a knowledgeable general pediatrician or family physician.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants with SCD should be seen by an experienced SCD clinician by eight weeks of age. The SCD clinician or team will confirm the SCD diagnosis and type, will provide anticipatory guidance about common early SCD-specific childhood issues, will teach the family to evaluate for complications that require urgent treatment, will develop strategies to provide requisite urgent care when complications do arise, and will determine the necessity for prophylactic penicillin. (See <a href=\"#H112753070\" class=\"local\">'First visit with an experienced SCD clinician'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first visit, priorities for family education include basic genetic counseling about inheritance patterns of SCD, teaching of the technique of splenic palpation to assess for splenomegaly (splenic sequestration), a plan for urgent evaluation of the infant or child for any fever (typically using a threshold of a single oral temperature of 101.5&deg;F [38.6&deg;C] or above), and a plan for when and how to contact the SCD clinician for advice should problems arise. This information should also be reinforced at subsequent visits. (See <a href=\"#H20572848\" class=\"local\">'Education and anticipatory guidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During subsequent visits, additional education should be provided about painful crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, and priapism (in males). Families should understand these risks and should learn how to recognize and respond to symptoms. This information should be reviewed and reinforced at multiple visits. (See <a href=\"#H112753092\" class=\"local\">'Additional education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All families should learn about available treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxyurea</a>, chronic transfusion, and stem cell transplantation. The indications, risks, and benefits of each of these treatments should be discussed and reviewed in detail when appropriate.

Oxygen saturation should be measured at least annually, using a transcutaneous sensor (TcO2). The frequency of these visits may vary depending upon SCD type, family needs, other medical conditions, and available medical resources.

This procedure identifies children at an increased risk for stroke. In addition, children with poor educational performance or other possible signs of neurologic dysfunction should have further evaluation, which may include brain magnetic resonance imaging or angiography (MRI or MRA), as well as neuropsychologic testing. (See <a href=\"#H20573429\" class=\"local\">'Stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adolescent patients, routine visits should also include discussion of reproductive issues and planning for transition to adult care.
