When metastatic disease occurs, radioactive iodine can be curative in a minority of patients, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-suppressive thyroid hormone therapy can help to slow the pace of the disease. In addition, external radiotherapy may be useful in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-radioiodine-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Radioiodine treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-external-beam-radiotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: External beam radiotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, for those patients with metastatic DTC that progresses despite radioiodine, TSH-suppressive thyroid hormone therapy, and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), treatment options have historically been limited. New approaches based upon application of targeted chemotherapies are emerging as effective alternatives for progressive disease. Current and experimental chemotherapies for advanced DTC will be reviewed here. Chemotherapies for medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers are discussed separately.

Although it may take many months before radiographic response becomes evident, targeting angiogenesis (and specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] signaling pathways) has produced the most impressive clinical responses to date in DTC.</p><p>However, these drugs are disease-modifying agents, usually tumoristatic rather than tumoricidal, and no published study has demonstrated that these agents improve overall survival. In addition, these newer &ldquo;targeted therapies&rdquo; have significant toxicities and, therefore, it is important to limit the use of systemic treatments to patients at significant risk for morbidity or mortality due to progressive metastatic disease. Patients treated with systemic agents should have a baseline performance status sufficiently functional to tolerate these interventions, such as being ambulatory at least 50 percent of the day (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status 2 or better).</p><p>Although conventional cytotoxic agents are occasionally used for the treatment of patients with progressive symptomatic thyroid cancer that is unresponsive or not amenable to surgery, radioiodine therapy, or external radiotherapy, complete remission is rare and long-term responses are uncommon. In addition, the availability of multitargeted kinase inhibitors (MKIs) that can stabilize progressive metastatic disease is changing the standard approach to treating these patients, further limiting the role of cytotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12612780\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggested approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of sufficient clinical trial data comparing both efficacy and safety of any individual drug or combination, the following treatment strategy is based upon clinical experience and data from placebo-controlled randomized trials.

Randomized trial evidence supports benefit with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenvatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenvatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vandetanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vandetanib</a>. We prefer lenvatinib as first-line therapy because of efficacy, although it has not been directly compared with other MKIs in randomized trials (see <a href=\"#H5492987\" class=\"local\">'Lenvatinib'</a> below). In general, patients progressing or intolerant of one kinase inhibitor may benefit from treatment with another. Although cross-resistance has not been reported, likelihood of response is likely somewhat lower, however, with each successive regimen. </p><p>It is highly recommended that clinicians using these agents follow a comprehensive and standardized approach to assessment of adverse events during therapy, including careful documentation of the extent of baseline symptoms present prior to initiation of kinase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Small molecule inhibitors targeting signaling kinases have been of interest for the treatment of advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), given the oncogenic roles of mutations in the serine kinase <em>BRAF</em>, and tyrosine kinases <em>RET</em> (in the mutated fusion protein <span class=\"nowrap\">RET/PTC,</span> the &ldquo;<em><span class=\"nowrap\">RET/PTC</em></span> oncogene&rdquo;) and <em>RAS</em>, and the contributory roles of tyrosine kinases in growth factor receptors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Newer agents are now available that more selectively target individual kinases in key oncogenic pathways, such as <em>BRAF</em>, MEK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). </p><p>A wide variety of multitargeted kinase inhibitors (MKIs) have entered clinical trials for patients with advanced or progressing metastatic thyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Given the considerable structural similarity between <em>RET</em> and VEGFR kinases, most of the multitargeted inhibitors are capable of affecting both kinases.

Further, in the limited clinical trials that studied tumor genotyping, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">RET/PTC</em></span> fusion mutations were uncommonly seen in patients being treated for advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-refractory-to-standard-treatment-chemotherapy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Two drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenvatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenvatinib</a>) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in selected patients with refractory metastatic DTC, whereas many other drugs remain investigational for this disease.

Multitargeted kinase inhibitors (MKIs) that directly inhibit the activity of the tyrosine kinases have been successful in treating some cancers, and they hold promise for the treatment of refractory metastatic DTC. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Kinase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stable metastatic disease (tumors &lt;1 to 2 cm and growing less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year),</span> we recommend <strong>not</strong> using systemic chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). These patients should remain on TSH-suppression therapy. We perform imaging studies every six months to monitor for disease progression.

Among the MKIs, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenvatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenvatinib</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Among the other MKIs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> is our next preferred option.
