This can make the skin, lips, fingernails, and toenails look blue. Sometimes &ndash; for example, when the baby is upset or crying &ndash; the baby might turn very blue and even go limp or unconscious. This is called a &quot;tet spell.&quot;</p><p>Most people who have TOF have a heart murmur. This is an extra sound doctors and nurses can hear when they listen to the heart with a stethoscope.</p><p>A person who has TOF is born with it. Most babies born with TOF only have that condition. But some people with TOF have other heart problems or health conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774678\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors usually find TOF?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can find TOF before or after a baby is born. This can happen in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before the baby is born, with a test called an &quot;ultrasound&quot; &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the fetus. Doctors and nurses do this test to see if the baby is healthy and growing normally. It can show TOF and other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just after the baby is born, if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The baby's skin, lips, fingernails, or toenails look blue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A routine test called &quot;pulse oximetry&quot; shows the baby does not have enough oxygen in his or her blood &ndash; This test measures oxygen in the blood with a small device that goes on a finger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the baby or child is older, if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The baby's skin looks blue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The baby has &quot;tet spells&quot; &ndash; These are times when a baby turns very blue, and might even go limp or unconscious. Tet spells usually happen when a baby is active, upset, or crying.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The baby has a heart murmur</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774693\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child's skin, lips, or fingernails or toenails look blue, tell your doctor or nurse. This is very important if the blue color gets worse when your baby is crying or feeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774708\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If the doctor or nurse thinks your baby or child has TOF, he or she will order tests. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It can show if a child has TOF or another heart problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in the heart. It can show any abnormal activity from TOF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray can show changes in the shape of the heart from TOF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in the leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to the heart. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; It can show the changes caused by TOF.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774723\"><span class=\"h1\">How is TOF treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all children with TOF need surgery to fix the heart problems. Doctors usually do surgery before a baby is 1 year old.</p><p>Even if your child does not have symptoms, he or she needs surgery. This is because TOF can cause problems if the heart is not fixed.</p><p>Doctors do not find TOF in some people until they are adults. Adults who have TOF also need surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774738\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children who have surgery for TOF can live normal lives. But they still have a risk of heart problems and other health problems later. For example, some children who had surgery for TOF can have problems learning or growing normally. They need regular checkups and tests to make sure the heart is working correctly and to help with any other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3774755\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotics-before-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antibiotics before procedures (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
