All women and girls have 2 Bartholin's glands just below the opening of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The Bartholin's glands make small amounts of fluid. The fluid helps keep the vulva moist. (The vulva is the area around the opening of the vagina that includes the labia.) If something blocks the opening of a Bartholin's gland, fluid can build up and form a cyst. This usually happens in just one gland, not both at once.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70180513\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a Bartholin's gland cyst?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women notice a lump in the vulva, but Bartholin's gland cysts often do not cause any other symptoms. If they do, the main symptoms are pain or discomfort when a woman walks, sits, or has sex.</p><p>If a Bartholin's gland cyst gets infected, it can form an abscess. An abscess is a pocket of pus that can cause a lump to form on the vulva. Symptoms of an abscess include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain &ndash; A woman might not be able to walk, sit, or have sex.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70180528\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You see or feel a lump in the vulva.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is painful to walk, sit, or have sex.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70180543\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you have an abscess, the doctor or nurse will send a small sample of the pus to a lab for testing. This can show what type of germ caused the infection. You might need antibiotics for an infection caused by certain germs.</p><p>If you are older than 40, the doctor or nurse will do a test called a &quot;biopsy&quot; to check for cancer. (Cancer in a Bartholin gland is rare, but it can happen.) In this test, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the area. Then he or she sends the tissue to a lab. Another doctor looks at it under a microscope to check for cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70180558\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a Bartholin's gland cyst treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your age and whether the cyst is causing symptoms. If you do not have symptoms, you might not need any treatment. Otherwise, treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Doctors give these medicines if an abscess is caused by certain types of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Draining the cyst or abscess &ndash; In this procedure, the doctor cuts a small hole to let fluid or pus out. Then he or she puts a tiny balloon in the hole to keep it from closing completely. The balloon is connected to a tiny tube called a &quot;catheter&quot; that helps fluid drain from the Bartholin's gland. The doctor takes the balloon out in about 1 month. It leaves a small opening where fluid can drain. This procedure is often done in a doctor's office. But if you have a large or deep abscess, you might need treatment in the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors can do this if draining fluid and putting in a balloon does not work well. A doctor can make a new opening to help the Bartholin's gland drain fluid. Or he or she can remove the gland and any cyst or abscess. But surgery has a higher risk of side effects than other treatments, so doctors don't do it as often.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70180573\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyspareunia-painful-sex-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dyspareunia (painful sex) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
